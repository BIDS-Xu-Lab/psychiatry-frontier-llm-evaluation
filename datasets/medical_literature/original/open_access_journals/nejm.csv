"An 88-year-old woman presented to the emergency room with confusion. She began having transient episodes of confusion, dizziness, tremors, and anxiety a year earlier. These episodes were unpredictable, lasting for minutes and then abating spontaneously, and had been increasing in frequency since they began. The patient felt well between episodes and reported no abnormal sensation, change in weight, or relation of symptoms to meals, fasting, or physical activity. In addition, she described spells of double vision that were of sudden onset and often independent of her other symptoms. She felt well between episodes and reported no localized weakness, involuntary muscle activity, incontinence, loss of consciousness, or headaches. The review of systems was otherwise negative. She has a medical history of myocardial infarction 2 years before presentation, treated with stent placement in the left anterior descending coronary artery, as well as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and mild chronic renal insufficiency. She is widowed and a retired secretary, lives alone, independently, and does not use alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs. She takes the following medications: Aspirin, 325 mg daily; Clopidogrel, 75 mg daily; Metoprolol, 50 mg daily; Isosorbide mononitrate, 15 mg daily; Pantoprazole, 40 mg daily. She has two healthy daughters, two sisters with coronary artery disease, and one sister with rectal cancer. Her physical examination is unremarkable. Her first step of tests revealed a low hematocrit percentage of 30.1 (normal range 36-48) and a high creatinine of 1.5 mg/dl (normal range 0.7-1.3). The results of electrocardiography, echocardiography, and computed tomographic (CT) imaging of the head were unremarkable. The patient remained asymptomatic and was discharged home with an instruction to return for outpatient follow-up. Episodic symptoms continued after discharge. Two months later, a friend saw the patient in her home standing unresponsively, with a blank stare. When confronted, the patient became startled, ran, tripped, and fell to the floor, becoming minimally responsive. Her plasma glucose level, estimated by emergency medical staff with the use of a point-of-care glucose meter, was 40 mg per deciliter. She was given dextrose and glucagon and immediately regained consciousness and mental capacities. A fast was initiated when the patient was asymptomatic and normoglycemic. Dizziness and lethargy developed within 7 hours; blood tests revealed low glucose of 43 mg/dl (normal range 50-99), high insulin of 12 ulU/ml (normal range <=3 when blood glucose <50 mg/dl), and high C-peptide of 2.9 ng/ml (<=0.6 when blood glucose <50 mg/dl). Although MRI of the abdomen, performed at an outside hospital, was reported as unrevealing, endoscopic ultrasonography revealed a hypoechoic mass, 1.2 cm in diameter, in the body of the pancreas. Examination of a fine-needle aspirate from the mass revealed acinar and columnar pancreatic cells with positive staining for synaptophysin, chromogranin, and insulin. CT of the abdomen showed an enhancing pancreatic mass.",Hypoglycemic disorder.,"Recommend frequent carbohydrate-rich meals, and prescribe diazoxide for insulinoma.

"An 18-year-old woman was found in an unresponsive state in a park near her college campus. When paramedics arrived, the patient was not talking or communicating but her eyes were open, with the pupils equal in size and reactive to light. She was breathing, had a palpable and rapid pulse, and was moving her arms and legs. High-flow oxygen was administered through a face mask, and the patient was transported to the emergency department. On arrival, she vomited, with no improvement in her mental status. Endotracheal intubation was performed to protect her airway from aspiration, and a nasogastric tube was placed. The patient had a history of anorexia nervosa and depression and had previously been hospitalized involuntarily for suicidal ideation. Earlier that same day, the patient had been seen by her primary care physician, who noted that she had lost nearly 3 kg in the preceding 3 weeks, putting her total weight at 41 kg (69% of her ideal body weight) and her body-mass index (BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) at 14.5. Her physician recommended and made arrangements for admission to the hospital. The patient then left the office and called her mother, expressing suicidal ideations. Her mother called the police, who found the patient in the park. Physical exmination found a temperature of 35.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 110 beats per minute, and regular blood pressure of 72/48 mm Hg, with palpable carotid and 1+ peripheral pulses. She had a spontaneous respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100% while breathing high-flow oxygen through a face mask, and she was obtunded and very thin. Her head and neck exam showed that she was normocephalic and atraumatic. No hemotympanum noted on ear examination. Both pupils equally dilated at 6 mm, with constriction to 4 mm with light. Extraocular movements intact. No nystagmus. Her sclerae were white and conjunctivae pink. She had dry mucous membranes with no lesions. Erosions noted on lingual surfaces of anterior teeth. Her neck was supple; no thyromegaly or thyroid nodules. She had a lanugo-type hair growth on both sides of face. Her nervous system revealed that she was nonverbal; her eyes opened spontaneously, and she was able to follow simple commands. All extremities moved spontaneously, but not purposefully. She showed no withdrawal from painful stimuli and no abnormalities on a limited cranial-nerve examination. She had normal muscle tone, with patellar, ankle, biceps, and triceps reflexes 2+ bilaterally. She showed no clonus and a downward plantar reflex on Babinski test. Her lungs were clear to percussion and auscultation, no crackles or wheezes. Her extremities showed no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. Posterior tibial and radial pulses 1+ bilaterally. Her skin was cool and dry, without rashes or bruising. Pale linear scars were visible on left forearm, consistent with past episodes of cutting. She had regular heart sounds, no extra sounds or murmurs. Her abdomen was soft with no distention or organomegaly; she had hypoactive bowel sounds. The patient had a medical history of anorexia nervosa: she received the diagnosis at 14 years of age after 13.6-kg weight loss and development of amenorrhea over 6 months. She currently has regular periods every 45 days and has not taken oral contraceptives. She was admitted to hospital for nutritional support seven times and attended two inpatient eating-disorder programs. She also has a history of major depressive disorder: she has been seeing a psychotherapist since age 13 and is currently treated with quetiapine 75mg orally at bedtime and venlafaxine 225 mg orally daily. She had an involuntary admission to hospital for suicidal ideation at 15 years of age, with no prior suicide attempts. She engaged in self-injurious behavior (cutting) from 12 to 14 years of age. She is a first-year college student. Her mother lives nearby and her father recently died. She regularly uses marijuana and occasionally uses alcohol. No other known drug use. Her lab results showed elevated total carbon dioxide at 36 mmol/L and elevated lactic acid at 2.8 mg/dL, and low sodium at 131 mmol/L, low potassium at 2 mmol/L, and low chloride at 81 mmol/L. Her ECG showed prolongation of the QT interval, right-axis deviation, and sinus tachycardia.",Anorexia nervosa.,,A Patient Found Unresponsive,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMimc1204403,nejm
"A 32-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 1-month history of enlarging chest wounds. He reported a 3-year history of daily use of fentanyl adulterated with xylazine by injection into his neck and arm veins. Physical examination showed necrotic wounds on the upper chest with exposure of the underlying clavicles. Computed tomography of the chest showed osteomyelitis of the clavicles and manubrium, in addition to soft-tissue ulceration and inflammation. A tissue culture grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus species.",Xylazine-associated skin injury complicated by soft-tissue infection and osteomyelitis.,Chest-wall débridement and microsurgical flap reconstruction were performed. Intravenous antimicrobial therapy was initiated on admission and continued for 6 weeks postoperatively.

"A 13-year-old boy with a history of attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), borderline personality disorder, and major depressive disorder was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital because of worsening depression, thoughts of self-injurious behavior, and suicidality. The patient had a history of impulsivity and frequent episodes of self-injury, such as head-butting and cutting, which sometimes occurred while he was in treatment settings. Twelve months before the current presentation, he began to have suicidal ideation, with occasional suicidal planning and a suicide attempt. During the next year, the patient had 10 evaluations in the emergency department and six inpatient psychiatric hospitalizations. One day before the current presentation, the patient was discharged from an inpatient psychiatric hospital, where he had been admitted and treated for 3 weeks because of urges to hurt himself. On the day of the current presentation, the patient visited his middle school and participated in therapy at home. Throughout the day, he noticed worsening depression and had recurrent thoughts of self-injury and suicide. He asked his parents to call emergency medical services because he felt unsafe in his home. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital. On arrival, the patient was in an agitated and combative state, reporting that he had changed his mind and no longer wanted to be in the hospital. Attempts at verbal deescalation were not effective. Treatment with intramuscular olanzapine was administered, and physical restraints were placed on his arms and legs. During the next 6 hours, the agitation decreased, and the physical restraints were removed. Additional history was obtained but was limited because the patient shrugged his shoulders in response to most questions. He described the school visit as difficult and uncomfortable. He did not indicate why he felt unsafe in his home; he reported that he had picked at scabs on his arms and legs in order to hurt himself and had ongoing suicidal ideation. The patient also reported difficulty sleeping and concentrating, as well as loss of interest and motivation, although he still enjoyed playing sports. He had no homicidal ideation, paranoid thoughts, or delusions. Medications included extended-release guanfacine and lurasidone. The patient had no known drug allergies. He did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. He lived in an urban area of New Hampshire with his mother, father, and sister. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.4°C, the blood pressure 133/78 mm Hg, the heart rate 76 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He appeared disheveled. There were scattered cuts and wounds in varying stages of healing on both arms. The patient was in a disengaged and agitated state. He had a depressed mood, a guarded affect, and difficulty concentrating. His speech was slow and soft, with reduced prosody. His thought process was logical and linear; the thought content was notable for suicidal ideation. He had no loosening of associations, delusions, or hallucinations. Insight and judgment were poor. The patient was deemed to be at high risk for harm and was transferred to the acute psychiatric service of the emergency department. Transfer to an inpatient psychiatric hospital was requested, but no beds were available at any facility in the region. During the next 6 weeks, while the patient was awaiting admission to an inpatient psychiatric hospital, treatment with extended-release guanfacine and lurasidone was continued, and treatment with sertraline, diphenhydramine, and melatonin was initiated. He had frequent episodes of agitation, which led to the administration of oral clonidine or oral or intramuscular olanzapine as needed. He also had several episodes of self-injury; surveillance was heightened, with well-being checks performed every 15 minutes. On day 41 in the acute psychiatric service of the emergency department, agitation developed, and a dose of oral olanzapine was administered in addition to scheduled medications. One hour later, agitation continued, and a dose of intramuscular olanzapine was administered. After the administration of intramuscular olanzapine, the temporal temperature was 36.4°C, the blood pressure 119/65 mm Hg, the heart rate 73 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The next morning, the blood pressure was 146/87 mm Hg and the heart rate 52 beats per minute. There were no new symptoms; the examination was unchanged. Twelve hours later, the blood pressure was 69/39 mm Hg and the heart rate 88 beats per minute. The patient reported malaise and lightheadedness with standing, as well as nausea and abdominal pain. He appeared pale, tired, and lethargic. Oral rehydration was encouraged. One hour later, the blood pressure was 94/50 mm Hg and the heart rate 88 beats per minute. Three hours after the onset of hypotension, the blood pressure was 79/45 mm Hg and the heart rate 85 beats per minute. Blood and urine toxicologic screening was negative. A blood specimen was obtained for culture. Intravenous fluids, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone were administered. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no abnormalities. The patient was admitted to the pediatric medical service of this hospital.",Intentional guanfacine overdose.,"Treatment is largely supportive, with the goal of maintaining ventilation and perfusion until the toxic effects resolve. The use of activated charcoal can be considered in patients with a recent ingestion and a patent airway. Fluids are administered for the treatment of hypotension. In addition, a vasopressor such as norepinephrine may be used as a first-line agent for hypotension because it has strong α-adrenergic agonist properties. Atropine can be considered for the treatment of symptomatic bradycardia; temporary transcutaneous pacing is occasionally used for the treatment of refractory bradycardia.
Because an overdose of guanfacine (and other imidazoline derivatives) produces opioid-like effects, naloxone can be used in an attempt to reverse the effects. Naloxone may lead to a beneficial response resulting from alteration of the CNS sympathetic outflow by endogenous opioids. High doses are used, additional doses may be necessary, and the treatment is not always effective.",Case 16-2023: A 13-Year-Old Boy with Depression and Hypotension,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2201237,nejm
"A 33-year-old man was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital because of progressively worsening paresthesia.
The patient had been in his usual state of health until 8 weeks before the current evaluation, when he began to have an abnormal tingling sensation in the toes that he described as “pins and needles.” Over the course of several days, the paresthesia extended to the feet.
Six weeks before the current presentation, episodes of headache that lasted approximately 5 minutes and affected the left periorbital region began to occur on a daily basis. The headaches became less severe after the patient took acetaminophen. He had no associated nausea, vomiting, or neck pain.
Two weeks before the current presentation, paresthesia developed in the fingertips and, over the course of several days, extended to the hands and then the forearms. One week before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. The temporal temperature was 36.9°C, the blood pressure 134/82 mm Hg, the heart rate 92 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.9. He had no rash. Sensation to light touch and pinprick was absent from the toes to the midfoot.
Screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and C viruses, and Lyme disease were negative. The blood level of folate was greater than 20 ng per milliliter (45 nmol per liter; reference value, >4.6 ng per milliliter [>10 nmol per liter]), the vitamin B1 (thiamine) level 149.1 nmol per liter (reference range, 66.5 to 200), and the vitamin B12 (cobalamin) level 235 pg per milliliter (173 pmol per liter; reference range, 232 to 1245 pg per milliliter [171 to 919 pmol per liter]). Testing for anti–myelin-associated glycoprotein antibodies was negative. Imaging studies were obtained.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed. T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, obtained before the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed mild, nonspecific, scattered foci of hyperintensity involving the supratentorial white matter; the dominant lesion, which was located in the right frontal centrum semiovale and corona radiata, measured 1.4 cm in diameter. No associated abnormal enhancement was seen on images obtained after the administration of contrast material.
The patient was referred to a neurology clinic. One week later, while the patient was awaiting an appointment in the neurology clinic, paresthesia extended into the thighs and torso. The patient was advised by his primary care physician to present to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.
In the emergency department, the patient reported worsening paresthesia and loss of dexterity in his hands. He was no longer able to play guitar. He had no motor weakness, bowel or bladder incontinence, or double vision. There was no change in sensation in his face or in articulation of his speech, and he had no dysphonia, dysphagia, or shortness of breath.
Other medical history included depression and chronic knee and ankle pain after trauma. Medications included bupropion and mirtazapine. There were no known allergies. The patient was a graduate student and lived with several roommates. He was sexually active with women. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for 11 years before quitting 4 years before the current presentation. He had consumed three alcoholic drinks daily for many years, but 1 month before the current presentation, he had reduced consumption to two drinks one or two times per week. He used intranasal cocaine three or four times per week and inhaled nitrous oxide once per week. He had last used lysergic acid diethylamide and ketamine 10 weeks before the current presentation during a camping trip in rural New England; there were ticks in the area where he had camped, but he had not found any ticks on his body. The patient had a normal diet with no dietary restrictions, and there was no history of diarrhea or unintentional weight loss. His maternal grandfather had diabetes, and his paternal grandfather had gastric cancer.
The patient was alert and interactive and followed commands. The temporal temperature was 36.5°C, the blood pressure 131/82 mm Hg, the heart rate 88 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while he was breathing ambient air. He had a flat affect but was oriented to time, place, and person. Speech was fluent with intact naming, repetition, and comprehension. Cranial nerve examination was normal. Muscle tone and strength were normal. In the legs, there was reduced sensation to pinprick and to temperature that extended from the toes to the hips and flanks, with sparing of the anterior trunk and the back. In the arms, there was reduced sensation to pinprick and to temperature that extended from the fingers to the shoulders. The reduced sensation was most pronounced in the fingers and toes. Vibratory sensation and proprioception were decreased below the shins. The reflexes were 2+ in the arms but were absent in the legs. The patient was able to touch the tip of his nose with his index finger when his eyes were open but was unable to do so when his eyes were closed. His gait was unsteady, and the Romberg test was positive.",Functional vitamin B12 deficiency from use of nitrous oxide.,"Two main treatment steps are simple yet efficacious in stopping further nervous system damage. The first step is cessation of the use of nitrous oxide. Education regarding the toxic effects of nitrous oxide was provided to this patient, and his cessation efforts were further supported by consultation with the addiction medicine service. The second step is supplementation with vitamin B12, which in this patient was achieved by the administration of intramuscular injections of cyanocobalamin once daily for 5 days. In patients with normal absorption, oral and intramuscular cyanocobalamin treatments result in similar serum vitamin B12 levels; therefore, oral supplementation with cyanocobalamin once daily can be used after initial parenteral replacement. Although the most important management step is the cessation of nitrous oxide use, oral cyanocobalamin supplementation is planned to be continued indefinitely, given that this patient also had low-normal vitamin B12 levels.",Case 15-2023: A 33-Year-Old Man with Paresthesia of the Arms and Legs,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2300895,nejm
"A 25-year-old woman with a history of acute intermittent porphyria was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal pain and jerking movements of the right arm and leg.
The patient had been in her usual state of health until 2 days before this admission, when diffuse abdominal pain and nausea developed. She also felt confused and agitated, and a rash developed on her chest. One day before this admission, four episodes of jerking movements of the right arm and leg occurred, and the patient was concerned that she was having seizures. She presented to another hospital for evaluation.
At the other hospital, the patient reported that the symptoms were consistent with her previous flares of acute intermittent porphyria. She reported that jerking movements of the right arm and leg had occurred 5 minutes before her arrival at the hospital and had caused jaw dislocation; she also reported that the rash on her chest had become painful. On examination, the patient appeared uncomfortable. The mental-status and neurologic examinations were reportedly normal. The jaw was dislocated to the left, and there was diffuse abdominal tenderness. Intravenous morphine, diphenhydramine, and ondansetron were administered; an infusion of dextrose was started; and the dislocated jaw was manually reduced. The patient was admitted to the other hospital. The next day, the severity of pain in the abdomen and rash increased. Transfer to this hospital was requested because of a shortage of hemin at the other hospital.
On evaluation at this hospital, the patient described intense pain in the abdomen, a painful rash, and persistent nausea, agitation, and confusion. She was worried that she might have seizures, have blistering of the skin, or die because the hemin infusion had been delayed. Additional history was obtained from the patient. She had a history of obesity, anxiety, and chronic pain that had been attributed to acute intermittent porphyria. She reported that acute intermittent porphyria had been diagnosed 13 years before this admission, when abdominal pain, jerking movements of the right arm and leg, and a painful rash developed during menarche. During the 13 years before this admission, one or two flares of acute intermittent porphyria had occurred each year; during the 6 months before this admission, no flares had occurred.
Two previous flares of acute intermittent porphyria had been treated with a hemin infusion. During the first hemin infusion, the patient had a reaction that was characterized by intense yelling and writhing in pain, and intubation was performed to complete the infusion. Before the second hemin infusion, she received intravenous methylprednisolone and underwent elective intubation to prevent a reaction. The patient identified heat, stress, and menses as triggers for acute intermittent porphyria flares.
Medications included intravenous diphenhydramine and dextrose, which were administered daily through a central-venous-access port in the right side of the chest. The patient had previously taken intravenous morphine daily; however, she had not had access to this medication for approximately 3 months because of an inability to transport it from her home in the United Kingdom. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and penicillin had caused anaphylaxis, prochlorperazine had caused flushing, metoclopramide had caused anxiety, and fentanyl had caused altered mental status.
The patient was born in New England and had moved to the United Kingdom 15 years earlier. She was a student in a graduate program at a university in the United Kingdom and had returned to New England to visit her family. She did not use alcohol or illicit drugs, and she did not vape or smoke cigarettes. Her mother had dementia, and her father had died years earlier from an unknown cause. Her maternal grandmother had acute intermittent porphyria. Her immediate family had undergone genetic testing for acute intermittent porphyria; her brother was an asymptomatic carrier of a pathogenic variant, and her six other siblings were not carriers.
On examination, the temperature was 36.3°C, the blood pressure 144/90 mm Hg, the heart rate 100 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared older than her stated age. She was awake, alert, and oriented. She was frustrated and irritable, with pressured speech. A port in the right side of the chest was palpated. Tenderness in the abdomen was diffuse but was worst in the right upper quadrant. Erythematous plaques and excoriations were present on the arms and chest and under the breasts. The neurologic examination was normal.
Blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests. The hemoglobin level was 10.6 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0) and the platelet count 120,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000). A urine specimen was obtained for measurement of the urinary porphobilinogen (PBG) and porphyrin levels, but the amount of urine was inadequate. Oral acetaminophen and intravenous morphine, diphenhydramine, lorazepam, and ondansetron were administered. Infusions of dextrose and hemin were started, and the patient was admitted to this hospital.
During the subsequent 2 days, the hemin infusion was continued, but the patient’s symptoms did not abate. On the second hospital day, an additional urine specimen was obtained; the urinary PBG level was 0.3 μmol per liter (reference range, 0.0 to 1.3) and the uroporphyrin level 4 nmol per liter (reference range, 0 to 30). On the third hospital day, the patient reported worsening jerking movements of the right arm and leg, which she believed had caused jaw dislocation. On examination, the jaw was dislocated to the left. She did not cooperate with a manual reduction, and a surgical reduction of the jaw was performed.",Factitious disorder.,,Case 13-2023: A 25-Year-Old Woman with Abdominal Pain and Jerking Movements,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2300896,nejm
"A 27-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of convulsions.
The patient had been in his usual state of health until 2 years before this admission, when shaking of the trunk, arms, and legs occurred. The episode lasted approximately 4 to 5 minutes and had been preceded by a sharp pain in the back of the head that radiated to the neck, blurred vision, palpitations, nausea, and difficulty concentrating. The patient did not seek evaluation, and no additional convulsive episodes occurred during the subsequent 20 months.
Four months before this admission, while the patient was drinking alcohol at a party, his body suddenly became stiff, and he fell backward onto a table. Shaking of the trunk, arms, and legs occurred for approximately 5 to 8 minutes. He had urinary incontinence but did not bite his tongue. Five minutes later, similar convulsions occurred. The patient was taken to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. The results of computed tomography of the head were normal, as was an electroencephalogram (EEG) that was obtained over a period of 40 minutes. Treatment with levetiracetam was started. The patient was discharged home with a recommendation for follow-up evaluation at the neurology clinic of the other hospital.
Three months before this admission, the patient was evaluated at the neurology clinic of the other hospital. He reported that despite the use of levetiracetam, convulsions occurred approximately once per week. The results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, were reportedly normal. Treatment with lamotrigine was started. There was no change in the quality or frequency of the convulsive episodes.
One month before this admission, while the patient was at work, his colleagues found him on the floor, and they witnessed “shaking and clenching” movements of the trunk, arms, and legs that lasted approximately 2 minutes. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was taken to the emergency department of a second hospital for evaluation.
At least two additional convulsive episodes occurred at the second hospital. During one episode, the shaking movements became less intense when the physician’s hand was placed on the patient’s shoulder; the movements resumed at the previous intensity when the hand was removed. In addition, the patient’s eyes were closed. When the eyelids were opened manually, no nystagmus or gaze deviation was present. When the eyelids were released, the eyes shut forcefully and Bell’s phenomenon (upward deviation of the eyes when closing) occurred. The patient did not speak but was able to follow simple verbal commands, such as an instruction to squeeze the physician’s hands. In between the convulsive episodes, there were intermittent rocking movements of the upper body and nonrhythmic tremulous movements of the hands, and the patient did not speak or follow commands. After several hours, the episodes stopped, and the patient was able to speak. Admission to the hospital was recommended; however, the patient declined because of work obligations and anxiety about being in the hospital. He was discharged home.
During the subsequent month, the patient continued to take levetiracetam and lamotrigine. However, the convulsions increased in frequency to one to three times per week.
On the morning before the current admission, while the patient was at work, his colleagues noticed that he abruptly stopped speaking and began to have shaking movements of the arms and legs. Emergency medical services were called. On their arrival, the patient’s body was stiff, and there was twitching of the trunk, arms, and legs. No urinary or fecal incontinence or biting of the tongue had occurred. The patient was able to stand up from a chair and walk to the ambulance. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital.
On examination, the temperature was 36.2°C, the blood pressure 111/56 mm Hg, the pulse 83 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was awake and alert but did not speak. His eyes were open, with a primary midline gaze and blinking in response to visual threat. His body appeared stiff, with the arms and legs straightened. There were intermittent nonrhythmic tremulous movements of the trunk, arms, and legs. The patient was able to follow complex commands and to move the arms and legs symmetrically and against gravity, but there was a delay in motor activation. The deep-tendon reflexes were normal. Extensive scarring from burns was present on the face, trunk, back, arms, and legs.
Approximately 45 minutes after the tremulous movements had stopped, the patient was able to speak but with limited fluency. Additional history was obtained. He had been taking levetiracetam and lamotrigine as directed; however, 3 days before this evaluation, he had stopped taking these medications because he was unsure whether they were effective. That morning, he had felt well until he noticed a sharp pain in the back of his head that radiated to his neck, along with sudden blurred vision, full-body numbness, and difficulty concentrating. A convulsive episode then occurred that lasted up to 20 minutes; during the episode, the patient was aware of events but sometimes had difficulty hearing. He described his overall mood as “pretty good” and did not report decreased energy or chronic fatigue. There was no history of psychotic or manic symptoms, suicidal ideation, or obsessive or compulsive behaviors.
The patient had a history of a febrile seizure in childhood, as well as several concussions that had occurred while he was playing sports in childhood. He reported that during the first 6 years of life, his social supports were limited, and he had experienced maltreatment by a family member; he did not elaborate on the nature of the maltreatment. In late childhood, he was involved in a house fire and hospitalized for a prolonged period because of severe burns on the face, body, arms, and legs. He had asthma, major depressive disorder, chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and panic disorder with agoraphobia. He took escitalopram daily and lorazepam as needed for panic attacks. He was in a long-term romantic relationship. He did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs; he smoked marijuana approximately once per year and drank one alcoholic beverage per week. His father had died of heart disease when the patient was a teenager; his mother had schizoaffective disorder and post-traumatic epilepsy.
Blood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The blood lactate level was 2.4 mmol per liter (22 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.2 mmol per liter [5 to 20 mg per deciliter]) and the blood creatine kinase level 489 U per liter (reference range, 60 to 400).

"A 20-year-old man with bipolar disorder was transferred to this hospital because of hemoptysis and hypoxemia.
Eleven months before the current presentation, the patient received a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Six weeks before the current presentation, he was taken to another hospital for evaluation of racing thoughts, generalized hyperactivity, and difficulty sleeping. He was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for treatment. During the admission, the patient was involved in an altercation and was struck on the left side of the chest; pain subsequently developed in that area. Five weeks before the current presentation, chest pain persisted, and nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite developed. The patient was transported from the psychiatric hospital to the emergency department of the other hospital for evaluation. Imaging studies were obtained.
Computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed ground-glass opacities in the left lower lobe.
The patient was told that he had a pulmonary contusion and was transported back to the psychiatric hospital. The dosages of quetiapine and paliperidone were increased. Four weeks before the current presentation, the patient had urticaria and intermittent nausea; a single dose of methylprednisolone was administered. Three weeks before the current presentation, the patient was discharged home.
Ten days before the current presentation, chest pain continued, cough developed, and nausea increased in severity. The patient was evaluated in the emergency department of a second hospital. Imaging studies were obtained.
Radiography of the chest revealed a consolidation in the left lower lobe and a left pleural effusion.
A course of doxycycline was started for the treatment of presumed pneumonia, and the patient was discharged home. During the subsequent 6 days, the cough and chest pain abated. Four days before the current presentation, the course of doxycycline was completed. During the next several days, the cough increased in severity and became productive of yellow sputum with dark-red streaks, and shortness of breath developed; nausea also increased in severity. One day before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated again in the emergency department of the second hospital.
On evaluation, the patient appeared ill and had difficulty breathing. The temporal temperature was 37.5°C, the blood pressure 99/50 mm Hg, the heart rate 127 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 31 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The hemoglobin level was 11.3 g per deciliter (reference range, 14.0 to 18.0) and the albumin level 1.3 g per deciliter (reference range, 3.4 to 5.0). Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of liver-function tests. Nucleic acid amplification testing of a nasopharyngeal swab was negative for influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Blood was obtained for culture, and additional imaging studies were obtained.
CT angiography of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed emboli of the right and left pulmonary arteries that extended into multiple segmental and subsegmental branches. There were wedge-shaped opacities without enhancement in the left upper and lower lobes, findings consistent with infarction. There were small pleural effusions that were larger on the left side than on the right side.
Treatment with enoxaparin, vancomycin, and cefepime was started, and intravenous fluids were administered. The patient was admitted to the second hospital. On hospital day 2, the oxygen saturation decreased, and supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula. Blood cultures showed no growth. The patient was transferred to this hospital for additional evaluation and treatment.
On admission to this hospital, additional history was obtained. The chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, shortness of breath, and nausea continued. The patient reported fatigue and weight loss that had started after the injury to the chest. He had also noticed discoloration in his fingers that was associated with changes in temperature. There was no headache, abdominal pain, or joint pain.
The patient had a history of asthma, migraines, and attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder. Bipolar disorder had been diagnosed when he was hospitalized for mania, grandiose thoughts, and paranoid delusions. Medications included quetiapine, paliperidone, and methylphenidate. Sulfa drugs and valproate had caused rash, nausea, and vomiting. The patient had previously been sexually active with female partners. He drank alcohol rarely and vaped marijuana frequently; he did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. His mother, maternal aunt, paternal aunt, and paternal uncle had depression.
On examination, the temperature was 38.6°C, the blood pressure 89/40 mm Hg, the heart rate 121 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The right lung was clear on auscultation, but the left lung had diminished sounds. There was no abdominal tenderness, joint swelling, or rash. The patient had a flat affect, apathy, grandiose thoughts, poverty of speech and thought, and psychomotor retardation. There was no evidence of paranoia or hallucinations. The hemoglobin level was 8.7 g per deciliter and the albumin level 1.6 g per deciliter. Urinalysis revealed 2+ blood and 3+ protein.",Systemic lupus erythematosus with membranous lupus nephritis.,,Case 9-2023: A 20-Year-Old Man with Shortness of Breath and Proteinuria,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2211356,nejm
"A 49-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of hypokalemia and paranoid thoughts.
Six months before the current admission, discomfort on the right side of the chest developed, and the patient was evaluated at another hospital.
Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a nodule in the upper lobe of the left lung that measured 2.1 cm by 1.9 cm, as well as bulky mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.
An endobronchial ultrasound–guided transbronchial needle aspiration of a mediastinal lymph node was performed. Cytologic examination of the specimen revealed small-cell carcinoma.
Five months before the current admission, the patient sought a second opinion in the oncology clinic of this hospital. The patient was counseled about the diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer and the need for additional imaging before consideration of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy. Additional imaging was scheduled, along with a follow-up appointment. The patient did not undergo additional imaging and did not attend follow-up visits at the oncology clinic of either this hospital or the other hospital.
Six weeks before the current admission, the patient noticed swelling of both legs. Ten days before this admission, the swelling had not abated, and he was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital.
In the emergency department, the patient described himself as generally healthy and did not report any chronic health conditions. He reported no fever, chills, shortness of breath, or pain. Additional history was obtained from the patient’s brother. The patient had been pursuing alternative treatment for small-cell lung cancer that included a strict diet and intravenous infusions, and he had not shared the diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer with his family until several days earlier. The patient’s brother believed that the patient was in denial about the diagnosis.
When the patient was 12 years of age, he had received a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, which had been treated with radiation therapy and splenectomy. Fifteen years before this presentation, ischemic colitis had been treated with small-bowel resection. One year before this presentation, deep-vein thrombosis had been treated with a 4-month course of anticoagulation. There was no history of psychiatric disease. He took no medications and had no known drug allergies; he did not disclose details about the infusions that he had received as alternative treatment for small-cell lung cancer. The patient lived in a suburban area of New England with his parents. He was divorced and frequently visited his children. He worked part-time as a skilled tradesman. Family members reported that he was a lifelong nonsmoker.
The temporal temperature was 36.7°C, the blood pressure 167/95 mm Hg, the pulse 80 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The patient was alert and appeared well, but he looked thinner than he had looked during his evaluation at the oncology clinic 5 months earlier. The abdomen had a healed surgical scar, and the legs had symmetric 1+ edema. The blood potassium level was 2.6 mmol per liter (reference range, 3.6 to 5.1); the white-cell count was 14,630 per microliter (reference range, 4000 to 11,000). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Ultrasonography of the legs revealed no evidence of deep-vein thrombosis.
CT pulmonary angiography of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a marked increase in the size of the left-lung mass, which now measured 9.3 cm by 4.6 cm, as well as enlargement of the mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed numerous new ill-defined rim-enhancing hepatic lesions, which measured up to 8.0 cm in diameter; an adrenal mass, which measured 4.1 cm by 3.4 cm; and thrombosis of the branches of the right portal vein. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was normal.
Supplemental potassium was administered intravenously and orally, and the patient was admitted to this hospital. During the next 3 days, additional supplemental potassium was administered. During follow-up interviews, the patient acknowledged the diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer, but he did not explain why he had not shared the diagnosis with his family or provide details about the alternative treatment that he had pursued. On the fourth hospital day, the blood potassium level increased, and the patient asked to go home. He stated that he was willing to attend follow-up visits at the oncology clinic, but he was evasive when chemotherapy and immunotherapy were discussed. The patient was discharged.
One week after discharge, and 1 day before the current admission, the patient’s father accompanied the patient to receive massage therapy and an intravenous infusion as alternative treatment. During the infusion, the patient abruptly became volatile, agitated, and angry. On the drive home, he refused to close the window and stared into the distance. He stated that doctors had cast spells on him during his recent hospitalization and that he had killed his oldest child, which was not true.
The next day, the patient borrowed his brother’s car without permission and drove across the state. After he returned home, family members brought the patient to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.
In the emergency department, the patient stated that he was “embarrassed” for being in the hospital. He initially reported no symptoms, but on specific questioning, he acknowledged fatigue, weight loss, generalized weakness, decreased appetite, and ongoing leg swelling. He reported that he did not feel confused, afraid, or worried and that he had no suicidal or homicidal thoughts or auditory or visual hallucinations. Additional history was obtained from the patient’s family members. The patient had not slept for several days. His aggressive and erratic behavior and delusions were not typical, although he could become easily angered and had a long-standing belief that his doctors had administered radiation therapy for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma to make money.
The temporal temperature was 36.4°C, the blood pressure 194/106 mm Hg, and the pulse 87 beats per minute. The patient alternated between being alert and lethargic, and he could state the names of his children but not their ages. He was cooperative but intermittently paused and stared; he was not distracted by external stimuli, but he seemed to be responding to internal stimuli. He spoke only a couple of words at a time and answered most questions by nodding or shaking his head. There was generalized weakness, which was most pronounced in the proximal muscle groups. The leg edema was unchanged, and the skin appeared abnormally tan; there was no scleral icterus, sublingual jaundice, or asterixis.
The blood potassium level was 2.2 mmol per liter, the carbon dioxide level 37 mmol per liter (reference range, 22 to 32), and the ammonia level 51 μmol per liter (87 μg per deciliter; reference range, 12 to 48 μmol per liter [20 to 82 μg per deciliter]). The white-cell count was 13,530 per microliter. Urinalysis was normal, and urine and blood toxicologic testing was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, was normal. Supplemental potassium was administered intravenously and orally, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. On the second hospital day, the blood potassium level was 2.2 mmol per liter.",Cushing’s syndrome due to ectopic secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone from small-cell lung cancer.,,Case 1-2023: A 49-Year-Old Man with Hypokalemia and Paranoia,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2211366,nejm
"A 57-year-old woman with major depressive disorder and coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) was evaluated at a hospital affiliated with this hospital because she was having delusions that she was dead.
The patient had been in her usual state of health until 2 weeks before this presentation, when myalgias, cough, sore throat, nausea, and vomiting developed. She sought evaluation at the primary care clinic of an academic medical center affiliated with this hospital (the two hospitals are part of the same health care system). Nucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal swab was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA, and the patient was instructed to quarantine at home. She lived with her father and assisted him with activities of daily living; he also received a diagnosis of Covid-19.
During the following week, the patient’s cough persisted, and new shortness of breath developed. Her symptoms worsened; she felt that she was unable to take care of her father. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient and her father were taken to the emergency department of the other hospital, where they were both admitted for worsening Covid-19 pneumonia. The patient was treated with supplemental oxygen, remdesivir, and dexamethasone. Treatment with remdesivir was stopped on hospital day 4 when the blood aminotransferase levels increased to three times the upper limit of the normal range.
During the hospitalization, the patient was noted to have intermittent anxiety, particularly when discharge planning for her father was discussed. She and her brother declined to have their father discharged to a rehabilitation center and instead planned for him to eventually return home to quarantine with the patient. On hospital day 6, the patient’s oxygen saturation was normal while she was breathing ambient air, and the blood aminotransferase levels had improved. She was discharged home with instructions to quarantine and continue taking dexamethasone.
One day after discharge, the patient’s brother spoke to her on the telephone. He thought that she seemed to be confused and unable to take care of herself, and he asked her to return to the emergency department of the other hospital.
On evaluation in the emergency department, the patient explained that she was unsure why her brother had asked her to return to the hospital, and she said that she wanted to go home. She also expressed that she felt anxious about being home alone after discharge and overwhelmed about needing to care for her father at home once he was discharged from the hospital. The myalgias, cough, and shortness of breath had abated; she had no fevers, visual or auditory hallucinations, or suicidal or homicidal ideation.
The patient had a history of major depressive disorder, which had been diagnosed during the second decade of life. At the time of diagnosis, she had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital and had received electroconvulsive therapy; thereafter, she had been discharged to a partial hospital program. She had been hospitalized for psychiatric symptoms twice since then, once for major depressive disorder and once for a mixed bipolar episode that was due to insomnia and anxious distress. The latter episode was associated with catatonic features and was treated with electroconvulsive therapy.
The patient had no history of suicidal or homicidal ideation or attempts and no history of violence. She had hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Medications included dexamethasone, bupropion, fluoxetine, olanzapine, losartan, metformin, and pantoprazole. Sulfa drugs had caused angioedema, and lisinopril had caused cough. The patient was born in the Caribbean and had emigrated four decades earlier, first to southwestern Europe and then to the United States 2 years later. She lived in an apartment in an urban area of New England with her father, who had mild dementia. She did not drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, or use illicit substances.
On examination, the temperature was 37.2°C, the pulse 97 beats per minute, the blood pressure 153/95 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The patient was alert and oriented but guarded, with a flat affect. She appeared to be more anxious than she had been during the previous hospitalization. She paced around the room and perseverated about the care of her father. The remainder of the examination was normal.
The blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The white-cell count was 11,490 per microliter (reference range, 4000 to 11,000), with neutrophil predominance; the complete blood count with differential count was otherwise normal. Urinalysis and a radiograph of the chest were normal. Treatment with dexamethasone was stopped, and the patient was admitted to the hospital to facilitate discharge to a rehabilitation center for continued care.
On hospital day 3, the patient was noted to be more withdrawn, and she began responding to questions with one-word answers or silence. When she was encouraged to speak more, she continued to perseverate about the care of her father. When she was asked to elaborate on her concerns, she stated, “He is dead. I am dead.”
The patient appeared disheveled, sullen, and anxious. She laid in bed motionless with her eyes open and looking forward, and she responded briefly to questions in a quiet voice with slowed speech. Her thoughts were perseverative and tangential. There was no evidence that she had loosening of associations, hallucinations, or suicidal or homicidal ideation. She had poor insight and judgment. Memory, attention, concentration, abstract reasoning, and fund of knowledge were normal. When her arms and legs were lifted against gravity and released, they fell to the bed without resistance; with encouragement, she was able to move them. Muscle tone was normal, with no rigidity or waxy flexibility. Imaging studies were obtained.
Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no evidence of an acute territorial infarct, intracranial mass, or hemorrhage. There was nonspecific moderate confluent hypoattenuation involving the supratentorial white matter.
Clonazepam was administered, and the dose of olanzapine was increased. Admission to an inpatient psychiatric unit was recommended. During the next week, while awaiting placement in an inpatient psychiatric unit, the patient continued to show signs of anxiety and a depressed mood. She said, “I am dead. I do not exist. I am not real.” She also believed that her father and brother, as well as her nurses and doctors, were dead. The patient was selectively mute and motionless, but she talked and moved with encouragement. She expressed that she felt directly responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic and asked to be thrown out of the window. She had the sensation that her bladder was gone and that she could not urinate, although she had been observed urinating independently. She felt that she could not eat, although she had been observed eating breakfast daily. On hospital day 9, the patient was transferred to the inpatient psychiatric unit of the other hospital.","Cotard’s syndrome, catatonia, depression, and seizure after coronavirus disease 2019.",,Case 34-2022: A 57-Year-Old Woman with Covid-19 and Delusions,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2115857,nejm
"A 65-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of depression, recurrent falls, and difficulty caring for herself.
Four years before the current admission, the patient received a diagnosis of depression that was precipitated by psychosocial stressors. She was treated with bupropion, citalopram, and cognitive behavioral therapy. The depression was well controlled until 1 year before the current admission, when she began to have anhedonia, decreased energy, sadness, and poor concentration. She resumed cognitive behavioral therapy, but her symptoms worsened during the next 4 months, and she had suicidal ideation. The dose of bupropion was increased, and treatment with trazodone was started.
Fourteen weeks before the current admission, the patient was in a motor vehicle accident that was attributed to her falling asleep while driving. After the accident, she reported increased sadness, low energy, and inability to perform her usual activities. One week later, she fell and struck her head, and she was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital. She reported that, before her fall, she had been feeling unsteady because of weakness in the left leg. A physical examination was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed hypodensities involving the subcortical and periventricular white matter, findings consistent with chronic small-vessel disease. The patient was referred to the neurology clinic of this hospital and was discharged home.
During the next week, the patient had balance difficulties and began using a walker. When she was evaluated in the neurology clinic, she reported imbalance and occasional nausea. On examination, she had a depressed affect. Strength was assessed as 5−/5 in the proximal and distal muscles of the arms and legs. Reflexes were 1+ and symmetric at the biceps, triceps, and patellar tendons and were absent at the ankles, with downgoing toes. The gait was wide-based and unsteady, with mild dragging of the left leg. A diagnosis of postconcussive syndrome was considered, and treatment with ondansetron was started for nausea. Additional tests were performed.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed increased signal intensity in the pons and in a periventricular distribution on T2-weighted imaging, without associated contrast enhancement. There was a region of decreased signal intensity in the right corona radiata on a map of the apparent diffusion coefficient. Results of electroencephalography were normal, as were results of electromyography and nerve-conduction studies of the left leg. Physical therapy was recommended, and repeat MRI was planned for 6 weeks later.
Over the next 6-week period, during sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy, the patient was noted to be less talkative, with slow processing, impaired recall, and mild inattention. Repeat MRI with angiography performed 6 weeks after the first study revealed patchy hyperintensity involving the centrum semiovale, corona radiata, internal capsule, and corticospinal tract bilaterally on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging, without contrast enhancement; the cerebral vasculature was normal.
The patient had recurrent falls without loss of consciousness and began using a wheelchair. She reported worsening sadness, anxiety, and anhedonia, and treatment with buspirone was started. On evaluation in the neurology clinic 6 weeks before the current admission, testing of leg strength yielded inconsistent results, but strength in both legs was assessed as 5−/5 with maximum effort. Dragging of the left leg was also noted to be inconsistent. There were concerns that her depression might be contributing to her neurologic changes, and further follow-up with the psychiatric service was recommended.
Five weeks before the current admission, the patient’s husband brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for an evaluation of worsening memory impairment, poor self-care, and frequent falls. The patient had stopped participating in physical therapy and was spending most of the day in bed. She reported that she had lost 14 kg during the previous 4 months. Other medical history included hypertension, diabetes, and osteoarthritis of the knees. There was a history of postpartum depression 27 years earlier that had lasted for several months. Medications included amlodipine, buspirone, bupropion, cholecalciferol, citalopram, metformin, and trazodone. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with her husband in a suburb of Boston and worked as a teacher. She was a lifelong nonsmoker, drank alcohol only occasionally, and did not use illicit drugs. Her mother had a history of anxiety and depression in her seventh decade of life. Her sister had a history of stroke.
On examination, the patient appeared tired and disheveled, with psychomotor retardation. Strength in both legs was assessed as 5/5. She had a monoplegic gait, with buckling of the left leg, when walking down a hallway, but she had a normal gait when walking on a treadmill. Her score on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment was 25, indicating mild cognitive impairment; scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function. The complete blood count, results of liver-function and kidney-function tests, and blood levels of cobalamin, thyrotropin, and electrolytes were normal. Screening for syphilis, Lyme disease, and the human immunodeficiency virus was negative, as was urine toxicologic screening. After an evaluation by a neurology consultant, the patient was voluntarily admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit.
While the patient was in the hospital, the dose of citalopram was tapered, and treatment with desvenlafaxine and amphetamine–dextroamphetamine was started; her levels of attention and wakefulness increased. She participated in group psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and occupational and physical therapy. She continued to have variable weakness in the left leg and had three witnessed falls, during which she reportedly had fatigue and lowered herself to the ground.
On hospital day 11, the patient reported being unable to use her left arm because of weakness. Although her left arm rested across her chest for most of the day, she was observed holding her husband’s hand with her left hand when saying goodbye. On evaluation by a neurology consultant, strength in the left arm was assessed as 5/5. The working diagnosis was functional neurologic disorder. On hospital day 12, the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation center.
At the rehabilitation center, the patient received physical, occupational, and speech therapy, as well as medications to treat depression. During the first week, she made progress toward independence in bathing, toileting, and grooming but had limited attention, memory, and problem solving. During the second week, she became more withdrawn. There was a paucity of speech with hypophonia, decreased attention, and less eye contact with visitors who sat on her left side than with visitors who sat on her right side. During the third week, the patient stopped answering questions and following commands. She was evaluated again in the emergency department of this hospital.
On examination, the temperature was 36.7°C, the blood pressure 141/90 mm Hg, the pulse 98 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was withdrawn and minimally interactive. She was able to state her name but not the date or location. She did not blink in response to threat on the left side and did not track the examiner’s finger past the midline to the left. There was flattening of the left nasolabial fold. The left arm was hypertonic and held in flexion; there was no spontaneous movement of the left arm or leg, and she declined to participate in a strength examination. She did not withdraw the left arm in response to nail-bed pressure; she withdrew the left foot with antigravity movement in response to tactile stimulation.
The white-cell count was 12,940 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), with a normal differential count. The remainder of the complete blood count was normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests and blood levels of electrolytes.",Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,,"Case 7-2022: A 65-Year-Old Woman with Depression, Recurrent Falls, and Inability to Care for Herself",https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2115853,nejm
"A 67-year-old man was evaluated in the sleep clinic at this hospital because of odd behaviors during sleep, daytime sleepiness, and apnea detected on a home sleep study.
Three years before the current evaluation, the patient’s wife noticed that the patient had vocalizations, including talking and yelling, while sleeping. He also had thrashing movements while sleeping; he fell out of bed more than once and inadvertently hit his wife during these movements.
Two years before the current evaluation, the patient’s wife noticed that the patient had prolonged episodes of daytime sleepiness. During the episodes, he appeared to fall asleep while sitting up and was unresponsive to shaking and loud voices; several hours later, he returned to normal interaction without any intervention. The daytime sleepiness was intermittent and fluctuated in severity.
Four months before the current evaluation, the patient fell asleep while washing dishes. This resulted in a fall and unstable C1 spinal fracture, which required urgent surgical repair. After the surgical repair, melatonin and trazodone were prescribed for insomnia, and abnormal movements during sleep abated. However, vocalizations during sleep — including singing, talking, and expression of fear and anger in the context of upsetting dreams — continued and were most prominent in the early morning hours.
The patient also had a motor neurologic syndrome that had started before the onset of sleep symptoms, approximately 3.5 years before the current evaluation. Symptoms included progressive gait imbalance with falls, hand clumsiness, hoarse voice, and dysphagia. Serial neurologic examinations, performed over a 3-year period by multiple neuromuscular specialists, revealed slow progression of generalized fasciculations and the development of bulbar hyperreflexia, postural instability, and hypophonia, although strength in the arms and legs remained intact. Serial electromyography revealed progressive and widespread involvement of muscles showing chronic reinnervation changes, including eventual involvement of craniobulbar muscles (tongue and masseter muscles).
One year before the current evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine revealed moderate neural foraminal narrowing at the level of C3–C4 bilaterally and no central canal stenosis. Four months before the current evaluation, MRI of the head revealed a punctate subacute infarct in the left posterior centrum semiovale, chronic infarcts in the left middle frontal gyrus and right cerebellum, and nonspecific moderate-to-severe white-matter changes.
Blood tests for paraneoplastic, nutritional, and paraproteinemic causes of the patient’s neurologic syndrome were unrevealing. A diagnosis of slowly progressive motor neuron disease was made, and therapy with riluzole was begun. A videofluoroscopic swallowing study revealed severe oropharyngeal dysphagia with laryngeal penetration and silent aspiration; a gastrostomy tube was placed, and tube feeding was initiated.
The patient underwent a home sleep-apnea test, which showed sleep-disordered breathing with an apnea–hypopnea index of 20 events per hour; hypoxemia was present at rest while he was breathing ambient air. Severe oxygen desaturation occurred with frequent respiratory events while he was asleep in the supine position. The patient was then referred to the sleep clinic for an initial evaluation.
On evaluation in the sleep clinic, the patient reported that obstructive sleep apnea had been diagnosed on the basis of a home sleep study performed 1 year earlier. Multiple attempts at treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) had been unsuccessful; there had been difficulty in finding a mask that fit comfortably.
In addition to the sleep and motor neurologic syndrome described previously, the patient’s symptoms included snoring, difficulty with sleep initiation, forgetfulness, poor judgment regarding his ability to safely complete physical tasks, urinary urgency and frequency, and night sweats. He had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which was well controlled with insulin and had been complicated by mild, stable, length-dependent sensory polyneuropathy; other history included hyperlipidemia, a heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation, depression, orthostatic hypotension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Medications included alprazolam, bupropion, fenofibrate, insulin, melatonin, metformin, riluzole, sertraline, and trazodone; there were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in New England with his wife. He was a retired engineer. He drank two alcoholic beverages per day. He did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. His mother had died from an unknown cause at an elderly age; his father had died from trauma. One of his brothers had cerebrovascular disease, and another had schizophrenia.
On examination, the temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 112/60 mm Hg, the pulse 83 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.2. The patient was awake, alert, and oriented, although his attention was somewhat diminished. He could recall two words out of three. Naming and repetition were intact. The pupils were equally reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular movements were intact, and visual fields were full. Facial sensation and strength were normal. Speech was hypophonic and mildly slurred. Elevation of the palate was symmetric, and movement of the tongue was normal. Shoulder shrug was symmetric. Strength was 5/5 in all muscle groups. Deep-tendon reflexes were brisk in the arms, with mild spasticity in the legs. Plantar responses were normal. Vibratory sensation in the legs was mildly diminished. Results of finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin testing were normal. There were mild myoclonic movements in both hands. Alternating movements were mildly clumsy. Tone was slightly increased in the legs. The gait was on a narrow base and was unsteady; the patient was unable to walk with a tandem gait. The Romberg test showed truncal titubation.
A sleep study to determine the appropriate positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy was performed. In CPAP mode, there was good control of respiratory events. Electromyographic signals revealed elevated muscle tone during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, but there were no abnormal behaviors.
Two weeks later, during a follow-up visit in the neuromuscular clinic, the patient became unresponsive to sternal rub; the vital signs and blood glucose level were normal. He was transported to the emergency department, where he returned to a normal level of consciousness without intervention. Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed frequent intermittent diffuse polymorphic delta slowing of the background, often with bifrontal predominance, but showed no epileptiform abnormalities. The patient was fitted with a mask for CPAP, and treatment was initiated. Several weeks after the initiation of treatment, download of CPAP data revealed good effectiveness and adherence.
However, episodes of unresponsiveness increased in frequency and lasted up to 3 hours at a time. During the episodes, the patient’s wife was unable to arouse him despite performing a sternal rub. Modafinil was prescribed, but the episodes did not abate. The patient was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for long-term monitoring and EEG. During the admission, two episodes of unresponsiveness occurred, during which the patient had a normal blood pressure, heart rate, and glucose level and EEG revealed findings consistent with sleep.",Anti-IgLON5 IgG–associated neurologic disorder.,,Case 1-2022: A 67-Year-Old Man with Motor Neuron Disease and Odd Behaviors during Sleep,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2115844,nejm
"A 76-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal pain, anorexia, weight loss, memory impairment, and suicidal ideation.
The patient had been in her usual state of health until 2 months before this admission, when she began having epigastric pain and anorexia associated with new constipation. Findings on upper and lower endoscopy were reportedly normal, as were the results of serologic testing for celiac disease.
Fifteen days before this admission, the abdominal pain worsened. Ten days before this admission, the patient was admitted to another hospital because of diffuse abdominal pain associated with nausea and poor oral intake. On examination, the patient appeared pale. The abdomen was soft and nontender. The patient was alert and oriented to time, place, and person but had difficulty with word finding. Initial laboratory test results were notable for normocytic anemia and an elevated bilirubin level.
On admission to the other hospital, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. There was evidence of a previous cholecystectomy, the common bile duct measured 7 mm in diameter (reference range, <10 mm after cholecystectomy), and there was mild anasarca with diffuse mesenteric edema. On magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, the common bile duct again measured 7 mm in diameter; findings were otherwise normal.
After admission to the other hospital, 1 unit of packed red cells was transfused, and the hemoglobin level remained stable thereafter. On the third hospital day, the patient could eat small amounts of food. On further questioning, the patient expressed suicidal ideation and reported a history of prolonged domestic abuse; she was evaluated by the psychiatry service. A diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder was made, and lorazepam was administered. The suicidal ideation resolved, but she was noted to need substantial assistance with self-care. While plans were being made for the patient’s discharge to an assisted-living facility, the constipation worsened, and her oral intake decreased. On the seventh hospital day, vomiting developed, and the laboratory evaluation was notable for hyponatremia, with a blood sodium level of 120 mmol per liter (reference range, 135 to 145). A nasogastric tube was placed, and 3% hypertonic saline was administered intravenously. On the eighth day at the other hospital, additional imaging studies were obtained.
Repeat CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multiple dilated, fluid-filled loops of small bowel that measured up to 4 cm in diameter and the presence of air–fluid levels and an abrupt transition point in the right lower quadrant.
Urine specimens had been sent for measurement of urinary porphyrin levels at the time of admission to the other hospital; the resulting levels were elevated, and the patient was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation.
On admission to this hospital, the patient reported persistent abdominal pain, constipation, and anorexia. The vomiting had resolved after insertion of the nasogastric tube. She reported weight loss of 18 kg over the course of the previous 4 months while she was following a limited diet. In an effort to improve the patient’s overall health, the patient’s daughter had provided her with supplements and recommended a ketogenic diet consisting of protein and cooked vegetables. The patient also reported that she had been having difficulty with memory for 2 months before this admission.
The patient had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and glaucoma. Her surgical history included remote cholecystectomy and hysterectomy. Medications included pantoprazole, ondansetron, and calcium carbonate in combination with cholecalciferol. The patient was allergic to ampicillin, penicillin, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline, tetracycline, erythromycin, nitrofurantoin, and nortriptyline — all with unknown reactions. She lived with her sister in suburban New England and reported that she was recently separated from her husband owing to long-standing domestic abuse. The patient had two children. She did not have contact with her son, and her daughter lived in India but visited regularly. Her mother had died from breast cancer. Her father and son both had bipolar affective disorder. The patient did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs.
On examination, the temperature was 36.1°C, the heart rate 95 beats per minute, the blood pressure 125/55 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 18.5. The patient appeared cachectic. There was a nasogastric tube in place. The conjunctivae were pale. The abdomen was soft and diffusely tender, without guarding, rigidity, or rebound tenderness. There was no rash. The patient was alert but inconsistently oriented to time, place, and person. Her speech was tangential, and she was unable to recite days of the week backward. The remainder of the examination was normal.
The hemoglobin level was 9.1 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0). A peripheral-blood smear showed normochromic red cells with occasional burr cells and no schistocytes. Reticulocytes, basophilic stippling, and rare nucleated red cells were present; there were no blasts, and the white cells were morphologically normal.
Ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant revealed mildly increased echogenicity and mild coarsening of the liver parenchyma. The common bile duct measured 5 mm in diameter.
Intravenous fluids and hemin were administered. On the third hospital day, the volume of output from the nasogastric tube remained elevated. The patient underwent surgical exploration for possible small-bowel obstruction. Dilated loops of small bowel with a transition point near the terminal ileum were observed; there was a loop of small bowel tethered underneath an adhesion band around which the cecum had volvulized. The adhesion was lysed, and the loop of small bowel released. There was no mass or stricture.",Lead poisoning.,,"Case 38-2021: A 76-Year-Old Woman with Abdominal Pain, Weight Loss, and Memory Impairment",https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2107354,nejm
"A 37-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of fever, shortness of breath, and suicidal ideation in March 2020, during the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).
Ten days before this admission, fever, fatigue, sore throat, cough, and myalgias developed. The symptoms did not abate after the patient took aspirin and acetaminophen. Five days before this admission, she sought evaluation at the urgent care clinic of this hospital because Covid-19 had been diagnosed in two coworkers. A test for Covid-19 was not performed because of limited test availability; tests for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus were not performed because of a statewide shortage of nasopharyngeal swabs. The patient was instructed to quarantine at home.
During the next 5 days, the patient quarantined in a room in her apartment. Her husband periodically brought food to the door of the room. The fever, fatigue, sore throat, cough, and myalgias persisted; new shortness of breath and anosmia developed. She had decreased appetite, and she consumed minimal food and drink.
One day before this admission, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea developed, and the patient sought evaluation at the emergency department of another hospital. Intravenous fluid, ondansetron, and ketorolac were administered, and she was discharged home with instructions to continue to quarantine.
On the day of admission, the patient had dizziness while standing, as well as shortness of breath, and she returned to the urgent care clinic of this hospital. The temperature was 38.7°C, the heart rate 127 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 38 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while she was breathing ambient air. The patient was anxious and tearful. The lungs were clear on auscultation. Intravenous fluid, ondansetron, and oral acetaminophen were administered. The dizziness resolved, and the fever, shortness of breath, and anxiety decreased. The patient was advised to return home to quarantine; however, she disclosed that if she were sent home, she planned to overdose on medications to die by suicide because of her anxiety and feelings of sadness and loneliness. Owing to concern about the patient’s risk of harming herself, an order authorizing temporary involuntary hospitalization was implemented. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was brought to the emergency department.
On evaluation in the emergency department, the patient reported anxiety, palpitations, and shortness of breath and noted that her anxiety and feelings of isolation and loneliness had developed during quarantine. She also reported poor sleep, decreased energy, and anhedonia. The patient described that she felt like a burden to her husband and was terrified that she would transmit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to her children, including her 4-year-old son, who had been born prematurely and had a congenital pulmonary condition.
In addition, the patient reported a 1-week history of new, recurring nightmares in which she would see herself playing with her own severed body parts; these nightmares occurred more frequently during periods of high fever. She intermittently had the sensation that someone was in the room with her while she was awake, even though she was aware that she was alone. She disclosed that, on the previous day, she had had new suicidal ideation associated with fear of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to her family and that she had taken five aspirin–paracetamol–caffeine pills at once. There had been no history of suicidal ideation or attempt, self-harm, or homicidal ideation.
The patient had a history of depression and panic attacks when she was a teenager and had been treated for less than 1 year with a medication that she could not recall; the symptoms had resolved by 19 years of age, and there had been no mental health follow-up. She also had a history of migraines, which occurred four times per week. She took aspirin, acetaminophen, and aspirin–paracetamol–caffeine as needed; there were no known drug allergies. The patient was born in Central America and had been living in the United States for 19 years. She lived with her husband, four children, and mother-in-law in an urban area of New England in a community that was predominantly Latinx and that had a high rate of Covid-19–related infections and deaths. The patient did not complete high school while she was living in Central America and was currently employed full time in a food-production factory. She reported that she enjoyed her job but that she had been reluctant to work during the Covid-19 pandemic because of concern about becoming ill; however, she described that she felt obligated to work to support her family. The patient did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had died from cancer.
On examination, the temperature was 38.2°C, the blood pressure 148/84 mm Hg, the heart rate 110 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared well-groomed and fatigued, and she was tearful with a depressed and dysphoric mood. Her behavior was described as “sullen,” and there was limited eye contact and reduced psychomotor activity. Her speech, in Spanish, was fluent but was slow and mumbling, with reduced prosody. She had no derailment of thought, delusions, or obsessions, but she ruminated on her nightmares. She stated that she had no current suicidal ideation but that she might attempt suicide if she had to return to her children and expose them to SARS-CoV-2 again.
Nucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was positive. Radiography of the chest revealed ground-glass opacities in the right middle and lower lobes and in the left lower lobe. Intravenous ceftriaxone, oral azithromycin, atorvastatin, and hydroxychloroquine were administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital.","Fear associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), causing suicidal ideation.",,Case 28-2021: A 37-Year-Old Woman with Covid-19 and Suicidal Ideation,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2107350,nejm
"A 54-year-old man was evaluated by the neuropsychology service of this hospital because of irritability, confusion, and odd behaviors.
The patient had been in his usual state of health until 9 months before the current evaluation, when he received a diagnosis of squamous-cell carcinoma of the tongue that had metastasized to the cervical lymph nodes. He underwent surgical dissection of the neck and resection of the tongue base on the right side, followed by adjuvant radiation therapy, which resulted in cancer remission. After treatment, neck pain and shoulder weakness developed and was attributed to postoperative neuropathy involving the right spinal accessory nerve.
In the context of this illness and persistent pain, the patient sought care at the cancer center behavioral medicine clinic of this hospital and received a diagnosis of adjustment disorder with depression and anxiety. During the next 8 months, the patient was seen for psychotherapy approximately every 2 weeks. Treatment for the pain included physical therapy, occupational therapy, massage therapy, acupuncture, trigger-point injections, and the use of a scapular elevation brace. Therapy with oxycodone, methadone, gabapentin, tizanidine, and duloxetine was started. Four months before the current evaluation, a sural nerve graft was placed in the right spinal accessory nerve from the proximal, functioning portion to the distal portion, but the pain and weakness did not abate.
Six weeks before the current evaluation, the patient did not respond to telephone calls for 24 hours. The police were called and found the patient unresponsive with prescription medication bottles nearby. Emergency medical services personnel arrived, and the initial evaluation, in the patient’s home, was notable for a severely decreased respiratory rate. Naloxone was administered, the trachea was intubated, and the patient was taken to a local hospital. In the emergency department, the patient was pulseless with ongoing electrocardiographic activity. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed, and epinephrine was administered; after 4 minutes, spontaneous circulation was restored. The dose of methadone was decreased, and therapy with oxycodone, gabapentin, and tizanidine was stopped. During the subsequent 6 days, septic shock, aspiration pneumonia, acute kidney injury, and delirium occurred. When these problems resolved, the patient was discharged home.
Five weeks before the current evaluation, the patient participated in a video follow-up evaluation at the behavioral medicine clinic. He expressed embarrassment and frustration related to his apparent accidental overdose. He described persistent depression, increased anxiety, and no other new symptoms.
Two weeks before the current evaluation, the patient missed a routine video follow-up evaluation at the behavioral medicine clinic, and his family was called. For the preceding 2 weeks, they had noticed that the patient was uncharacteristically agitated, irritable, talking loudly, and verbally abusive. Odd behaviors were reported. The patient had gotten lost while driving to a friend’s house that he visited frequently, had been pulled over by police for driving erratically (with normal results on a breathalyzer test), and on another occasion, had been found walking along the highway under an overpass. He called family members repeatedly in the middle of the night, and he would not answer when the calls were returned. When the family requested a police wellness check of the patient, the patient retaliated by requesting a police wellness check of the family members. After this incident, the family was advised to take the patient to a local hospital for admission.
At the local hospital, the patient reported no symptoms and noted that he had stopped taking methadone because he was concerned about a medication overdose. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 19, indicating cognitive impairment; scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function.1 Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a nonspecific hypodensity in the centrum semiovale on the left side. The patient was told he had mild dementia. Visiting nurse services were arranged, and the patient was discharged home.
One week before the current evaluation, the patient’s family reported that he had increased confusion and odd behaviors. He was unable to recall details of conversations that had happened minutes before. He could not operate the telephone or remote control and had emptied the trash can into the toilet. He had asked for his clothes to be cut off because he felt uncomfortable. Family members had been staying with the patient every night since his recent discharge because they were concerned about his safety. A neuropsychological evaluation was requested.
The evaluation was conducted by the cancer center neuropsychology service of this hospital with the use of videoconferencing technology to reduce the risk of exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). The patient acknowledged only minimal cognitive changes and was dismissive of the family’s concerns. A review of systems was notable for fatigue, moderate depression, mild anxiety, and difficulty sleeping and keeping track of time.
Additional history obtained from the patient’s family included insomnia, lumbar disk herniation, olecranon bursitis, and an inguinal hernia that had led to surgical repair in early adulthood. He had had multiple concussions as a teenager, as well as a brief loss of consciousness during a motor vehicle collision 3 years earlier. After the collision, fatigue, headaches, difficulty concentrating, and impaired memory occurred; during the subsequent 2 years, occupational therapy was provided, and the symptoms gradually resolved.
Medications at the time of evaluation included ibuprofen, acetaminophen, duloxetine, trazodone, melatonin, polyethylene glycol, and multivitamins. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived alone in a suburban area of New England with family members nearby. He had completed a master’s degree and had had a successful career; he had taken a leave of absence from work 9 months earlier in anticipation of cancer treatment. After cancer treatment, he had been unable to return to work because of pain. He was athletic, walked 3 miles daily, and enjoyed golfing. He rarely drank alcohol and had never smoked tobacco or used illicit drugs. His family history included breast cancer and dementia in his mother, hearing loss and hypertension in his father, metastatic cancer with an unknown primary source in his paternal grandfather, glaucoma and alcohol use disorder in his maternal grandmother, and a brain tumor in a more distant relative.
On video neuropsychological examination, the patient was in no distress and was adequately groomed, with normal-appearing hygiene. His affect was irritable, and the fact that he reported no symptoms suggested limited insight. His spontaneous speech was fluent and well articulated. His thoughts were tangential, and he was frequently forgetful and easily distracted; his information processing speed was slow. A formal neuropsychological assessment revealed impaired executive functioning, marked by disinhibition and poor working memory, as well as deficits in recent memory, verbal fluency, and information processing speed.",Delayed posthypoxic leukoencephalopathy.,,"Case 19-2021: A 54-Year-Old Man with Irritability, Confusion, and Odd Behaviors",https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2100272,nejm
"A 70-year-old man with bipolar disorder was evaluated at this hospital because of depressed mood, suicidal ideation, and gait disturbance.
The patient had a long history of depressive episodes, with two previous hospitalizations for suicide attempts. Approximately two decades before the current admission, he was struck on the head with a beam while working at a construction site and had a 4-cm laceration. He presented to the emergency department of this hospital, where the wound was sutured but no further evaluation was conducted.
Approximately 10 years before the current admission, around the time of his mother’s death, the patient was evaluated at this hospital because of an episode of irritability, a reduced need for sleep, and grandiosity; he reported feelings of “transcendence” and being “at one with God.” He was admitted for 1 month to the psychiatry unit of a second hospital, where he was treated with lithium and electroconvulsive therapy. Thereafter, he received outpatient psychiatric treatment on a monthly basis, as well as therapy with valproic acid and fluoxetine.
Approximately 9 years before the current admission, the patient fell on concrete stairs and had back pain with subsequent lower-leg weakness and urinary incontinence. He was evaluated at a third hospital, where magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine revealed multilevel degenerative changes, including L4–L5 spinal stenosis and central disk protrusion. Acetaminophen and physical therapy were prescribed.
Five years later (4 years before the current admission), the patient fell because of an unsteady gait and was evaluated at a fourth hospital. Neurologic examination revealed a memory deficit (with an inability to recall any objects after 5 minutes on the three-item object-recall test) and poor attention (with an inability to perform serial sevens calculations), as well as action tremor in the arms and “mildly unsteady” gait, even with the use of a cane. The remainder of the physical examination was reportedly normal. The complete blood count, results of renal function tests, and levels of electrolytes, valproic acid, folate, vitamin B12, glycated hemoglobin, and thyrotropin were normal; serum and urine toxicologic panels were negative. MRI of the head reportedly revealed no evidence of an infarct, intracranial hemorrhage, or a mass but showed mild prominence of ventricles, sulci, and cisterns. The dose of fluoxetine was decreased, and the patient was discharged 3 days later.
Additional falls occurred 2 months and 4 months later, and both times, the patient was evaluated at the fourth hospital. Two months after the most recent fall, he hit the car in front of him while driving. His psychiatrist noted that he had bilateral tremor at rest; the dose of valproic acid was reduced, and he was referred to a neurologist. Two months after the car crash, he fell while walking and was evaluated at the fourth hospital. The evaluation was notable for nystagmus and a normal valproic acid level (89 μg per milliliter; reference range, 50 to 100) despite the dose reduction; the doses of valproic acid and trazodone were reduced, and physical therapy was provided. During the next 5 months, gait instability was reduced but persisted. The patient was evaluated by two other neurologists after reporting a feeling of “imbalance.” Audiometry revealed mild-to-moderate high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Medications were considered to be a contributor to his balance dysfunction.
During the next 12 months, the dose of valproic acid was tapered and fluoxetine was stopped; the patient underwent trials of escitalopram and then sertraline for the treatment of depressive symptoms. He reported to his psychiatrist symptoms of confusion, some difficulty with memory, and decreased leg coordination. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 23 (scores range from 0 to 30, with a score of 18 to 25 suggesting mild cognitive impairment).
Fifteen months before the current admission, the patient began to have dizziness. MRI of the head, performed at this hospital, revealed an old infarct in the left corona radiata, features of mild small-vessel disease, mild diffuse brain parenchymal volume loss, and mild ventricular prominence.
Neuropsychiatric testing was performed, and the results did not suggest a neurodegenerative process. Given the patient’s progressively depressed mood, treatment with aripiprazole was started, with the dose adjusted over the following 12 months.
Three months before the current admission, the patient reported worsening depression, with hopelessness, guilt, and increased sleep. That month, his son found him unable to walk and requiring assistance to move. On examination, he had tremor and muscle rigidity; on ambulation, he had a shuffling gait and required a cane. Treatment with aripiprazole was stopped, benztropine was started, and sertraline was replaced by fluoxetine.
One month before the current admission, the patient was voluntarily hospitalized in the psychiatry unit of this hospital because of worsening depression, which he attributed to the progressive reduction in mobility and strength. He reported 3 weeks of frequent early morning awakenings, anhedonia, low energy, anorexia, difficulty concentrating, and low motivation, such that he had not paid bills or bathed. Examination was notable for tremor, muscle rigidity, and a shuffling gait. Blood levels of folate, vitamin B12, and glycated hemoglobin were normal. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 antibodies and type 1 antigen and for antitreponemal antibodies were negative. Over the 5-day hospitalization, the dose of fluoxetine was increased and treatment with lurasidone was started.
During the following 4 weeks, the patient’s ability to walk continued to deteriorate, and he required intermittent use of a walker and a wheelchair. His depressive symptoms persisted, and after he reported thoughts of suicide and feeling unsafe to his psychiatrist, he was voluntarily admitted to the inpatient psychiatry unit of this hospital. A review of systems was notable for malaise, anorexia, poor sleep, anhedonia, hopelessness, guilt, low energy, worsening gait, and chronic joint pain; he reported no recent falls or manic symptoms.
The patient’s psychiatric history included bipolar depression with suicide attempts and multiple psychiatric admissions, obsessive–compulsive disorder, and skin picking. His medical history was notable for long-standing urinary incontinence, hypertension, and sleep apnea; he had undergone laser ablation of the prostate 4 years earlier, as well as bilateral inguinal hernia repair and rotator cuff repair. Medications at the time of admission included fluoxetine, lurasidone, valproic acid, aspirin, and lisinopril, as well as lorazepam and trazodone as needed. Lithium had caused tremor, aripiprazole had caused muscle rigidity and tremor, and gabapentin had caused grogginess. The patient did not smoke tobacco, and he drank alcohol less than once monthly; he had previously smoked marijuana several times daily but had been abstinent for 2 years. He was retired from employment as a laborer. He was divorced and resided in an assisted-living facility. His family history was notable for major depression in his mother and bipolar disorder in one of his children.
The temperature was 36.1°C, the heart rate 74 beats per minute, the blood pressure 110/61 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 28.5. The patient was wheelchair-bound. He was described as well-groomed and cooperative, with appropriate eye contact. He was oriented to time, place, and person. His speech was fluent and indicated a logical thought process but was considered to be “slow.” Some of his responses seemed slow, but naming, repetition, attention, concentration, and memory were intact. His mood and affect were described as depressed, and he had suicidal ideation. Results of cranial nerve examination were normal, except for reduced facial expression. Motor examination showed mildly increased tone in the lower legs and left arm, with bradykinesia, and was otherwise normal. The gait was described as being “slow to start” with a “magnetic quality” and then as “shuffling” for a few steps. The remainder of the neurologic and general physical examinations was normal.
The white-cell count, platelet count, and levels of hemoglobin, calcium, and albumin were normal, as were results of liver-function tests.
MRI of the head, performed with and without the administration of contrast material, revealed the old infarct in the left corona radiata, features of mild small-vessel disease, and mild diffuse brain parenchymal volume loss with prominence of the ventricles and sylvian fissures. There was no abnormal enhancement. Coronal reformatted images showed a callosal angle (the angle at which the two lateral ventricles meet at the level of the posterior commissure) of 66 degrees.",Normal pressure hydrocephalus.,,"Case 10-2021: A 70-Year-Old Man with Depressed Mood, Unsteady Gait, and Urinary Incontinence",https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2027090,nejm
"A 62-year-old, left-handed man was seen in the memory disorders clinic of this hospital because of memory loss, personality changes, and odd behavior.
Approximately 5 years before this evaluation, the patient’s wife noticed that the patient was becoming more forgetful and napped frequently during the day. She also noticed that he lacked initiative in his professional work; for example, he was not charging or collecting payments for services. The patient’s coworkers observed that he was having difficulty focusing and frequently required redirection when interacting with clients. The patient had no concerns other than intermittent mild headaches.
During the next few years, the patient’s wife noticed that he became distant with family, was less talkative, and lacked interest in activities that he had previously enjoyed. He made numerous costly errors at work and also had odd behaviors. For example, he entered the kitchen of a local restaurant without permission; on another occasion, he inadvertently borrowed a vehicle from a colleague without first notifying that person. In another instance, while the patient’s vehicle was stopped for a routine traffic infraction, he became irritable and briefly evaded police, incurring several legal violations.
One year before this evaluation, the patient was seen in the neurology and psychiatry clinics of another hospital at his wife’s request. He had no concerns about his neurocognitive state. He noted that he was sleeping as little as 2 to 3 hours per night but had a good energy level. He reported intermittent mild headaches. He had no sinus pain, numbness, tingling, or constitutional symptoms. On examination, the patient was alert and oriented, with some inattention and confabulation. The remainder of the neurologic examination was normal. A complete blood count and blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were results of tests of kidney, liver, and thyroid function. Tests for antinuclear antibodies and for Lyme disease were negative. The patient received diagnoses of attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder, adjustment disorder, and avoidant personality traits. Psychotherapy was initiated, and melatonin and dextroamphetamine–amphetamine were prescribed.
The patient had ongoing personality changes and difficulties with organization and daily functioning, and he was evaluated in the memory disorders clinic of this hospital at his wife’s request. She reported that dextroamphetamine–amphetamine had not improved his overall organizational abilities. Although he was physically capable of conducting activities of daily living, he required prompting to perform tasks to maintain basic hygiene, such as bathing. He no longer participated in the management of family finances; he was unable to maintain employment and was receiving disability payments. He had new odd behaviors, such as urinating in public on a few occasions and frequently and unexpectedly visiting family members’ workplaces and neighbors’ homes at late hours. He also had obsessive behaviors, such as calling his children multiple times to confirm details before a scheduled gathering. The patient was unaware of his inappropriate and unusual behaviors. He did not report having anxiety, depression, or perceptual disturbances.
Approximately 10 years before the current evaluation, the patient had received a diagnosis of Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia. Because he was asymptomatic, treatment was deferred. Two years before the current evaluation, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed for disease surveillance. There were multiple enlarged hilar and retrocrural lymph nodes, measuring up to 1.2 cm in greatest dimension, with no evidence of organomegaly or focal osseous lesions. The patient attended routine oncology appointments for disease monitoring. Two months before the current evaluation, a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel were normal. The blood IgM level was 2850 mg per deciliter (reference range, 40 to 230), and the β2-microglobulin level 2.8 mg liter (reference range, 0 to 2.7); these values had been stable since the diagnosis of Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia was established.
Other medical history included mitral regurgitation, nephrolithiasis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, bilateral knee osteoarthritis, and spinal stenosis. There was no history of head trauma, stroke, or seizure. Medications included a multivitamin and fish oil; there were no known allergies to medications. The patient did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. He lived with his wife, and his daughters and grandchildren lived nearby. He had graduated from high school and trade school before serving in the navy for 2 years; he did not serve in a combat role or have known exposure to toxins. Both of his parents had heart disease, a sister had depression, and a maternal uncle had throat cancer. There was no family history of dementia, neurologic disorders, or psychiatric disorders.
On examination, the patient was well groomed, pleasant, and cooperative. Physical appearance was normal. His Mini–Mental State Examination score was 23 on a scale ranging from 0 to 30 (with higher scores indicating better cognitive function), and his Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score was 15 on a scale ranging from 0 to 30 (with higher scores indicating better cognitive function).
Orientation was intact except for an error in recalling the date. On testing of attention, the patient had difficulty with serial sevens calculations and with the digit-span test, in which a sequence of numbers is read by the examiner and repeated by the patient; he repeated only four digits of the forward span correctly. On testing of memory, he repeated five out of five words after two trials and did not spontaneously recall any of the words after 5 minutes; he recalled three of the words when selecting from a written list of word choices. Spontaneous speech production was diminished. On testing of confrontation naming, he identified a camel when shown a picture of a giraffe. On testing of semantic and phonemic fluency, he spontaneously generated six animal names over a 1-minute period, as well as one word that begins with the letter “F” over a 1-minute period. The clock-drawing test showed good organization. The letter–number sequencing test (also known as the alternating trail-making test) revealed impaired set shifting, and Luria’s three-step test revealed impaired motor sequencing. On testing of verbal abstraction, when the patient was asked to describe how a train and a bicycle are similar, he stated, “A train is bigger than a bicycle and would crush the bicycle.” Judgment and insight were markedly impaired.
An evaluation of cranial nerve function, sensation, power, bulk, tone, coordination, and gait was normal. Deep-tendon reflexes were normal, and the toes were downgoing bilaterally. Bilateral grasp reflexes and palmomental reflexes were present. Testing for syphilis was negative. The blood folate level was 8.2 ng per milliliter (19 nmol per liter; reference range, >4.7 ng per milliliter [11 nmol per liter]), and the vitamin B12 level 258 pg per milliliter (190 pmol per liter; reference range, >231 pg per milliliter [170 pmol per liter]).
On neuropsychological assessment, social engagement was limited, with a few moments of giggling that was incongruent with the context. Spontaneous speech was fluent but impoverished. There was frequent use of the word “thing” to replace lower-frequency words and periodic use of phonemic paraphasias such as “a fenco type of thing.” Thoughts were coherent but impoverished, tangential, and perseverative. Attention and executive functioning were markedly impaired during assessments of verbal fluency, divided attention, abstract reasoning, and inhibitory control. Visual memory was relatively intact, but verbal memory was impaired in terms of encoding and retrieval. When the patient was asked to describe an image, written language was severely impaired but oral language was relatively intact.",Frontotemporal lobar degeneration with tau-positive inclusions (FTLD-tau) consistent with Pick’s disease.,,Case 41-2020: A 62-Year-Old Man with Memory Loss and Odd Behavior,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc1916251,nejm
"A 64-year-old Haitian-American man was evaluated at the geriatric psychiatry clinic of this hospital for chronic depression, intrusive thoughts, and fear of being poisoned.
During the evaluation, the patient described his mood as “not that good.” He reported depression, which he rated as 4 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe depression). He had been having an ongoing “depressive episode” during the past 3 months, which had led him to call in sick to work frequently. He had passive suicidal ideation, questioning whether life was worth living; however, he had no specific intent or plan and no thoughts of harming other people. The patient had a history of nightmares, but they had not occurred during the past 3 months. In the 3 years before this evaluation, his startle response had been increased and flashbacks frequently occurred; however, at the time of the evaluation, his startle response was reduced and there were no flashbacks. He reported that women had attempted to poison his coffee. There were no auditory or visual hallucinations. He reported limited energy, difficulty initiating sleep, repeated early morning awakenings, and anorexia. There was no weight loss, difficulty concentrating, or history of headaches, seizure, or head trauma.
The patient’s medical history included diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, seasonal allergies, mild intermittent asthma, eczema, and chronic lower back pain associated with a motor vehicle accident that had occurred 20 years earlier. Medications included bupropion, quetiapine, aspirin, atorvastatin, ezetimibe, amlodipine, fosinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, metformin, and vitamins B12 and D3, as well as fexofenadine, naproxen, sildenafil, and inhaled albuterol as needed. Adverse drug effects included dry and painful mouth with paroxetine, reduced libido with paroxetine and citalopram, orthostatic hypotension and falls with prazosin, nausea and vomiting with lisinopril, and elevated aminotransferase levels with statins.
The patient had a family history of dyslipidemia; his brother had died of premature myocardial infarction, and his father had undergone coronary-artery bypass grafting. He had an adult child, who was healthy. There was no history of neuropsychiatric disease or substance use disorder in first-degree relatives, but male maternal cousins had major depressive disorder and schizophrenia. He worked full-time as a counselor. He visited a psychic every few weeks and was undergoing training to become a psychic and read tarot cards. He had formerly smoked a few cigarettes daily and had quit smoking when he was 30 years of age. He drank one alcoholic beverage on weekend nights and did not use illicit drugs.
The patient grew up in Haiti. His parents were devout Catholics, but many community members and relatives observed Vodou and Santeria beliefs and also practiced tarot card reading; the patient and his siblings began following Vodou and Santeria practices during adolescence. In his early life, the patient witnessed an act of police brutality in which a community member was killed, as well as the poisoning of colleagues of his father, who was a government employee. In his early adulthood, the patient immigrated to the United States. He lived in an urban area of New England, where he completed college and then worked as a counselor. He reported that he had experienced recurrent discrimination by female supervisors during his employment. In his early years of working, he encountered financial difficulties and was evicted from his apartment. During a 2-month period of homelessness, he became a victim of sexual and physical assault and subsequently had depressive symptoms, flashbacks, nightmares, and intrusive thoughts of the assault. He reported that he had not had any psychiatric symptoms before the assault.
The patient was married for a brief period and then divorced. He reported that his ex-wife had “put a Vodou curse on me” and that he had traveled to Haiti to have the curse removed but “the damage cannot be undone.” For decades, he feared that female coworkers would try to poison him. For this reason, he did not drink coffee that had been unattended in the office, did not accept offers from coworkers to bring him coffee from a local shop, and avoided eating with colleagues. He felt that people at work did not like him. He described extreme self-consciousness and was concerned that people in either a professional or social setting would see “discoloration” when they looked at his face.
In his early adulthood, the patient had sought weekly therapy at another hospital because of depressive symptoms, intrusive thoughts, and nightmares. Four years before the current consultation, and again 1 year later and 18 months after that, he sought care at psychiatry clinics at other hospitals. Meanwhile, he continued to receive care from the same therapist for approximately three decades.
Additional history was obtained from the patient’s therapist. The persecutory beliefs had been long-standing, occurring over a period of decades; they became more prominent when depressive symptoms were more active, but they were still present during periods of euthymia. The therapist observed that the patient’s persecutory beliefs affected interpersonal relationships and led to the feeling of isolation at work.
The patient had undergone multiple trials of psychopharmacologic medications for the treatment of recurrent major depressive episodes, which would occur approximately two times each year and last for several weeks to months. These medications included nortriptyline, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine, citalopram, escitalopram, bupropion, and valproic acid. He had tried prazosin, which decreased the frequency of nightmares but was discontinued owing to orthostatic hypotension. He had undergone EMDR (eye movement, desensitization, and reprocessing) therapy, but nightmares occurred up to three times per month and intrusive thoughts of the sexual trauma occurred daily. Olanzapine and aripiprazole did not reduce paranoid thoughts; quetiapine had a modestly beneficial effect.
On examination, the patient was a well-groomed older man with no abnormal facial features. His posture and gait were normal. He was calm and cooperative, with normal eye contact and speech of an appropriate rate and volume. He was oriented to time, place, and situation, with intact attentiveness and ability to recall autobiographical and historical information. His mood was described as mildly sad and anxious with a constricted affect. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.
On laboratory testing performed at another hospital during the 6 months before the current evaluation, the complete blood count and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were levels of electrolytes, thyrotropin, and folate. The glucose level was 131 mg per deciliter (7.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]). The glycated hemoglobin level (7.0%; reference range, 4.3 to 6.4) had increased from a level of 6.4% obtained 6 months earlier. An electrocardiogram obtained 4 months before the current evaluation showed sinus rhythm with a normal corrected QT interval.",Post-traumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder in the context of culturally and religiously derived beliefs and behaviors.,,Case 28-2020: A 64-Year-Old Man with Intrusive Thoughts and Fear of Being Poisoned,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2004981,nejm
"A 60-year-old woman presented to this hospital with altered mental status during the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The patient had been in her usual state of health until 1 week before admission, when cough and headache developed. One day before admission, vomiting and diarrhea developed. That day, the patient was last seen by her husband at 3:00 p.m. before she went to sleep. The husband reported that the patient awoke screaming at 1:00 a.m. on the day of admission, and emergency medical services (EMS) were called. When EMS personnel arrived, the patient was reportedly lethargic and unable to answer questions. The blood glucose level, obtained by fingerstick testing, was 60 mg per deciliter (3.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]). Intravenous dextrose was administered. A repeat fingerstick glucose measurement was 127 mg per deciliter (7.0 mmol per liter), and the lethargy abated. The patient was brought by EMS personnel to the emergency department of this hospital.
In the emergency department, the patient reported weakness on the left side of her body and persistent headache. She reported that when she had awoken at 1:00 a.m., she was unable to move or speak, was afraid she was going to die, and began screaming for help. She reported no aura, urinary or fecal incontinence, or neck pain. She had recently moved from Puerto Rico and lived in a suburb of Boston. She did not speak English and was marginally housed, sleeping in the living room of a friend’s apartment with her husband. Several people living in the apartment had had cough and fever.
The patient had a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and schizophrenia. Medications included aspirin, glipizide, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, and risperidone. She had no known drug allergies. She drank alcohol occasionally and did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs.
On examination, the temperature was 37.4°C, the blood pressure 114/62 mm Hg, the heart rate 94 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air; the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 30.5. The patient was alert and interactive. She was oriented to person and place but not to time. The cranial-nerve examination was normal. Strength in the left arm and left leg was 4/5, and strength in the right arm and right leg was 5/5. She had difficulty manipulating small objects placed in the left hand. The left arm showed pronator drift and orbiting. Sensation to light touch was intact. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed 2 hours after presentation. Diffusion-weighted images showed a punctate focus of restricted diffusion within the posterior limb of the right internal capsule; no corresponding abnormality was observed on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images (Figure 1A and 1B). A chest radiograph obtained 2.5 hours after presentation showed a nodular focus in the left midlung field.
A test of a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was positive. The results of urine toxicologic screening were normal.","Brief psychosis and small-vessel cerebral infarction, probably related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.",,Case 26-2020: A 60-Year-Old Woman with Altered Mental Status and Weakness on the Left Side,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2004976,nejm
"A 34-year-old man presented to a community hospital in Vancouver, Canada, with a 1-month history of constant diffuse abdominal pain, fatigue, and anorexia associated with a weight loss of 2.7 kg but no fevers or night sweats. He reported constipation but no diarrhea, melena, or hematochezia. His medical history and travel history were unremarkable.
The patient was from India but had lived in Canada since he was 13 years of age. He worked at a family-run business and lived with his wife and his parents. His medications included gabapentin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen with codeine, all of which had been prescribed for his recent pain. He reported that he did not use nicotine-containing products, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs.
On examination, the patient’s temperature was 36.7°C, the blood pressure 117/73 mm Hg, the pulse 99 beats per minute, the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air, and the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute. He appeared thin with conjunctival pallor. The jugular venous pressure was 1 cm above the sternal angle. The cardiac, respiratory, and neurologic examinations were normal. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy. The abdominal examination revealed mild tenderness in the left lower quadrant, with no rebound tenderness, guarding, ascites, masses, or organomegaly. Bowel sounds were normal.
The hemoglobin level was 7.7 g per deciliter, and the hematocrit 25%, with a mean corpuscular volume of 73 fl. The platelet count was 344,000 per cubic millimeter, and the white-cell count 11,300 per cubic millimeter, with 90% polymorphonuclear leukocytes and a normal eosinophil count. The ferritin level was 316 ng per milliliter (normal range, 15 to 300), the iron level 184 μg per deciliter (33 μmol per liter) (normal range, 60 to 150 μg per deciliter [11 to 27 μmol per liter]), the total iron-binding capacity 290 μg per deciliter (52 μmol per liter) (normal range, 250 to 425 μg per deciliter [45 to 76 μmol per liter]), and the transferrin saturation 63% (normal range, 20 to 55). A peripheral-blood smear showed occasional nucleated red cells, polychromasia, basophilic stippling, Pappenheimer bodies, teardrop cells, and microcytosis. The aspartate aminotransferase level was 100 U per liter (normal range, 10 to 38), the alanine aminotransferase level 162 U per liter (normal range, 10 to 80), the γ-glutamyltransferase level 195 U per liter (normal range, 15 to 80), and the alkaline phosphatase level 132 U per liter (normal range, 30 to 135); the bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase levels were normal. No recent blood test results were available for comparison. The results of renal-function tests were normal, as were the levels of electrolytes, thyrotropin, serum vitamin B12, and C-reactive protein; the international normalized ratio; and the activated partial-thromboplastin time. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealed thickening of the rectum and sigmoid colon near the hepatic flexure, with a normal-appearing terminal ileum and no lymphadenopathy.
The patient was admitted to the hospital for further investigation. Upper and lower endoscopy revealed normal-appearing mucosa, with no bleeding or inflammation; random biopsy specimens of the rectum, terminal ileum, duodenum, and stomach were obtained. Ultrasonography of the liver revealed diffuse fatty infiltration. The patient received morphine, which reduced his pain. He was discharged home with pantoprazole at a dose of 40 mg per day; given the presence of microcytic anemia, the presumptive diagnosis was thalassemia, although the results of the hemoglobin electrophoresis were pending. After discharge, the gastric-biopsy specimens showed evidence of Helicobacter pylori infection; despite treatment with lansoprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin, the symptoms did not abate. Examinations of the other biopsy specimens were negative, as was the test for hemoglobinopathy.
During the next 6 weeks, the patient had three subsequent visits to the emergency department for ongoing abdominal pain. He was referred to a gastroenterologist for a capsule endoscopy; the results were normal. He was then readmitted to the hospital; he had lost an additional 11 kg of weight and had a new headache on the right side that had lasted 2 to 3 hours, with associated nausea but no photophobia or neck stiffness. He remained afebrile. An additional workup included serologic testing for hepatitis A, B, and C viruses, testing for syphilis and HIV infection, serum protein electrophoresis, lumbar puncture, blood cultures, urine cultures, chest radiography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and spine, all of which were unremarkable. The patient was seen by a neurologist, a rheumatologist, and an infectious-disease specialist. He was ultimately discharged home with an unclear diagnosis (with his presentation postulated to be related to a viral illness), and outpatient follow-up with a hematologist was planned. He received a prescription for hydromorphone to be used as needed for ongoing abdominal pain.
One week later, the patient returned to the hospital after having a witnessed generalized seizure. Despite treatment with diazepam and phenytoin, he had subsequent recurrent seizures with interictal somnolence that resulted in intubation and transfer to the intensive care unit. He was afebrile on presentation. A neurologic examination did not suggest any focal lesions. CT of the head was unremarkable. Urine drug screening was positive only for opioids, a finding that was consistent with his prescribed medications, and ethanol was not detected in the serum. His blood tests continued to indicate microcytic anemia, and he had a normal C-reactive protein level. His liver-enzyme levels were now normal.
The trachea was extubated on hospital day 2. Examination of a bone marrow–biopsy specimen and bone marrow aspirate showed normal trilineage hematopoiesis with occasional ringed sideroblasts and no evidence of myelodysplasia or a lymphoproliferative disorder. On hospital day 6, a critically elevated serum level of free protoporphyrin was reported (612.4 μg per deciliter [10.84 μmol per liter]) (normal range, 15 to 50 μg per deciliter [0.27 to 0.88 μmol per liter]); this blood test had been ordered to investigate for porphyria.
The elevated serum level of free protoporphyrin, combined with the patient’s abdominal pain, seizures, and laboratory evidence of microcytic anemia, was considered to be indicative of lead poisoning. The blood lead level was markedly elevated, at 94.4 μg per deciliter (4.6 μmol per liter) (normal value, <5 μg per deciliter [0.2 μmol per liter]).
No potential occupational or environmental exposures were identified, and the patient reported no use of herbal supplements or Ayurvedic medications and no use of glazed ceramic cookware. Although the patient had previously reported that he did not use any illicit drugs, his father disclosed that the patient had been using opium. The patient subsequently divulged the details of his substance use. He had begun using opium, which he had obtained from a customer at his business, 2 years earlier. Before the patient was hospitalized, he had been using opium on a daily basis and had spent approximately $2,000 in Canadian dollars (approximately $1,500 in U.S. dollars) per month on opium. He had ingested it orally, with no intravenous use. His withdrawal symptoms had included nausea, sweating, and tremors. He was motivated to stop using opium and to begin opioid-agonist therapy with buprenorphine–naloxone.
A sample of the opium was obtained for analysis; inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of lead, at 23 ppm. In consultation with the local poison control center, and with no residual changes in mental status, the patient received chelation therapy with oral meso 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (succimer) for 18 days. He was discharged home with instructions to take buprenorphine–naloxone (at a dose of 4 mg and 1 mg, respectively) and was referred to community addiction support services.
The patient’s symptoms of abdominal and musculoskeletal pain, lethargy, and anorexia abated rapidly, and at a follow-up visit 6 months later, his blood lead level had dropped to 35.0 μg per deciliter (1.7 μmol per liter). On follow-up more than 1 year later, he remained abstinent from opium with continued treatment with buprenorphine–naloxone, and he reported that he had not had any recurrent seizures since his previous hospitalization for a witnessed generalized seizure.",Lead poisoning.,,Led Astray,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcps1900799,nejm
"A 7-year-old girl who had immigrated to the United States from Central America was evaluated in the asylum clinic of this hospital — where forensic medical evaluations of asylum seekers are performed to document evidence of persecution — because of psychological distress after family separation while in U.S. immigration detention.
Seven months before this evaluation, the patient and her mother fled their village in Central America because of physical and emotional abuse. They traveled by foot, motorcycle, bus, and truck for thousands of kilometers, with limited access to food, water, and other basic resources during their journey. They traveled without legal authorization; on one occasion, they hid in a farmhouse for several days to evade local authorities.
Six months before this evaluation, the patient and her mother crossed the United States–Mexico border. The mother reported that they had been surrounded by border patrol officers and instructed to relinquish personal belongings and remove pieces of clothing; these items were not returned. The patient and her mother were driven to a border detention facility in the Southwest region of the United States and were placed with approximately 40 other women and children in a room that was locked and guarded by male guards. The room had cement floors, a toilet shielded by a partial wall, and a mattress for every four people.
After 2 days of detainment, the patient’s mother was instructed to bathe the child, dress her in an oversized, unmarked uniform, and place her in a line of children approximately 5 to 12 years old. The children were led out of the room without their mothers and transported to a facility in another state. The patient and her mother were not informed of the destination or told when they would be able to communicate. The mother was told that she would be deported and would not see her child again.
Five days later, the patient’s mother was transported to a facility more than 1000 km away from the patient’s new facility. After 15 days of separation, the patient and her mother communicated by telephone for the first time. During the next month, they talked approximately once per week.
The patient described that, while she was in the facility, she was bullied by other children. They called her names, insulted her, and stole a hat that she had made for her mother. A boy hit the patient in the face and loosened a tooth; another child kicked a ball toward her mouth and caused a nosebleed. The patient befriended a girl and cried for days when that girl was transported to another location without notice. When the patient had a fever, cough, and conjunctivitis, she was held in isolation for an unknown amount of time; the symptoms resolved spontaneously. The patient felt uncomfortable with male staff members and requested that female staff members be assigned to care for her; she reported that this request had not been granted.
Four months before this evaluation and approximately 5 weeks after crossing the border, the patient’s mother filed for asylum in the United States. She was released and traveled to New England, at which point she petitioned for the release of the patient. After 2 months of separation, the patient was released and transported to New England to join her mother.
During the evaluation in the asylum clinic, the patient’s mother reported that the girl no longer had interest in activities that she had previously enjoyed. She had performed well in school but now had trouble focusing during class and had become afraid of other children, especially boys. She had begun to have aggressive behavior — such as throwing rocks at people, cursing, and frequently getting into fights with other children — along with food aversions; the patient now ate only soup from a cup and had no interest in foods she had previously enjoyed.
The patient’s mother also reported that the girl had anxiety, which was worse when she was separated from her mother. During these times, the patient had catastrophic thoughts, such as thoughts of her mother dying or being run over by a vehicle. She insisted that her mother walk her to the door of her school every day. At night, she could not fall asleep unless she was holding her mother’s hand, and she had frequent nightmares. The patient scratched and kicked during sleep and would awake suddenly, screaming and crying.
The patient had no history of illness and had met normal developmental milestones. She took no medications and had no known drug allergies. She lived with her mother in a suburban area of New England. In Central America, the patient had lived with her parents and grandparents. Her father drank alcohol and used illicit drugs.
The patient reported that, in Central America, “bad people wanted to kill my mother.” She was aware that her mother had been abducted at gunpoint and held against her will for an extended period. She recalled a burglary of the family’s home. The patient had also witnessed her father hitting her mother. She reported that she had heard her father tell her mother that he wished the mother would die. On multiple occasions, he had locked the patient and her mother inside their home for several days while he drank alcohol or used drugs. The father had used a belt to strike the patient.
The patient was well developed and appropriately dressed. She was alert and cooperative but detached. Speech was spontaneous and fluent in Spanish. Mood and affect were normal initially but became more negative during the interview. She became visibly anxious when discussing her childhood in Central America and her detention in the Southwest.",Post-traumatic stress disorder.,,Case 20-2020: A 7-Year-Old Girl with Severe Psychological Distress after Family Separation,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2002413,nejm
"A 32-day-old male infant was transferred to the emergency department and admitted to this hospital for evaluation of suspected abusive head trauma.
On the evening of admission, the patient’s mother called emergency medical services and reported that the patient had fallen. The mother reported that the infant had been well until that evening, when she placed him on her bed before briefly stepping a short distance away to warm up a bottle of formula in the microwave. She heard a thud and then returned to find that the baby had fallen less than 1 m (2 to 3 ft) from the bed to the hardwood floor, where he was lying face down and crying. She picked him up immediately to console him. After continuing to cry for several minutes, the patient suddenly became quiet; this behavior was worrisome to the mother and prompted her to call for emergency medical assistance. During the phone call, the baby resumed crying. On arrival of emergency medical services personnel several minutes later, the infant appeared well and was bottle-feeding without difficulty; there were no signs of injury. He was transported by ambulance to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation.
At the other hospital, the patient’s mother reported that the baby had not lost consciousness or vomited during the event and was behaving normally. On examination, the patient was alert, regarded the examiner, cried when he was undressed, and calmed when he was swaddled. The vital signs were normal. The head was normocephalic and atraumatic. There were no bruises or subconjunctival hemorrhages, and results of abdominal, musculoskeletal, and neurologic examinations were normal, as was the remainder of the physical examination.
Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed scattered punctate densities in the right and left superior occipital lobes, a density (3 mm in diameter) extending along the left tentorial leaflet, mild prominence of both opercula, and mild diffuse prominence of the extraaxial spaces.
A report of suspected abusive head trauma was filed with the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families, and the patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.
On arrival at this hospital, a history was obtained from the patient’s mother. The patient was born at another hospital after 37 weeks of gestation; labor was induced because of maternal preeclampsia, and the infant was delivered vaginally. At delivery, a nuchal cord was unwrapped from the baby’s neck. He received routine newborn care and was feeding and growing well. Two weeks before the current evaluation, he was seen in the emergency department of the first hospital because of three episodes of vomiting; abdominal ultrasonography performed during that visit did not reveal findings consistent with pyloric stenosis. During the 10 to 14 days before the current evaluation, the patient was fussy. He had a diaper rash, for which his pediatrician prescribed topical nystatin; in addition, his mother was applying a zinc oxide–containing cream to the rash. He took no other medications and had no known allergies. His mother had a history of asthma, post-traumatic stress disorder, and anxiety; she had placed frequent calls to emergency medical services because of concerns about her health but was often reassured by the responding personnel and not transported to a hospital. Both of the patient’s maternal grandparents had a history of substance use disorder, and his maternal grandmother had died of a heroin overdose.
The patient lived with his mother in housing funded by the Department of Mental Health. They were visited each week by a case manager and received social support from an aunt. The patient’s mother was a high school graduate and was certified as an emergency medical technician; she had been in the custody of the Department of Children and Families during adolescence and had a 2-year-old daughter who had been placed with the aunt at the recommendation of the Department of Children and Families because of concerns about the mother’s mental health issues. Although the case involving the daughter was closed, the mother reported that she still had contact with her former social worker, who continued to provide support. The pregnancy with the patient was unplanned and occurred near the beginning of the mother’s relationship with the father of the baby; this relationship was characterized by young age and intimate-partner violence, and the couple separated before the birth of the infant. The mother was the patient’s primary caregiver, although on two occasions (the most recent one occurring 6 days before this evaluation), the baby had spent time with his father.
On examination, the patient was alert and vigorous and appeared well. The temperature was 36.6°C, the pulse 161 beats per minute, the blood pressure 86/50 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 56 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 3.99 kg (18th percentile), the length 53 cm (17th percentile), and the head circumference 35 cm (2nd percentile). There were no exterior signs of facial or scalp trauma, and the anterior fontanelle was soft and flat. An intraoral examination did not reveal lesions; the lingual frenulum was intact. The abdomen was soft, without distention, tenderness, or masses. Examination of the skin revealed scattered skin-colored papules (1 mm in diameter) on the chest and face, a crescent-shaped erythematous patch above the right nipple, a blanching erythematous macule (3 mm in diameter) on the left buttock, erythema of the intergluteal cleft, and a scratch (3 mm by 2 mm) behind the left knee. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and additional imaging studies were obtained.
Susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), performed 16 hours after the head CT, revealed a lobular focus of hemorrhage (15 mm by 2 mm) in the right superior occipital gyrus that was probably chronic and corresponded to the 2-mm punctate density seen on non–contrast-enhanced CT. A similar focus of hemorrhage in the left superior occipital gyrus was also probably chronic. A focus of hemorrhage in the right caudothalamic groove and two foci of hemorrhage or mineralization (3 mm in diameter) in the bilateral choroid plexuses were also seen.",Intraparenchymal and intracranial hemorrhage presumably due to birth trauma.,,Case 5-2020: A 32-Day-Old Male Infant with a Fall,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc1900420,nejm
"A 16-year-old girl was seen in the sports concussion clinic at this hospital because of headache, dizziness, balance problems, fatigue, irritability, and difficulties with sleep and concentration after she had head trauma during a sailboat race.
The patient had been well until 11 days before this evaluation, when she was racing in a regatta and was struck in the head by the boom of another team’s boat. On collision, her team’s boat capsized. The patient was reportedly dazed and confused, but she was assisted back into the boat by her teammates and they continued to sail. Shortly thereafter, the weather became windy and the patient and her teammates were again knocked out of the boat. The patient reportedly lost consciousness for several minutes; it was suspected but not confirmed that she had been hit by the boom of her team’s boat. She was rescued and brought to shore. On arrival of emergency medical services personnel, she was awake and talking but confused. She was transported by ambulance to the emergency department at another hospital. During the ambulance ride, she was agitated and resisted care.
In the emergency department, the patient reported that she felt confused, dizzy, and unsteady and had a headache. The results of a neurologic examination and an examination of the neck were reportedly normal, as were radiographs of the cervical spine. Rest and observation were recommended, and the patient was discharged home in the care of her parents.
Eleven days later, the patient was seen in the sports concussion clinic at this hospital. She did not remember the sailing accident or the subsequent ambulance ride. Since discharge, she had been resting at home with limited activity and stimulation. She had occasional frontotemporal headaches with sharp pain, which she rated at 3 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. She also reported dizziness, balance problems, fatigue, and difficulty sleeping. The patient noted that she had had difficulty concentrating on her summer reading assignment and could not read a full page without losing focus, although she could read less challenging material for 15-to-20-minute intervals. Reading precipitated headaches. She reported that she felt irritable and impatient with having to stay home and that her symptoms decreased with activity.
The patient had a history of several sports-related injuries. When she was 13 years of age, she had a concussion without loss of consciousness after being hit in the head with a paddleboard. After that injury, she was dizzy for several days and had headaches for 3 months. The patient took no medications and had no known allergies. She lived with her parents and brother in a suburban area of New England and was an excellent student. Her brother had attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). There was no family history of headaches, learning disabilities, depression, anxiety, or seizure disorders.
On examination, the patient was alert and answered questions appropriately. On a mental-status examination, orientation, immediate and delayed recall, attention, and language were intact. The neck was not tender and had a full range of motion. Cranial nerves II through XII were normal, and there was no nystagmus. Photophobia was present, and there was pain with upward gaze; the near point of convergence was 15 cm. Both nodding and side-to-side movements of the head caused dizziness. On a Romberg test, the patient swayed mildly when she stood with her feet together and eyes closed. There were mild difficulties with double-leg, single-leg, and tandem stance on a hard surface. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.","Concussion, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, and attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder.",,Case 27-2019: A 16-Year-Old Girl with Head Trauma during a Sailboat Race,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc1900590,nejm
"A 27-year-old woman was evaluated at this hospital because of a suicide attempt.
Approximately 3 months before admission, the patient became homeless and was staying intermittently with friends. Two months before admission, she began to ingest clonazepam daily, and 3 weeks before admission, she began to use intranasal heroin daily. She had depression and anxiety, and 2 days before admission, she expressed that she felt “tired of living this life” and wanted “to end it all.”
On the evening of presentation, the patient reportedly smashed her cell phone on the ground and ate the glass shards as a suicide attempt. Nausea and diffuse abdominal discomfort developed, and she reportedly had an episode vomiting, with the vomit containing 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of blood. Three hours after the ingestion, she presented to the emergency department of this hospital with throat, chest, and abdominal pain. She reported that she had “regret” about the ingestion and wanted “help” with her substance use and suicidality.
The patient reported past sexual trauma but did not provide details; she did not report any previous suicide attempts, homicidal ideation, or hallucinations. A limited review of systems was notable for anorexia, diaphoresis, diarrhea, impaired sleep, fatigue, mood lability, nightmares, and flashbacks. Her psychiatric history included polysubstance use disorder (with the use of intravenous heroin, fentanyl, benzodiazepines, and cocaine), cutting behavior during adolescence, and anxiety and depression. She had never undergone psychiatric treatment or hospitalization. Her medical history included hepatitis C virus infection, obesity, genital herpes simplex virus infection, and a low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion of the cervix; in addition, a motor vehicle collision had led to open reduction and internal fixation involving the left arm. She took no medications and had no known adverse reactions to medications. She worked in a local store and had a small child. She had smoked one and a half packs of cigarettes daily for the past 10 years and was a current smoker. She drank 1 pint of vodka daily and reported no history of withdrawals or blackouts. Multiple relatives, including both of her parents, had a history of substance use disorder.
On examination, the temperature was 36.8°C, the pulse 70 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared disheveled, tearful, and anxious. Abdominal examination revealed mild tenderness on the right side on palpation. On examination by a psychiatrist, she had limited eye contact and mumbling speech, along with poor concentration, depressed mood with a congruent affect, and poor insight and judgment. The complete blood count and levels of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, creatinine, lactate, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and albumin were normal; the aspartate aminotransferase level was 162 U per liter (reference range, 9 to 32), and the alanine aminotransferase level was 52 U per liter (reference range, 7 to 33). Ethanol was not detected in the blood, and human chorionic gonadotropin was not detected in the urine. A urine toxicology screen was positive for opioids and cocaine metabolites. The findings on an electrocardiogram were normal and unchanged from a tracing obtained 10 years earlier.
The results of radiography of the neck, chest, and abdomen were normal, without a visible radiopaque foreign body. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material (Figure 1), revealed gallbladder wall thickening and trace perihepatic fluid. These findings can be seen in patients with acute hepatitis. There was no evidence of pneumoperitoneum or of a radiopaque foreign body.
Intravenous normal saline, morphine sulfate, and piperacillin–tazobactam were administered. The patient was evaluated by the surgery and psychiatry services. Because of concern about the patient’s risk of self-harm, an order that authorized temporary involuntary hospitalization was implemented.
The next evening, the patient reported that while she was trying to get out of a stretcher, she “heard a pop” in her right elbow, which was accompanied by immediate pain without any numbness or tingling. On examination by an orthopedic surgeon, the olecranon process appeared to protrude posteriorly and medially without ecchymosis. The patient was not able to move the arm at the elbow, although range of motion was intact at the shoulder and wrist.
A lateral image of the right elbow showed posterior dislocation of the elbow with impaction of the olecranon process of the ulna into the distal humerus outside the olecranon fossa. An anteroposterior image of the right elbow confirmed dislocation of the elbow with malalignment of the ulnotrochlear and radiocapitellar joints.
After the administration of acetaminophen, ibuprofen, oxycodone, and intravenous morphine, the elbow was manually reduced and a splint was applied. Additional radiographic images were obtained.
Lateral and anteroposterior images of the right elbow obtained after closed reduction and splinting showed normal alignment of the ulnotrochlear and radiocapitellar joints.
During the next 18 hours, the patient remained under observation, with a plan for transfer to an inpatient psychiatric hospital for ongoing care. One hour before transfer, the patient went to the bathroom without her observer and then reported that she could not move her right arm.
A lateral image of the right elbow showed that the splint was in place and showed posterior dislocation of the elbow with impaction of the olecranon process of the ulna into the distal humerus outside the olecranon fossa. An anteroposterior image of the right elbow confirmed dislocation of the elbow with predominant involvement of the radiocapitellar joint. There was irregularity of the radial head and lateral humeral epicondyle that was consistent with a nondisplaced fracture.
Intravenous morphine was administered. The elbow was again reduced, and a circumferential fiberglass cast was placed.
A lateral image of the right elbow obtained after the second closed reduction and casting showed normal alignment and the presence of a cast.
The next afternoon, after the plan for transfer to a psychiatric hospital was shared with the patient, she was found in the bathroom without her observer, where she was banging her left arm against the wall. She reported pain, and oral oxycodone and intramuscular hydromorphone were administered.
A lateral image of the left elbow obtained hours after the second reduction and casting of the right elbow showed posterior dislocation of the left elbow and a fragment from a displaced fracture of the trochlea. There were two screws in the lateral humeral epicondyle from previous open reduction and internal fixation.
Intraarticular nerve block was performed. The left elbow was reduced, and a long-arm circumferential fiberglass cast was placed.",Opioid use disorder and malingering.,,Case 26-2019: A 27-Year-Old Woman with Opioid Use Disorder and Suicidal Ideation,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc1904043,nejm
