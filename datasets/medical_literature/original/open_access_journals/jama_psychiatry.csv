"A young man was referred by his Veterans Affairs (VA) primary care provider to the outpatient mental health clinic due to concerns for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. He served in the military for 4 years, including a 6-month tour in Iraq. While in Iraq he worked as an assault vehicle operator and was involved in frequent foot patrols. He reported numerous traumatic experiences, including frequent receipt of incoming fire, multiple ambushes, and an explosion by an improvised explosive device (IED) that injured several fellow soldiers.

He denied any psychiatric issues prior to his military service, but reported that since returning home “there ain’t a day that goes by that I don’t think about [these experiences].” The thoughts were highly distressing and he had frequent violent nightmares. He reported intense guilt relating to the belief that he should have detected the IED and been able to protect his colleagues. He reported a number of triggers (eg, walking down a city street; driving by a shooting range) that reminded him of his experiences in Iraq and induced panic-like symptoms (eg, fear, anxiety, racing heart, and feeling shaky). He avoided things that reminded him of these events and was reluctant to discuss his history.

He felt numb and withdrawn from others, reported difficulty sleeping, and was always “on guard.” He startled easily and had angry outbursts. The patient was hopeless at times, but denied suicidal thoughts. He reported difficulty concentrating and had significant fluctuations in his weight. He denied mania, psychosis, or medical problems. He reported drinking more than 12 beers 2 to 3 times per week. He denied any other substance abuse history.

The patient was briefly in outpatient treatment while he was still in the military. He was prescribed a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) but did not find it helpful and so he discontinued it. He was referred for psychotherapy but did not keep his appointments.

The patient grew up in the suburb of a small city. Though the patient initially described his childhood as “great,” later data revealed a history of early traumatic experiences.",Posttraumatic stress disorder requiring therapy,Trauma-focused psychotherapy,Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in a Young Adult Military Veteran,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2607490,jama_psychiatry
"A 20-year-old woman was referred by her family physician to a community mental health team in London, United Kingdom. Her mental state had deteriorated progressively over the previous 12 months, following the death of her father. After a period living alone, she had returned to the family home 4 months prior to her presentation and had been noted to be socially withdrawn, preoccupied, and distractible. Her family physician, suspecting a depressive episode, had prescribed citalopram up to a dosage of 40 mg once daily, to no effect. Her family subsequently sought advice from the family physician when the patient was noted to be speaking to herself, expressing concerns about people meaning her harm, and professing the belief that she could hear other peoples’ thoughts.

The patient had been born in Sierra Leone after a complicated delivery and had traveled to the United Kingdom as a child with her family, who were fleeing from a civil war. On arrival in the United Kingdom, her family claimed asylum and moved into a small apartment in a high-rise building in central London. Although there was no reported developmental delay, she had struggled academically at school and was bullied for having overweight. She left school without qualifications at age 16 years and worked as a shop assistant. She left this job about a year prior to her referral to psychiatry after a period of sick leave following the death of her father. She was a nonsmoker, did not drink alcohol, and denied illicit drug use. A paternal relative was reported to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia. There was no comorbid physical illness.

On review, the patient was kempt and had overweight. Eye contact was fleeting, and she presented as anxious, with a degree of psychomotor agitation. Her speech was normal in rate, volume, and tone, although tangential. There was no other evidence of thought disorder. She denied feeling low in mood or suicidal and was objectively euthymic. There was some sleep disturbance, with the patient reporting being fearful to go to sleep owing to persecutory beliefs regarding her neighbors. She reflected that over the preceding few months, she had experienced a sensation of detachment from her immediate environment, as though it was not real, making her world similar to that of a video game. She reported that in the apartment where she had previously been living, she had realized that something was amiss and had become convinced that the door number of her neighbor’s flat, number 6, signified that they meant her harm. She explained this was because 6 was associated with the number of the devil. She reported hearing her neighbors commenting negatively about her appearance. These distressing experiences prompted her to return to her family home, but she continued to hear her neighbors’ voices making derogatory comments about her appearance and began to hear them commenting on her actions and thoughts in the third person as well. On returning home, her paranoia regarding her previous neighbors worsened, resulting in her rarely leaving the house. The volume and frequency of derogatory auditory hallucinations also worsened, and she reported hearing the thoughts of others as well. There was a degree of insight, and although the patient was convinced of the reality of her experiences, she also saw the stress of losing her father as associated with her experiences and was accepting of input from mental health services.",Schizophrenia,Consider the risk of adverse events and which drugs are approved for use,Treatment of First-Episode Schizophrenia in a Young Woman,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2753511,jama_psychiatry
"A 17-year-old boy was referred from the general practitioner to the local psychosis early-detection clinic owing to a drop in functioning and social withdrawal during the previous 6 months. He began college 6 months prior but had found the workload difficult and failed his examinations. He had no family history of mental disorders, denied any current or past use of drugs, and reported no significant medical history. He was well kempt, was quiet during his interview, and provided short answers. He reported that he no longer enjoyed his former interests and could not relate to people at college or to friends, but there were no clear signs of depressive disorders. No formal thought disorders were elicited. He was 80% convinced that random people looked and talked about him when he was out in public but was able to question it. He stated that these people were probably commenting on the way he looked, but he did not believe these individuals meant him harm. He never acted on these thoughts. He also reported a vague feeling of perplexity and derealization. These experiences began when he started college and continued to occur every day for up to an hour at a time, causing significant distress. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM did not reveal any mental disorder.","The designation (not properly a diagnosis) is Clinical High Risk for Psychosis (CHR-P), attenuated psychotic symptoms subgroup, determined using the Comprehensive Assessment of At-risk Mental States (CAARMS).

"A middle-aged woman was referred to an outpatient mental health clinic for symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) following a recent hospitalization. Her OCD symptoms consisted of concerns about dirt or germs and fears that she or others would get sick because of spreading these contaminants. She had extensive rituals involving washing her hands repeatedly and cleaning household items. She reported, “I wash everything anyone else touches…I hardly let anyone into our home, and if I do, I wash down furniture and often have to wash the floors.” She avoided handling groceries, mail, and money and would not visit with family members owing to concerns that they were contaminated.

She had experienced OCD symptoms since age 10 years but did not formally receive a diagnosis until 10 years later. Treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) resulted in little benefit even at maximum doses (eg, 400 mg of fluvoxamine daily, 200 mg of sertraline daily). A trial of clomipramine up to 250 mg daily also failed to reduce her OCD symptoms. Augmentation trials of antipsychotic medications, including risperidone, olanzapine, and aripiprazole, were either ineffective or intolerable.

In addition to OCD, she experienced periods of depression but denied any history of mania, psychosis, trauma, or substance abuse. She reported mild hoarding symptoms but denied symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder, trichotillomania, excoriation disorder, or an eating disorder. She reported a history of motor and phonic tics including eye blinking and blurting out words. Her medical history included hypothyroidism managed with thyroid hormone supplementation and fibromyalgia.",Medication-refractory OCD requiring exposure and response prevention therapy,Referral for outpatient exposure and response prevention therapy,A Case of Severe Intractable Contamination-Based Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2696593,jama_psychiatry
"A 29-year old man who is married and an employed Army veteran presented with headache from a mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) diagnosed before his Army discharge. He came to a Veterans Affairs hospital requesting buprenorphine/naloxone and complained of marital problems and job absenteeism. His TBI occurred when a roadside bomb overturned his supply truck in Afghanistan. He lost consciousness during the bombing and awoke with severe head and neck pain but no radiological brain, spine, or skull damage or focal neurological signs. He was given 20 oral morphine (5 mg) tablets and consumed them in 4 days rather than the intended 2 weeks. After finishing the morphine, he mitigated his pain with alcohol and ibuprofen (400-800 mg daily).

His opioid and ibuprofen use for TBI headaches escalated during and after his time in the military despite repeated efforts to stop by using clonidine, which relieved his withdrawal symptoms, although a rapid clonidine with naltrexone detoxification failed. After consuming a 6-week supply of morphine (5 mg) from his family physician in 3 weeks, he started receiving morphine from multiple pain physicians for about a year and buying prescription opioids from a friend. When the prescription opioids became too expensive, he started using heroin intravenously. After using heroin for about a year, he survived a respiratory arrest from overdosing with heroin mixed with fentanyl. This almost fatal overdose and persistent headaches scared him into going to a Veterans Affairs hospital, wanting buprenorphine/naloxone. His headaches had gotten worse since his injury 3 years ago, but new radiologic and neurologic examinations showed no abnormalities.",Opioid use disorder and mild TBI,Prescribe buprenorphine at 16 mg daily,Opioid Use Disorder After Self-medicating Pain From Traumatic Brain Injury,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2678575,jama_psychiatry
"A 4-year-old boy was referred to the child psychiatry clinic for management of tantrums with aggression and self-injurious behavior. Tantrums were unpredictable and often resulted in severe head-butting. His parents also reported atypical social and language development, disrupted sleep, and persistent impulsivity with attempts to elope.

The patient had a complex medical history that was marked by prematurity at 32 weeks, slow postnatal growth, and severe gastroesophageal reflux. Genetic testing following an episode of hypoglycemia revealed microdeletion of the 16p11.2 region of chromosome 16. His pediatrician documented a normal neurological examination without dysmorphology or congenital anomalies.

A developmental evaluation revealed delays in motor function and language development notable by age 2 years. He attended a 0 to 3 program with intensive speech therapy and then moved to a self-contained preschool classroom with a 1:1 staff-to-student ratio. He received school-based speech, occupational, and physical therapies. Testing results revealed clinically significant scores on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. Cognitive testing results showed that his IQ was below average but was likely an underestimate due to noncompliance. The parents stated that he played repetitively, lining up toy cars and spinning their wheels. He did not seek or give comfort to others when distressed. He had tactile hypersensitivity but pain hyposensitivity, flicked light switches repetitively, and mouthed objects.

In the office, the patient showed a minimal response to clinicians’ social overtures and poor eye contact. He replayed videos on a smartphone while laughing, spinning around, and flapping his hands. He did not respond to prompts for joint engagement and no imaginative play was observed. When the videos stopped, he repeatedly climbed onto chairs and jumped off. As clinicians attempted to redirect him, he became very agitated and his mother intervened physically to protect him from self-injury.","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (associated with chromosome 16p11.2 deletion syndrome, level 3 severity, with accompanying intellectual and language impairment) and global developmental delay","Referral to a behavioral intervention program plus pharmacotherapy with aripiprazole for irritability, agitation, and self-injury",Evaluation and Management of Self-injury in a Child With a Rare Genomic Variant,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2675369,jama_psychiatry
