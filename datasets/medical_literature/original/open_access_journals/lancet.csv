"In March, 2014, a 19-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, and prodromal nonspecific visual symptoms followed by transient loss of consciousness lasting a few minutes. Her parents reported spontaneously resolving generalised tonic–clonic convulsions. She had no medical history and denied substance abuse. She had ongoing metrorrhagia 3 weeks after regular menses and denied sexual activity. On examination she had increased body habitus (body-mass index 32), temperature 38·0°C, blood pressure 155/95 mm Hg, and heart rate 104 beats per min. She had bilateral leg oedema and a globular abdomen without tenderness or any masses to palpation. Neurological examination and fundoscopy were normal. She had two more seizures followed by postictal drowsiness in the department, so we did brain imaging.
Head CT showed a cystic lesion in the third ventricle with upstream ventriculomegaly, but postictal electroencephalography was normal. Brain MRI showed an arachnoid cyst of the third ventricle and a hypothalamic hamartoma, with cortical and subcortical T2-hyperintensities (appendix). Seizures were controlled with levetiracetam. Blood tests were unremarkable, apart from raised β-human chorionic gonadotropin concentrations (16 140 IU/L; normal <10 IU/L). A tumour marker panel showed raised α-fetoprotein (43·5 kU/L; <5 kU/L) and CA-125 (131 kU/L; <35 kU/L) further raising suspicion of an ovarian germ cell tumour. The patient declined gynaecological examination. Abdominal ultrasound showed a discretely enlarged uterus. The ovaries could not be visualised because of obesity, so we planned an abdominal-pelvic MRI. Repeat β-HCG 24 h later showed a striking drop to 2407 IU/L. Although she continued to deny previous sexual intercourse we suspected a recent delivery and were worried about a hidden live newborn baby.",Denial of pregnancy,,Seizures and metrorrhagia: a case of denied pregnancy,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673615600320?via%3Dihub,lancet
"In June, 2012, a 43-year-old Chinese woman came to our clinic with dysphoria, insomnia, and fear of heights. She had no history of mental health problems. The patient had grade 1 L4–L5 spondylolisthesis with lumbar fusion in 2011. Her daughter had died from leukaemia 3 years earlier. The patient was diagnosed with long-term grief, and paroxetine was started. During the next few months she developed panic attacks. When startled by noise, she had painful muscle spasms causing her to momentarily freeze. After titration of antidepressant, her mood improved but panic attacks persisted. In January, 2013, slurred speech, facial asymmetry, and increasing difficulty in writing and walking were noted. She had had eight falls in 2 months and two motor vehicle accidents because she could not press the brake. She subsequently required walking aids because of increasing stiffness and worsening fear of falling. Her gait was stiff on neurological assessment. There was severe lumbar hyperlordosis, axial stiffness, and rigidity. Smooth eye pursuit showed occasional saccadic intrusions in all directions. Arm and leg power was full with normal tone and reflexes. Glabellar tap resulted in elicitation of the sternocleidomastoideus tendon reflex bilaterally. Results were normal for full blood count, electrolytes, thyroid function, fasting glucose, anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, antibodies to cardiolipin, and extractable nuclear antigens. Antiglutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 65 antibodies were 230 U/mL (normal: <0·9 U/mL). Lumbar puncture was attempted twice under fluoroscopic guidance but failed. Electromyography of paraspinal muscles showed continuous motor unit activity at rest. Blink reflex testing showed generalisation with consistent spread to the sternocleidomastoid muscles. Electroencephalography and brain magnetic resonance imaging were normal.",Stiff person syndrome,,Stiff person syndrome masquerading as panic attacks,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673614601276?via%3Dihub,lancet
"In July, 2011, a 52-year-old woman presented to our psychiatric outpatient clinic in The Hague with a life-long history of seeing people's faces change into dragon-like faces and hallucinating similar faces many times a day. She could perceive and recognise actual faces, but after several minutes they turned black, grew long, pointy ears and a protruding snout, and displayed a reptiloid skin and huge eyes in bright yellow, green, blue, or red. She saw similar dragon-like faces drifting towards her many times a day from the walls, electrical sockets, or the computer screen, in both the presence and absence of face-like patterns, and at night she saw many dragon-like faces in the dark.

During her childhood the faces had not bothered her, but in early adolescence they became more prominent and she realised that this was not how other people saw each other's faces. She felt isolated, became depressed, and abused alcohol for many years, but managed to graduate from secondary school, get married, have a daughter, and become a school administrator. Her difficulty sustaining stable perception of other people's faces led to communication problems and recurrent conflicts forcing her to change jobs often, but she sought professional help only after further deterioration of her symptoms. A local psychiatrist prescribed citalopram and quetiapine with no improvement. In desperation she searched the internet for experts in her condition and emailed Prof Oliver Sacks, who referred her to our team in The Netherlands.

Her medical history consisted of birth with a caul, recurrent non-migrainous headaches, urinary tract infections, sensed presence, passage hallucinations (seeing movement from the corner of the eye), and occasional zoopsia (seeing large ants crawling over her hands). Apart from the hallucinations and a mildly depressed mood, psychiatric assessment showed no other abnormalities. Our patient had full insight into the hallucinatory nature of her perceptions, and explained them in terms of a “brain disorder”, having previously interpreted them in metaphysical terms as a consequence of being born with a caul. Neurological examination, blood tests, and electroencephalogram (EEG) were normal, and MRI brain showed only a few white-matter abnormalities near the lentiform nucleus and in the semioval centre.",Proosopometamorphopsia,,Prosopometamorphopsia and facial hallucinations,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673614616901?via%3Dihub,lancet
"A 48-year-old woman presented to our psychiatric emergency room with panic attacks. Her last attack, with anxiety and restlessness, had occurred 2 h before presentation. On arrival she denied somatic symptoms and asked for alternative treatment options to the anxiolytic drug opipramol, which had been prescribed by her general practitioner. A psychiatrist had confirmed the diagnosis of panic attacks and recommended an increase in dosage 1 week before presentation.

Her panic attacks began 5 weeks previously, after surgery for right ankle fracture. Her right ankle was immobilised in a boot cast, and she was having 40 mg subcutaneous enoxaparin daily as thromboprophylaxis. The panic attacks occurred about twice per week at night, characterised by waking from sleep with intense restlessness, generalised anxiety, perception of threat, dizziness, and sweating. She also reported irritable mood, spontaneous weeping, inability to focus, and a mild but permanent restlessness. Psychological stress factors were recent self-employment and her mother's terminal illness. Her psychiatric history consisted of one episode of post-partum depression 12 years earlier, with no history of panic attacks or anxiety disorders.

None of the panic attacks was accompanied by dyspnoea, chest pain, cough, or haemoptysis. Noting the time association between the onset of attacks and the patient's ankle fracture, the psychiatrist on call took a detailed history, and noticed that the last attack was preceded by shortness of breath and pallor on standing, with intense restlessness and anxiety. Considering pulmonary embolus as a likely cause of these symptoms, he transferred the patient to the emergency department.

On admission she had no dyspnoea or chest pain. Blood pressure was normal, but the initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia (105 bpm), and a prolonged QT interval. D-dimer was raised (4·5 μg/mL FEU) and troponin I was positive. Contrast-enhanced CT scan showed extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli, with right ventricular dilatation and interventricular septal bowing, confirming the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Right ventricular dysfunction was shown on transthoracic echocardiography, with paradoxical movement of the ventricular septum.",Pulmonary embolism,,A 48-year-old woman with panic attacks,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673614608825?via%3Dihub,lancet
