"A 36-year-old woman, presented with apathy and food refusal. The patient is described by her family as highly emotional and sensitive. The episode started 2 months prior, with rapidly progressive tendencies towards isolation, irritability, and increased religious concerns. The symptoms progressed into statements of hopelessness and self-depreciation, along with a refusal to eat. As the symptoms progressed, the family noticed a marked weight loss of 15 kg per month (15% of initial weight) as well as episodes of vomiting resistant to symptomatic treatment. The initial clinical evaluation revealed signs of extracellular dehydration, a BMI of 18 kg/m2, and a total functional impotence. The psychiatric examination revealed an alert, yet apathetic patient who remained in bed, had difficulty with social interactions, emotional numbness, irritability, and anxiety. She expressed delusional thoughts of hopelessness, punishment, and suicidal ideation.

The patient was admitted to a psychiatric department, and upon the reintroduction of oral nutrition, she reported abdominal pain, diarrhoea, tachypnoea, along with low oxygen levels. Biochemical analysis showed elevated blood sugar levels, low potassium, phosphate, and magnesium levels. Inappropriate refeeding syndrome (IRS) was diagnosed, and the patient was transferred to an intensive care unit for 4 days, where she received parenteral nutrition and vitamin supplementation (Vit B1, Vit B9, Vit D, and Vit E). The patient was then readmitted to the psychiatry department.",Major depression with psychotic and melancholic features,,Thiamine Deficiency Neuropathy in a Patient with Malnutrition due to Melancholic Depression,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10942818/,case_reports_in_psychiatry
"A black male in his early 20s with a remote history of depression as an adolescent and current cannabis use presented following an assault while incarcerated. He was found unconscious with mental status changes and brought to the hospital. Initial examination and work-up revealed right-sided periorbital edema and ecchymosis. The patient was arousable to noxious stimuli but would quickly return to sleep and was not interactive during multiple examination attempts. The emergency department staff believed there was a volitional component to his lack of participation in the exam, as he would push away from providers as they examined him or lie unresponsive. At one point, the patient was able to ambulate briefly while in the emergency department (although he ran into several objects) and tolerated an oral intake challenge with juice. Over the course of 5 days, the patient was returned to the emergency department by the facility four more times due to concerns that his mental status was not improving. The facility reported the patient was unable to attend to his ADLs. He was seen to be withdrawn, not eating or drinking, and toileting on himself or the floor. Additionally, guards (as he was incarcerated for part of his hospital admission) reported that he would occasionally speak to family members and staff. However, when he was offered paperwork to sign himself out of jail with an ankle monitor, he only gazed at the officer without speaking.

Urine toxicology was positive for THC and a negative blood alcohol level. He was found to have ketones consistent with starvation ketosis. Lumbar puncture revealed CSF cell count with six total nucleated cells present, <2,000 RBC, 54 mg/dL glucose, and 39 mg/dL protein. Meningitis/encephalitis panel for 14 common viral and bacterial pathogens and antibody testing for West Nile Virus was negative. CT of the head showed no fractures of the face/vertebra and was negative for other acute findings. EEG was read as consistent with a normal drowsy state. MRI of the brain, both with and without contrast, showed a cerebellar developmental venous anomaly but no acute findings. A neurology consult was obtained. His neurologic exam was noted to be variable, with poor participation despite repeated prompting, making full examination difficult. He responded to pain equally in all extremities, demonstrated no abnormal movements, had 2+ reflexes symmetrically, and normal pupillary response. Neurology ultimately felt that his LP, MRI, and EEG were unremarkable, and his symptomatology could be explained by postconcussive symptoms.

Once the patient was admitted, he was initially treated with a trial of Modafinil for suspected postconcussive syndrome, to which there was no response. On Day 6 of his hospitalization, when the psychiatric consultation service reconsidered his disordered behavior, psychomotor retardation, and speech with consideration for the presence of catatonia, the question of “volitional” inactivity took on a new meaning. There were numerous catatonia signs present to variable degrees: mutism, decreased oral intake, negativism, withdrawal, and decreased spontaneous movement. No automatic obedience, ambitendency, or rigidity was appreciated.

"In October 2023, a 24-year-old unemployed male presented to the Antalya Ataturk State Hospital outpatient substance addiction treatment clinic for IV BN misuse. He was suffering from pain and restlessness secondary to cessation of BN. In the last 3 months, when he reduced or ceased BN, symptoms, such as restlessness, lacrimation, back and extremity pain, cramps, and insomnia, started to appear within hours. He felt dysphoric and exhausted when he did not use BN. Due to escalating BN use, he has begun to suspect dependency on the medication. The patient had no history of any medical illness in the past.

On the mental status examination, the patient appeared to be tense. Her speech was normal. He was dysphoric. Psychomotor activity was increased, consistent with opiate withdrawal. The content of his thoughts was dominated by an inability to move away from substance use and pessimistic thoughts associated with it. He had no signs of delusion or hallucinations. His attention was prone to be easily distracted.

Throughout his adolescence, there were no symptoms suggestive of borderline personality traits or conduct disorder. His substance use history began at the age of 15 with experimenting with marijuana, introduced by friends out of curiosity. He described feeling euphoria and numbness, using one joint 2–3 times a week. At 18, witnessing someone using heroin in a social setting led him to try it. He had smoked heroin it for a month. Switching to IV use after a friend claimed it provided a better “high,” he continued with 1–2 g of IV heroin daily for the next 5 years (except in his mandatory military service period at 19 for 6 months). He also occasionally used crack cocaine (2 or 3 times a week) in combination with heroin. Infrequently, he encountered and used methamphetamine less than once a month.

About 14 months ago, he was referred to an outpatient substance addiction treatment clinic in another city. An oral BN treatment was initiated at 8 mg daily (2 mg, 4 times a day). After using one or two tablets, he later transitioned to IV use following a friend's suggestion. While he initially described a sense of relaxation and elevation similar to heroin use, recent injections have been solely to alleviate withdrawal symptoms—especially pain. He started with a single IV usage of 2 mg. Over the past 3–4 months, his IV BN use reached 12–16 mg daily with a frequency of four to five injections per day due to tolerance. To mitigate withdrawal symptoms, such as pain, fatigue, restlessness, hot flashes, and insomnia, when using less or abstaining from BN, he started using pregabaline 6 months ago. Subsequently, there was an increase in pregabalin misuse, reaching 3,000 mg daily during this period when he ceased BN use. Within the last month prior to admission, he had not used any pregabaline. Due to conflicts in the marriage and financial difficulties, he separated from his wife. For the past 5 months, he has been living with his parents.",Opioid use disorder,,Guanfacine Treatment in a Patient with Intravenous Buprenorphine/Naloxone Misuse,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10817805/,case_reports_in_psychiatry
"A 12-year-old male with no specific birth or medical history became concerned about lower abdominal distention and began reducing his food intake 3 months prior to consultation. He exercised obsessively according to his food intake. Although he was considerably losing weight, he commented that his belly was fat and did not want it to get any fatter. Body image disturbances and anxiety regarding being overweight were observed. During his initial consultation, he was very lean, with a body mass index (BMI) of 11.5 kg/m2. He also had sinus bradycardia with a heart rate of approximately 40 beats/min. We attempted to improve his weight with enteral nutritional supplements while identifying underlying diseases by head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and abdominal ultrasound. However, he became disoriented and was emergently hospitalized 7 days after his first visit. On admission, he was 145 cm tall, weighed 20.9 kg (BMI: 9.9 kg/m2), and presented with impaired consciousness with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) E3V4M6, bradycardia with a heart rate of about 40 beats/min, and slow breathing with a respiratory rate of about 10 cycles/min. Blood gas analysis and blood test revealed hypercapnia, hypoglycemia, and elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and transaminases. His movements were slow but not paralytic and his cranial nerves were normal.

"Mr. A, a 66-year-old Caucasian male, recently unemployed, without prior psychiatric history but with a past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and renal calculi. In the 6 days prior to admission, the patient exhibited notable behavioral changes, including nihilistic comments and explicit thoughts of self-harm that were accompanied by poor sleep, depressive mood, and nonspecific visual hallucinations. He was brought into the emergency department for these thoughts and depressed mood he was incidentally found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. He was admitted to the medical floor for isolation.

While on the medical floor, initial workup included a negative urine drug screening and an unremarkable cranial CT scan. EEG was also negative. The patient met the criteria for MDD with psychotic features. Evaluation at this time was remarkable for marked personal hygiene neglect, social withdrawal, sadness of mood, diminished interest in almost all activities, anhedonia, ideas of worthlessness, hopelessness, and guilt. He also endorsed poor sleep and no appetite despite refusing to eat since being admitted to the hospital. Patient also endorsed experiencing some anxiety secondary to his nihilism which presented as a belief that he was already dead and that his insides were poisonous to others. This belief was so strong that the patient was afraid to urinate or defecate thinking he would kill the entire hospital by doing so. Once cleared from COVID-19, he was transferred to the inpatient psychiatric floor.",Cotard syndrome,,Psychotropic Management in Cotard Syndrome: Case Reports Supporting Dual Medication Management,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11022521/,case_reports_in_psychiatry

He was initially assessed with concerns for poor sleep, food refusal, depression, and delusions that began 10 days prior to presenting to the hospital. Initial workup included a CT Head, MRI head with/without contrast, EEG, CT angiogram, and urine drug screening that did not yield any significant findings. Collateral information detailed a marked deterioration of his IADLs and ADLs over the weeks leading to admission.

"The case concerns the treatment of a female refugee from East Africa, who was referred by the mental health emergency service. At the time of referral, she was 28 years old and a single mother to a 5-year-old child. She had a residency permit but no permanent housing and was unemployed.

At intake the patient reported the following symptoms according to DSM-5: daily intrusive memories and nightmares, auditory hallucinations, episodes of dissociation with flashbacks, and intense and prolonged psychological distress and physiological reactions to internal and external triggers (intrusion cluster); avoiding distressing memories, thoughts and feelings and avoiding places and people that remind her of the past (avoidance cluster); strong negative beliefs about herself, others and the world, strong self-blame, persistent negative feelings like guilt, shame, horror, and fear, inability to experience positive emotions, diminished interest in activities she used to enjoy and a feelings of detachment and estrangement from others (negative alterations in cognitions and mood), excessive irritability and angry outbursts, constant hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, sleep, and concentration problems (alterations in arousal and reactivity); persistent sense of unreality and detachment of herself and her surroundings, as well as a depressed mood and suicidal thoughts.

The patient grew up as an only child in the east of Africa, living with her mother until the age of 8, when she witnessed her mother die in a traffic accident. After her mother's death, she was sent to a foster family, where she was neglected, mistreated, and sexually abused by her foster father. At the age of 12, she witnessed the torturing, raping, and killing of her aunt by rebels. Four years later, she herself fell victim to a rebel army, being held hostage and subjected to cruel physical and sexual violence for several years. Fleeing the rebel war, she found herself pregnant after a group rape and had to leave her first child behind in a refugee camp when she was again abducted to fight for rebels. She managed to escape the battlefront by hiding in a truck filled with corpses. At the age of 20, she arrived in the Netherlands, misled by a human trafficker who forced her to work in prostitution for 2 years, during which she endured and witnessed physical and sexual abuse, illegal abortions, and being drugged. Shortly after her escape from the trafficker, the patient became pregnant again and gave birth to a second child that she raised on her own.

"M. is a 20-year-old single patient with no prior medical, surgical, or psychiatric history, no substance use, and no family health history besides a diabetic mother (no epilepsy, psychotic disorder nor cerebral vascular abnormalities). He was transferred to the psychiatric emergency room for a recent behavioral change.

One week prior to his admission, while traveling to his new workplace, which is 300 km from his home. The patient got off the bus he was traveling in, halfway through his trip and wandered aimlessly in an unfamiliar city. After several days of wandering and begging, the patient was able to reach his destination with the help of other Samaritans.

Upon arrival at his workplace, the patient was in a state of neglect, expressing delusional thoughts and behaving in a bizarre manner. He was therefore taken to the psychiatric emergency room for treatment.

During his transfer, the patient presented a clonic seizure managed by the paramedical team in charge of the transfer.

In the initial psychiatric examination, the patient was conscious, neglecting his body care, and expressing persecutory remarks with an interpretative mechanism. Those thoughts were experienced with a low affective charge. The patient also presented a disorganization syndrome made of impenetrability of the motives of his bizarre behaviors and of an ambivalence.

"Adah is a 35-year-old single woman who was adopted as an infant. She has a high school education and attended some college classes. Adah was recently bereaved by the loss of her beloved adopting mother to cancer. At age 7, she was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, a genetic disorder causing progressive vision impairment, which has hindered her independence. Adah has a history of a dysfunctional, violent, long-term relationship with an abusive man. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, she has experienced further isolation due to social distancing restrictions and developed contamination fears and compulsive cleaning rituals. She is unemployed and financially dependent on social security benefits and her father's support. Adah's father initiated contact, expressing concern about her confabulating fantasies that seemed indistinguishable from reality, causing turmoil among family members.
Adah is a likable but avoidant woman who oversleeps and overeats. She has a lifelong habit of vivid daydreaming, often involving Disney characters, which provides an escape from her emotional and visual darkness. Despite acknowledging her tendency to “sugar-coat” her problems, Adah showed reluctance to explore her inappropriate fantasies or other sources of distress, such as PTSD, visual impairment, and social isolation.

"A 65-year-old man with a past medical history of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) was brought to the emergency department by his daughter after exhibiting paranoid and bizarre behavior for 6 weeks, culminating in the patient attempting to overdose on his medications that morning. When the patient informed his daughter of his suicide attempt (SA), she brought him to the hospital for further evaluation. The patient reported taking 10 pills of 50 mg trazodone and 10 pills of 10 mg paroxetine in an effort to kill himself.

Per the patient, he had been experiencing escalating depression and suicidal ideation (SI) for 2 months prior to this presentation. The patient associated his depression with extreme distress due to rosacea affecting his appearance as well as concern about the air quality and mold in his house. The patient reports waking up frequently in the middle of the night due to concerns of his rosacea. Notably, 2 days prior, the patient presented at a different emergency department for anxiety and depression without SI, and was discharged without admission. Since that time the patient's depression had escalated into SI.

Four weeks prior to presentation, the patient attempted to commit suicide and was hospitalized at an outside psychiatric facility for 1 week. The patient reportedly stepped in front of and was hit by a moving vehicle going 40 mph. At that time, the patient sustained a small subdural hematoma with no other medical complications. The patient was discharged on clonazepam 0.5 mg daily, trazodone 50 mg nightly, and escitalopram 10 mg daily. Notably, the patient was not prescribed an antipsychotic during or after this hospitalization as no symptoms were identified as psychotic in nature.

Per the patient's daughter, the patient had begun to act bizarrely for the past 6 months. This included paranoia that he could see mold and dust mites in the bathroom and for this reason refused to touch anything in the house. The patient was also concerned that people were hacking his cellphone and that the police would arrest him for a minor car accident he was in. The patient's daughter also reported that the patient had not been eating nor sleeping, and had new difficulty completing ADLs including showering, taking medications, and eating. Additionally, the patient was concerned that his memory had been declining due to issues with attention and word finding.

The patient has experienced issues with anxiety and insomnia since he retired 5 years ago, but had not received treatment until his hospitalization. He denied issues with depression until 2 months prior.

Upon presentation, the patient was found to be medically stable, alert, and oriented ×4, with a linear thought process and depressed affect congruent with his mood. The patient was cooperative with conversation and agreed to be admitted voluntarily into inpatient psychiatric care.

"Index patient, a 16 years old adolescent boy, belonging to Hindu nuclear family from a lower socioeconomic strata, hailing from rural Bihar was admitted in the inpatient Department of Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi. The adolescent was maintaining well and would go to school regularly until about four months ago when, one day his cousin brother who was around one year older than him passed away by drowning in a river nearby his village, where he had gone to take bath. The adolescent was extremely shocked and traumatized when he came to know about this incident. He shared a close emotional bond with his cousin and would spend most of his time at school as well as home with his cousin brother. According to the adolescent, his deceased brother was like a father figure for him, who would always standby him in his good and bad times and would always save him from bullies in school.

The dead body of deceased brother was found two days later and the patient had a glimpse of the body, which left him completely shattered. The family members further observed a change in his behaviour; he would remain upset, stay alone, and would not talk to anybody in the following days.

The adolescent reportedly would have difficulty falling sleep and would stay awake and keep thinking about his deceased brother. When he would fall asleep, he would have nightmares causing him to wake up in a fearful state.

The adolescent resumed his schooling after a week and took the bus to his school. However, the family members received complaints about his behaviour as he would stay alone, not talk to anybody, and would not respond to his teachers either. Within few days, the adolescent experienced the first episode of dissociative amnesia, when one day he left his class without informing anyone and reached his aunt's place nearby his school. He would not speak to his aunt for hours. His parents were called and the patient was taken home. Later, upon inquiry, he could not recall anything about this journey to his aunt's place.

The adolescent experienced the second episode of dissociation, two days after this incident, the adolescent was studying inside his room, when his mother called him for some work, he was not present in the room and was not present around the home either. Hours after this, the family members received a call from a person who informed them about the adolescent. When the family members found him, he again reported being unable to recall the incident and further complained of dizziness and headache. He would also refuse to go to school and state that he cannot concentrate on his studies and that the image of deceased brother comes into his mind.

The adolescent had similar episodes 2-3 times in the week, whereby he would walk alone for distance of 1-2 kms and then suddenly ask people nearby about his own whereabouts. In one such incident, it was reported that the adolescent was walking with the mother to a market nearby. The mother noticed that after sometime, the adolescent walked by himself and did not respond to the mother and would not speak to anybody. His mother kept following him for 2-3 kms and suddenly the adolescent stopped and started asking the mother how he reached here or what are they doing here.

The family members were concerned about the deteriorating state of the patient. Eventually, they took him to a faith healer, who saw him and told them that he is being targeted by some evil spirit and asked them to perform rituals and did some religious spells. This further triggered a sense of fear in the adolescent, as he would say he is scared that something might happen to him.

In the following days, condition worsened as he would run away from home almost 3-4 times in a day without any recall. He also started having episodes where he would fall and lie down on the ground without any response and have jerky movements characterized by head shaking without any symptom of up rolling of eyes or tongue biting with his eyes tightly closed, that would last for a minute and occur every day. According to the mother, in one such incident, the adolescent had gone to take a bath by himself in the bathroom. After 3-4 minutes, the mother suddenly heard the adolescent screamed “mummy.” The mother tried to open the door but it was latched from inside. When, the adolescent's younger brother tried to peep in through the window, it was seen that the adolescent was lying still on the floor of the bathroom. They got inside and tried to wake him up, by calling him out loudly and by sprinkling water, but the adolescent did not respond in any manner and remained still. After 4-5 minutes, he got up and could recall anything about the incident. He again started asking the mother about the incident.

Eventually, family members brought him to outpatient department (OPD) of Central Institute of Psychiatry (CIP), and he was admitted eventually in the inpatient ward. His persistent and pervasive mood was irritable. His role functioning was impaired and personal care was intact.

Index child was kempt, tidy, and in touch with surroundings. He was maintaining eye contact, rapport was established; speech was soft, relevant, coherent, and goal directed with normal reaction time and decreased productivity. He had adequate level of attention and concentration. Cognitive functions were intact. His affect was dysphoric, communicable, and appropriate.

Hopelessness, pessimistic view towards future was present in thought content, and no abnormality was detected in perception. His social judgment was impaired with grade II insight.

"The patient is a 14-year-old Caucasian male, domiciled at home with his parents, 21-year-old brother, and 19-year-old sister, attending 9th grade in regular classes with para, with no known past medical history and a past psychiatric history of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) which had been recently diagnosed by his neurologist, who was brought by his parents to the psychiatric emergency room for evaluation of bizarre behavior.

During the patient's walk toward the evaluation room, he was noted to be talking to himself. Upon evaluation, the patient was in no acute distress, awake, alert, and oriented to self, place, and time, appropriately groomed, calm, and evasive with the evaluation. The patient appeared anxious and sat with his arms crossed throughout the evaluation. His affect was flat. The patient was minimally verbal throughout the evaluation, often trying to answer questions with thumbs up or down. He had a concrete thought process and exhibited poverty of thought and thought blocking, often taking several minutes before responding to a question. When asked about his favorite subject in school, he stated “anything” and had the same response for hobbies, interests, and plans for the future. When asked about the reason for the patient's presentation, he stated “For safety.” When pushed further, he stated “Because I have” and then stopped talking and refused to answer despite encouragement. The patient reported he sleeps roughly 7 hours per night, and when asked for the time, he stated from 8 pm to 6 am, and when asked to calculate the number of hours again, he stated “13,” indicating difficulty with attention and simple mathematics at a level below expected for his age. The patient denied any emotional, verbal, physical, or sexual abuse. He denied auditory and visual hallucinations although at times appeared to be responding to internal stimuli, speaking to himself. The patient denied suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, intent, or plan. He denied using nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and illicit drugs.

A collateral history was obtained from the patient's mother, who accompanied the patient to the hospital. She stated that the patient hit all developmental milestones on time with no difficulty. The reported patient used to be “a normal, kinda quiet” child. She reported that he was attending a charter school with no complaints, and when the COVID-19 pandemic started, he had to do school remotely from home. During that time, his mother noticed that the patient had become “germaphobic,” washing repeatedly and refusing to leave without a mask despite encouragement when restrictions were being lifted. She reported that he would repeatedly wash his hands multiple times throughout the day, stating that he would spend close to one hour daily washing his hands. He returned to his original school after COVID-19 and was noted to be more shy, less social, and less interactive than he had been before the pandemic. The patient then transitioned into another school and was noted to continue behaving differently than he had prior to the pandemic. His mother reported that the patient would only stand in a corner, adamantly refusing to engage and avoiding crowds. She reported that the school offered an individualized education program (IEP) and a para; the IEP was refused, and the para was accepted despite the patient's resistance. The mother reported that in September of 2022, the patient lost a relative whom the patient was very close with very unexpectedly, unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic. She reported that since then, the patient had been declining in functioning. He had become almost nonverbal even with his long-time friends. He was noted to get up and dance in the corner of the classroom in the middle of class last week. The patient had also started self-urinating. His mother first noticed small stains on his underwear, but one week before admission when riding the subway, the patient fully urinated on himself without appearing to feel bothered or embarrassed. She also reported that the patient had stopped showering. He had started having “counting tics,” constantly counting under his breath. She reported that he continued to have fair sleep and appetite throughout this time. The mother stated that the patient had been recently evaluated by a neurologist who did an electroencephalogram (EEG) which resulted as normal and was then diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed Vyvanse 20 mg PO daily, which she had not been giving to the patient as she did not agree with the diagnosis of ADHD. She denied the patient using any drugs or alcohol, to the best of her knowledge.",Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and schizophrenia,,A Case of New-Onset Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and Schizophrenia in a 14-Year-Old Male following the COVID-19 Pandemic,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10276761/,case_reports_in_psychiatry
"We report on a 35-year-old female with a history of schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, and cocaine use disorder, with multiple previous psychiatric admissions, who was brought to our hospital's crisis unit after her parents called police, complaining that she had become aggressive and was “acting delusional” during an argument. According to her parents, the patient had demanded a DNA test to prove that her parents were not her biological parents and that her son was not her biological son. One week prior to admission, the patient's parents had reported her missing when she “disappeared” from their home soon after being discharged from our hospital following a similar presentation. Prior to admission, the patient's medications included lamotrigine, clonazepam, and long-acting injectable aripiprazole; however, her adherence to treatment recommendations was poor.

Although her parents claimed that she resided with them and her 2-year-old son, the patient endorsed a recent history of homelessness lasting several months. The patient said that during this period of homelessness, she had been sexually assaulted by a stranger in his hotel room. Collateral revealed that per court order, the patient's continued custody of her son was contingent on her adherence to psychotropic medications and inpatient drug rehabilitation. The patient admitted to using recreational drugs frequently over the past 6 months, including crack cocaine, which she stated she had used during the 1-week interval between hospitalizations.

During her initial mental status examination, the patient was poorly groomed, uncooperative, intrusive, and irritable. Her speech was pressured, and she described her recent sleep as poor. She commented that she intended to become pregnant and to sell the baby to an agency for $6,000. She made religious statements about “being fruitful and multiplying” and admitted to recently engaging in hypersexual behavior, explaining that “I have boyfriends on the streets.” She underwent testing for sexually transmitted infections, with reassuring results. She declined voluntary inpatient psychiatric admission and was subsequently screened and committed. We discontinued clonazepam at the time of admission, and we restarted the patient on lamotrigine, adding oral aripiprazole to supplement her long-acting injectable aripiprazole.

During her hospitalization, the patient faced several barriers to efficient psychiatric stabilization. First among these was her insistence on refusing any medications that might cause weight gain, including olanzapine. She endorsed allergies to haloperidol, risperidone, lurasidone, and lithium, with symptoms such as “anxiety,” “eye rolling,” and “facial twitching” in response to these drugs. Because she was adherent to oral lamotrigine and aripiprazole, we chose not to seek treatment over objection to administer a stronger antipsychotic medication that would also serve as an effective mood stabilizer. On hospital Day 4, the patient appeared virtually in family court, where she received an ultimatum to cooperate with treatment recommendations in order to maintain custody of her son. Nonetheless, she remained adamant about not being placed on “weight gainers,” stating that “I can have nine more babies. I want to be sexy.” On hospital Day 6, she tested positive for COVID-19 and was quarantined for 10 days on a medical floor. Her respiratory symptoms included cough and rhinorrhea, and she continued to display manic symptoms, including elated affect, hyperverbality, grandiosity, religious preoccupation, and inappropriate laughter. She exhibited behaviors suggestive of sexual preoccupation, such as raising her shirt during interviews to reveal a protuberant abdomen and repeatedly endorsing a desire to “stay sexy.”

After her quarantine, the patient returned to the psychiatric unit with her manic symptoms unresolved. On hospital Day 17, she requested a pregnancy test due to concerns that she might have become pregnant because she “had sex with a bunch of guys because I was homeless.” The patient seemed reassured when we explained that her admission pregnancy test was negative. We ordered a new quantitative β-hCG test, which was likewise negative. On Day 18, the patient received a maintenance dose of long-acting injectable aripiprazole. On Day 19, she complained of abdominal and back pain, stating “I've been in labor since last night.” She elaborated that “I can feel the head in my crotch” and “when I lay on my back, I feel the little hands and feet.” She also stated that her “water broke” and her “mucus plug broke.” The patient exhibited several physical signs and symptoms of pregnancy, including a distended abdomen, intermittent “pulsating” bilateral lower abdominal cramps, and sensations of fetal movement. In addition, she endorsed amenorrhea for the past year, except for some “mild spotting” three weeks previously. Convinced that her two recent pregnancy tests were “false negatives” and frustrated that members of the treatment team did not believe she was pregnant, she threatened to sue the hospital for failing to provide obstetric care. The patient lamented that “you all think I'm crazy, but I'm actually pregnant.” At this time, she displayed an intensifying religious preoccupation and stated that she was able to communicate with angels and “see Jesus.” She proclaimed that she herself was a prophet who could interpret the “auras” of hospital staff.

The patient agreed to a pelvic exam, which revealed a distended, nontender abdomen. The uterus was nongravid. The patient received acetaminophen and heating pads, and we ordered a transabdominal ultrasound to better assess the etiology of her abdominal pain and in the hopes of resolving her condition via additional evidence of nonpregnancy. At this time, the patient began to refuse all previously prescribed medications because she believed these would harm her “baby.” She did, however, agree to begin fluphenazine elixir, which we prescribed to address worsening psychosis.

When she arrived in the ultrasound suite, the patient offered the radiology technologist four million dollars “if you get this baby right.” She became euphoric while viewing the ultrasound monitor, exclaiming “That's a head, and that's a penis!” Her speech was pressured, and she perseverated on religious themes, requesting that all non-Christian staff leave the suite and instructing staff to “resist the Devil and he will flee from you!” She also demonstrated sexual preoccupation, recalling an experience in which she had “danced after I had sex” and exclaiming about the size of her “baby's penis,” predicting that he would be “sexy like his daddy.” After the procedure, the patient happily told fellow patients that she would soon deliver another child. She said, “I have been having contractions for 19 hr. When the results come back and they find out I am not crazy, they will finally send me to maternity.”

An on-call psychiatry resident presented the radiology report to the patient on hospital Day 20. She emphatically refuted the report, articulating a persecutory delusion of a conspiracy waged against her by the treatment team. She stated that the radiologist must have been “paid off” to switch her ultrasound with that of another patient. She continued to refuse medications that she felt might harm her “baby”; however, she agreed to an increase in her dose of fluphenazine. Following this dose increase, her affect remained labile, with frequent swings between euphoria and irritability, but she ceased making comments indicative of religious and sexual preoccupation. As our hospital is a short-term care facility, we decided to refer the patient to a higher level of care facility. On the day of her discharge, the patient told a nurse that “I don't think I'm pregnant anymore; it's all the shit I have inside me,” referring to her constipated bowels.",Pseudocyesis,,"No Little Feet: Managing Pseudocyesis in a Homeless, Acutely Manic Patient with Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10733053/,case_reports_in_psychiatry
"The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a psychiatric history of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), major depressive disorder (MDD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), dyssomnia, tobacco use disorder, and alcohol use disorder in remission. Her tobacco use disorder began at age 22, and she smoked two packs of cigarettes daily. At age 46, she decreased her tobacco use to smoking one and a half packs of cigarettes daily. Two years later, she further decreased her tobacco use to smoking one pack of cigarettes daily.

Her alcohol use disorder began at age 38, and she drank a pint (473 mL) of hard liquor daily. At age 45, she decreased her alcohol use to half a pint (236.5 mL) of hard liquor daily. The following year, she decreased her alcohol use to only weekends. Two years later, she used alcohol very occasionally. At age 49, her husband passed, and her alcohol use increased to a fifth (750 mL) of gin daily. She was hospitalized twice that year for chronic pancreatitis and quit drinking after the second hospitalization.

She struggled with worsening GAD, MDD, and PTSD since age 39. At age 46, she was prescribed citalopram but did not tolerate it. At age 49, she began regularly seeing outpatient psychiatry. She was prescribed sertraline and prazosin. A few months later, her MDD and PTSD symptoms significantly improved. However, her GAD worsened, and she had more frequent exacerbations. Her sertraline and prazosin dosages were increased. She was also prescribed hydroxyzine but did not tolerate it. Additionally, she received grief therapy as recommended. Her MDD and PTSD symptoms improved significantly more, but her GAD continued to be uncontrolled. Intermittently, she would be out of her medications, and her MDD and GAD would worsen. Her PTSD was stable, even when out of medication.

Also, the patient was prescribed melatonin for her dyssomnia at age 50. Her dyssomnia was uncontrolled despite increasing the melatonin dosage. She did not tolerate trazodone. The patient was then lost to follow-up with outpatient psychiatry for 2 years and returned at age 53. Since then, she has had regular follow-up appointments with outpatient psychiatry.

When she returned to outpatient psychiatry at age 53, she had been off of all psychiatric medications. Her MDD was partially stable. Her PTSD was stable. Her GAD and dyssomnia were uncontrolled. She had resumed drinking small amounts of alcohol on occasion, about once a month, and she continued to smoke one pack of cigarettes daily. Her sertraline was resumed, and she was started on zolpidem. Her dyssomnia improved with zolpidem. Eventually, her sertraline was switched to paroxetine. After trialing multiple medications, she was started on diazepam for a short period for her uncontrolled anxiety. Psychotherapy was also recommended, but she did not take part in it. In April 2020, at age 55, her outpatient psychiatry appointments were converted from in-person to telehealth due to COVID-19 health regulations.

At age 49, the patient first noted fatigue and poor memory. At a follow-up appointment a few months later, she continued to report poor memory. A year later, she reported worsening memory, resulting in losing her keys and forgetting important dates. After that, she did not report fatigue or memory concerns for several years.

In August 2021, at age 56, the patient had mild COVID-19, which did not require hospitalization. Since then, for a period of over 1.5 years, she has reported persistent symptoms associated with LC-19. At her following appointment in December 2021, she noted fatigue, breathlessness, ageusia, poor appetite, weight loss, and “not feeling right.” In January 2022, she also reported poor memory, increased confusion, and being easily distracted. She was concerned she had an unnoticed stroke that was causing these symptoms. In February 2022, these symptoms persisted, and she reported left-side weakness. In April 2022, she also reported anosmia, “brain fog,” and feeling disorganized. She stated she could not describe her cognitive symptoms with words. In August 2022, she also reported generalized weakness, loss of balance, dizziness, body temperature changes, and increased disorganization. She stated she couldn't go to walk-in psychotherapy due to her disorganization.

At this time, she also began experiencing significant impairments in her daily functioning. She reported difficulties with instrumental activities of daily living, such as cooking. In September 2022, she also reported trouble with word finding. In October 2022, she also reported concern regarding her sensation of touch and vision. She reported that things felt different, and she thought her vision “easily missed things.” For example, she would not have initially seen a trash bag and would suddenly notice it was there. In January 2023, she also expressed feeling unable to drive, although once she was in the car, she could complete the task. In March 2023, she noted not being able to feel her left hand and believed she may have had a stroke to cause this. Other than fatigue and difficulty with memory, the patient did not express any of these symptoms or concerns prior to August 2021.

Her social isolation, due to her symptoms, further exacerbated her distress. She reported excessive anxiety regarding the uncertain etiology of her symptoms. She frequently expressed concern that her physicians were not doing enough to diagnose and treat her. She requested a comprehensive work-up and hospital admission. She did not meet the criteria for hospital admission and was not admitted.",Illness anxiety disorder (IAD),,A Case Report on Care-Seeking Type Illness Anxiety Disorder after COVID-19 Infection,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10754632/,case_reports_in_psychiatry

For the past 2 years, he has used alcohol, cocaine, and medical substance (Lyrica and other medications). He has a history of social anxiety with biological symptoms, which are unresponsive to medication. He expressed low self esteem and feelings of worthlessness. He was pessimistic about the future, saying, “I don't see anything ahead for me.” He described a passive death wish, but denied having any active suicidal thoughts. He described feeling fast heartbeats, blushing, trembling, sweating, trouble catching his breath, dizziness, and panic complaints, especially when talking to people and women in specific.

"A 39-year-old Caucasian male presented to inpatient psychiatry after initially presenting to the emergency department with psychosis. He had been found crawling in a parking lot with several feet of intestines dragging on the ground. The patient was only responding internally during the examination, and a urine drug screen was positive only for cannabis. He received an emergent exploratory laparotomy with a partial colectomy. He stabilized medically but became briefly catatonic on day six of hospitalization, which was resolved with intravenous diazepam. On day seven, he was transferred to the inpatient psychiatry unit on a voluntary basis.

On admission to inpatient psychiatry, the patient was fully oriented and able to recall stabbing himself in the abdomen because characters in his mind told him to, having an out-of-body experience as he watched himself pull out several feet of intestines. He felt compelled to follow the voices' commands because he had guilt about his history of sexual abuse towards women. He then recalls running out of his apartment and waking up in the hospital. He endorsed paranoia and auditory hallucinations for the last 10 years but never sought treatment. He felt hopeless, yet believed his potential was infinite. He had no suicidal ideation and expressed a fear of hurting himself upon returning home if the voices persisted.

He had never been diagnosed with a psychiatric illness or received treatment, but he did see a psychiatrist at age 17 after he was charged with indecent exposure. He recalled periods in his life when he had little need for sleep, had racing thoughts, and felt that signs and advertisements were speaking directly to him. His social history was notable for heavy cannabis use beginning at age 18. He was a daily user for 5-6 years and began experiencing paranoia and auditory hallucinations. Despite quitting for two years, the psychotic symptoms persisted, and he reported currently using cannabis 3-4 days per week. He also had a history of trauma and was emotionally and physically abused by his father who had alcohol use disorder.

On a physical exam, the patient had normal speech and appearance, an expansive affect, and poor insight. He endorsed auditory hallucinations of male voices that were commanding and feelings of paranoia.",Schizoaffective disorder,,Self-Evisceration of Intestines as the Initial Presentation of Schizoaffective Disorder,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10027442/,case_reports_in_psychiatry
"A 39-year-old Indonesian woman complained of having had two seizures of 10-min duration. When the hand spasms are stiff, the eyes glance up, and the mouth is foaming and wetting the bed. After the seizure, the patient is unconscious. The patient had no history of previous seizures. The patient also has a history of SLE, diagnosed 5 years ago with high titer ANA and she received cyclophosphamide therapy. The patient had no experience of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, stroke, and tumor.

Her clinical condition showed facial and lingual palsy with central type on the right.

"A 50-year-old male from Nuwakot (nearby Kathmandu), married and unemployed, presented with a history of regular alcohol usage, meeting the ICD-10 diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence over the last 20 years. The Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) score of the patient was 30, indicating severe alcohol dependence. He had delirium tremens twice in the last 4 years. In the past, abstinence was prompted by a cultural factor (mourning of a brother) and a physical factor (pancreatitis). This time, the reason for abstinence was the COVID-19 lockdown. Following the lockdown, the patient was forced to stop alcohol due to its unavailability and inaccessibility. Due to movement constraints, family members had trouble getting treatment during the early withdrawal period. After three days of abstinence, the patient started having symptoms of agitation, decreased sleep, tremors of the hand and body, decreased awareness of the surroundings, visual hallucinations, and was hearing frightening voices. While having these symptoms, the patient tried to jump from the house (but was stopped by family members) and later inflicted a cut injury over the neck with a kitchen knife, stating that it was better to die on own than to die from others. A 3∗1 cm horizontal laceration in the anterior neck was sustained.

He was rushed to Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital (TUTH) for an emergency. He was attended by the emergency, otorhinolaryngology, and psychiatry teams. The mental status examination (MSE) at admission showed that the patient had psychomotor agitation, sweating, tremors of both hands and body, disorientation to time and place, impaired attention and concentration, impaired immediate recall, and recent memory. The Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment Alcohol Scale Revised (CIWA-AR) score was 45, indicating severe withdrawal. The initial investigations revealed thrombocytopenia (9 lac/cu.mm), alcoholic hepatitis (total bilirubin—1.4 mg/dL, direct bilirubin—0.6 mg/dL, SGOT—269 IU/L, SGPT—56 IU/L), hyponatremia (123 mEq/L). However, other electrolytes, random sugar, serology markers, urine routine examination, electrocardiogram, and thyroid profile were all within the normal range. The COVID-19 PCR was negative. The blood sodium level was normalized on the next day of admission.

"A 40-year-old male, separated, non-skilled worker from Dhading presented with a history of alcohol consumption for around 20 years and met the criteria for alcohol dependence syndrome for the last 10 years. His AUDIT score was 24, indicating moderate to severe alcohol dependence. The patient's usual work was disrupted as a result of COVID-19, causing his alcohol relapse. The patient drank alcohol from local neighborhood stores. As a result of the COVID-19 lockdown, shop owners stopped preparing and selling alcohol entirely, resulting in forced abstinence. Following two days of abstinence, he began to claim that the 10–15 individuals were after him and were planning to hurt him. In full consciousness, the patient could hear these voices. The patient fled to hide at a relative's residence nearby. Later, the patient inflicted a cut injury with a kitchen knife, claiming that his act would hold those who followed him accountable for his death. Unlike in the previous case, symptoms arose while the patient was conscious and able to recall all of the events. A 4∗1 cm cut in the anteriolateral neck was sustained.

At the time of admission, the MSE showed that the patient was restless, had tremors of the hands and body, was sweating, was oriented to time, place, and person, his attention and concentration were intact, and his CIWA-AR score was 35, indicating severe withdrawal.

"Our patient, a 16-year-old male with a remote history of rigid thinking, dyslexia, possible auditory processing challenges, and subtle difficulties with math in early childhood, presented to the children's hospital with a 10-month history of abrupt onset and progressively worsening symptoms of marked anger, aggressive behavior, obsessions, intrusive homicidal thoughts, intrusive thoughts about his sexual orientation, nonspecific auditory and visual perceptual anomalies, depersonalization, depression, hopelessness, anxiety, and sleep onset difficulty. He was initially evaluated by our child and adolescent psychiatry inpatient consultation service and then later, followed by our inpatient child psychiatry service and our outpatient child psychiatry clinic. The patient and his family provided written and verbal consent for the publication of this case. Identifiable information has been removed from this case report.

The patient's symptoms began 3 weeks after a confirmed COVID-19 infection. He visited his pediatrician three times over the subsequent month. At the first pediatrics visit, he reported persistent shortness of breath, nasal congestion, and anxiety. His examination was normal, and no laboratory evaluation was reported. He was provided with a prednisone “burst” with 60 mg po for 5 days. He and his family were reassured, and no medical therapy was prescribed. During the second pediatrics visit, he reported worsening anxiety, hopelessness, inattention, poor sleep, and tearfulness. He was started on escitalopram 10 mg daily. At the third visit, his symptoms had progressed further to include distorted thoughts and a fear of being alone, a fear of taking showers, racing thoughts, confusion, and intrusive thoughts. Laboratory evaluation, including a complete blood count (CBC), complete metabolic panel (CMP), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and C-reactive protein (CRP), were all within normal limits. He was continued on escitalopram and referred to counseling.

Five months after his first confirmed infection with COVID-19, he presented to the ED for evaluation of significant worsening of depressive thoughts, suicidal ideation, and thoughts of hurting others. He felt that the thoughts of hurting other people belonged to someone else, describing it as “someone reaching out to me.” Laboratory evaluations of CBC, CMP, ethanol, and urinalysis drug screen (UDS) were all within normal limits or negative. His evaluation did not support an imminent threat to himself or others, and he was discharged home.

Six months after his first confirmed infection with COVID-19, he returned to his pediatrician twice. He first reported additional neuropsychiatric complaints, including auditory hallucinations, derealization, cognitive slowing, and daily headaches. Laboratory evaluation of CBC, CMP, TSH, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), uric acid, and troponin were all within normal limits. Head computed tomography (CT) did not reveal any abnormalities. He and his family were reassured and encouraged to follow up with psychiatry. He returned to his pediatrician again with complaints of difficulty with thought organization, derealization, and continued cognitive slowing and again was reassured that there was no medical cause for his symptoms.

Nine months after his first confirmed infection with COVID-19, he presented to the ED twice within 1 week for worsening symptoms and new episodes of rage, self-injurious behavior, visual and auditory hallucinations, depression and hopelessness, lack of control of thoughts, and transient suicidal ideations. Both visits to the ED included laboratory evaluation of CBC, CMP, ethanol level, and UDS, which were all within normal range or negative. At the first ED visit, he was able to contract for safety and was discharged home. At the second ED visit, he was observed for 5 days. During this time, he did not have any additional episodes of aggression and was discharged home.

Nine and a half months after his first confirmed infection with COVID-19, he returned to his pediatrician with complaints of sore throat, nasal congestion, and shortness of breath. His COVID-19 PCR test was positive, indicating that he had an active COVID-19 infection for the second time. He was instructed to quarantine and was reassured that he could follow up in the outpatient setting.

Ten months after his first infection with COVID-19 (2 weeks after his confirmed reinfection), he presented to the pediatric ED in a neighboring city. He and his parents reported that following his reinfection with COVID-19, his symptoms worsened significantly, culminating with a self-injurious episode during which he “smashed” his face on the ground. He was transferred and admitted to our pediatric inpatient hospitalist service, at which time child and adolescent psychiatry was consulted. He reported increased severity of the previously described symptoms. He reported intrusive thoughts about violence, thoughts about his sexual orientation (having thoughts that he was homosexual although he reported that he identified as heterosexual), and gender identity, which he found distressing. An extensive workup was unremarkable. His urine drug screen 10 with confirmations was positive for marijuana metabolite of 19 ng/mL (>5 ng/mL reference range for positive), to which he reported was due to the mother and patient trying cannabidiol (CBD) oil by mouth to treat his anxiety with reported mild benefit. He remained admitted to the pediatric hospitalist service for a week, during which time provisional diagnoses included psychosis and OCD. He started sertraline daily, olanzapine before bed, and hydroxyzine as needed for anxiety. His symptoms showed minimal improvement.","Neurological complications from COVID-19 that, aside from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), do not easily support any known syndrome or diagnosis",,Progressive Neuropsychiatric Symptoms Following Recurrent COVID-19 Infections in a Previously Healthy Adolescent,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10651327/,case_reports_in_psychiatry
"A 33-year-old male presented to an outpatient psychiatric clinic for evaluation. He endorsed a history of undiagnosed anxiety, methamphetamine use, and multiple legal issues, including various forms of theft. He admitted being externally motivated to seek mental health/substance use disorder treatment because of his involvement with the justice system. However, in addition, he noted the presence of internal motivation—something that is quite new for him. He stated: “I want to do this for myself. I'm tired of living like this.” At the time of our first clinic visit, he reported that he had not used methamphetamine for the past 2 months. Prior to then, he reported using methamphetamine “whenever he could get his hands on it,” ranging from daily to weekly use. At the time of initial evaluation, he did not endorse regular cravings for stimulants. He was unemployed and resided in a sober living facility.

The patient reported having issues maintaining attention and concentration since his childhood. Previous treatment modalities include psychotherapy, but he was never prescribed medications to address his attention and concentration issues. Around this time, he began engaging in illegal behaviors, such as stealing vehicles (four-wheelers, snowmobiles, cars) in his adolescence—all the way up to semitrailers and heavy machinery (e.g., bulldozer) later in his teenage years. He endorsed a tendency to procrastinate, frequently forgetting things, and often spending excessive amounts of time double checking various things (e.g., emails, that things in his household (e.g., oven, shower) are turned off, and ensuring he has his all of his personal belongings) before leaving his residence. He also reported difficulty sitting still and interrupting others when they are busy or when he loses interest or becomes bored.

His stimulant use history began in high school. In addition, he has had periods of heavy alcohol use, which is now in sustained remission after receiving his second driving under the influence ticket and deciding to quit drinking. He regularly uses tobacco (averages one pack of cigarettes per day) and marijuana. No other substances abuse was reported.

Although he has received various negative consequences, he denies feeling that his methamphetamine use was problematic. In fact, he cites various benefits from his use. For example, methamphetamine allows him to “feel calm,” helps “quiet racing thoughts,” and enables him to focus on specific tasks instead of “bouncing around.” Essentially, he views his methamphetamine use as a form of “self-medication” for his mental health symptoms—namely his struggles with attention and concentration but also subsyndromal anxiety and mood.",Attention-deficient hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with stimulant use disorder,,The Use of Lisdexamfetamine to Treat ADHD in a Patient with Stimulant (Methamphetamine) Use Disorder,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10442178/,case_reports_in_psychiatry
"A 16-year-old boy with no history of psychiatric illness in self or family and no psychoactive substance use presented with a seizure disorder of 5 years' duration. The semiology of the seizure was such that there would be an aura-tingling sensation in limbs, ringing in ears, and fearfulness for less than a minute, followed by focal onset seizure-twisting of the upper limb and head toward left with stiffening and jerky movements of all four limbs with unconsciousness associated with tongue bite, injury due to fall and episodes also occurred during sleep. He would be confused for a few minutes after gaining consciousness, complain of headaches, and would sleep at times. He had stopped going to school for 4 years and would refuse to visit his relatives because of fear of a seizure episode. He was treated with sodium valproate up to 800 mg for a year, 2 years back with irregular follow-ups. As a few episodes of seizure occurred in-between, the family opted for treatment from traditional healers instead of medicine, and he had been noncompliant for a year. For the last 4 months, the frequency had increased to 1–3 episodes within a day.

A detailed clinical evaluation was done, and he was diagnosed as a case of focal onset generalized tonic–clonic seizure and advised for baseline blood investigations, EEG, and MRI and was restarted on sodium valproate 300 mg BD with the view of using an adequate dose and optimized to 900 mg in a week. The general physical and systemic examination, blood parameters, and MRI brain were normal. EEG showed slow background activity with sharp and spike-wave complexes in both cerebral hemispheres.

After optimizing the dose of valproate, he was seizure-free for 6 days. However, he presented to the emergency department with drowsiness, decreased alertness, lethargy, and drooling of saliva with a serum valproate level of 76 mg/L. In view of the sedating side effect of sodium valproate, the antiepileptic was changed to tablet LEV 500 mg BD. The drowsiness improved after stopping valproate and starting LEV. On the 2nd day, he started saying that he felt like going crazy. On the fourth day, he was restless, agitated, and tried to run away from the ward with delusion of persecution and auditory hallucination, second person voices commenting.

On the following day, as her diarrhea subsided, she decided to go out shopping, but once at the shops, X thought she and her daughter were in danger, did not feel safe, and decided to return home. When she arrived home, she dropped her phone in the toilet as X believed she was being monitored. Shortly after using the landline, X spoke with her younger sister, who noticed that she had a significant degree of incoherent speech, appeared confused, spoke about bizarre topics, and said things out of character, like making cocaine from sugar. The next day, she was expressing bizarre, sexualized ideas to her sister. Then, X went to the street and banged on car windows, so her sister immediately called emergency services. X was escorted to the emergency department (ED) for further care. At the ED, she was mechanically restrained because she was agitated, disorganized, and threatened to leave the ED. The patient at the time of admission was disoriented as to time and place and was oriented to her sister. She initially calmed down on the persuasion of her sister, however, quickly became verbally aggressive towards the physician and her sister, which according to the informant has rarely been used by the patient.

At that time, he had just been seen by a private psychiatrist and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Aside from the depressive symptoms, he also manifested with strong nihilistic delusions. He did not have any significant physical health conditions. The patient was subsequently admitted to our hospital as a case of major depressive disorder with psychotic features and treated with mirtazapine 30 mg every night, venlafaxine 150 mg every morning, and risperidone 1 mg every night. During his hospitalization, he also underwent six sessions of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and improved significantly after 2 months on the ward.

Upon discharge, he was maintained on mirtazapine, venlafaxine, and risperidone for 2 years. In 2016, risperidone was discontinued. In 2018, due to his stable mood, venlafaxine was also discontinued, and he was only maintained on mirtazapine 30 mg every night. Over the years, he was continued on mirtazapine with doses fluctuating between 15 and 30 mg daily depending on the stress that he experienced at that time. He did not display any manic or hypomanic symptoms during this long period when he was only on mirtazapine. He managed to resume work as a school cleaner and continued on through the years with no significant issues. He was on 6-monthly follow-ups and had been generally compliant with his antidepressant medication.

The patient was apparently well until May 2023 when he was 71 years old. He was then brought to our hospital again by his relatives for evaluation after a change in behavior for 2 weeks. The patient was observed to have significant mood swings and was described to be very active and irritable. He was also noted to have started sending messages with grandiose content and overspending his money. He was physically aggressive toward his relatives, prompting them to bring him to our psychiatric emergency room for evaluation. During the consult, the patient's mood was observed to be labile. His thought process was largely goal directed but was noted to be interspersed with tangential and at times incoherent responses. He endorsed a decreased need for sleep, racing thoughts, and grandiose delusions. The patient did not take any illicit drugs and did not have any family history of mental illness. There were also no new medications given to him recently. Due to the acute change in his mental state, he received a comprehensive organic workup where blood examination revealed unremarkable results.",Bipolar 1 disorder,,From Unipolar to Bipolar: The Diagnostic Evolution in an Elderly Man,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10620020/,case_reports_in_psychiatry
"A 32-year-old male with a history of high-functioning ASD (living independently), depression, hypertension, and acid reflux disease was presented. Collateral information from the father confirmed a diagnosis of ASD that was based on detailed neuropsychological testing in childhood. His home medications included losartan 100 mg daily, famotidine 20 mg daily, and sertraline 50 mg daily. Patient shared that he was started on sertraline for his depressive symptoms 4 days ago, and he had taken his 4th dose that morning. He denied any previous history of antidepressant medication use. On the fourth day of sertraline 50 mg dosing, he presented himself to the emergency department (ED) during evening hours with complaints of restlessness and diffuse muscle stiffness; he felt his legs were “stiff and heavy,” and he “couldn't really move them” and also described “toes retching turning inwards” with an unusual but not painful sensation. On physical examination, he was noted to have bilateral upper extremity tremors, ocular clonus with lateral eye movement, and inducible clonus in his right ankle. Cranial nerve exams II-XII were normal, and deep tendon reflexes were not commented upon, so it is unclear if they were examined or not. Vital signs are notable for a heart rate of 61, blood pressure of 164/94, and oxygen saturation of 98% at room air. Routine lab work showed a normal complete blood count (CBC) with differential comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) that was unremarkable other than mild hypokalemia of 3.3 mEq/L.

"We present an 18-year-old female with a past medical history of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS), chronic insomnia, and schizophrenia who presented to the outpatient adult neurology office. Her childhood was notable for extensive verbal abuse and neglect from her mother, leading to untreated trauma. Three months prior to this visit, the patient was admitted to an inpatient psychiatric facility due to a 9-month history of persecutory delusions, auditory hallucinations, and blunted affect. She was diagnosed with paranoid-subtype schizophrenia and started on Haloperidol 5 mg twice a day. During her stay at the inpatient facility, she had multiple epileptic episodes; she was diagnosed with epilepsy and prescribed Lamotrigine. She initially started a dose of 25 mg once a day for 2 weeks and gradually increased to 50 mg once a day.

The patient scheduled the initial appointment for the chief concern of tremor. She described it as bilateral, occurring at rest and with action, and starting days after beginning Haloperidol. She described her schizophrenia as being well-controlled with the haloperidol and found the medication effective. Her vitals were within normal limits. Her physical exam was benign and only significant for akathisia and blunted affect. Specifically, on a neurological exam, she had intact cranial nerves I–XII, no focal sensory deficits, no motor strength deficits, and symmetric 2+/4+ deep tendon reflexes. Given the context, the tremor was likely an extrapyramidal side effect of Haloperidol. We consulted psychiatry, who recommended either decreasing the dose of haloperidol or switching to a second-generation atypical antipsychotic. The patient preferred to continue taking Haloperidol so we decreased her dose to 3 mg twice a day.

During the same visit, the patient expressed concern that her Lamotrogine dose was “not helping” her seizures. She described her seizures as starting at the age of eight. The seizures usually occurred after stressful situations involving the patient's mother. During the episodes, the patient loses motor control and falls to the ground with bilateral arm and limb shaking. She remains conscious during the episodes. Her uncle, present at the initial visit, described the episodes similarly and relayed that she kept her eyes closed and shook her head throughout the episodes. She did not bite her tongue, express incontinence, or have postictal confusion. Most lasted between “2–4 minutes.”

Even with the antiepileptic medication, the seizures continued to occur “every few weeks.” The patient was never treated for epilepsy before her inpatient stay 6 months ago. Since this visit focused on the patient's tremor, she was scheduled for a follow-up in a week regarding her seizures and told to continue to take the medications and call if she had another episode. She was also prescribed orders to draw routine labs.",Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures (PNES),,Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures (PNES) in the Setting of Trauma and Schizophrenia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10439830/,case_reports_in_psychiatry
"A 12-year-old girl presented with an acute onset of a 1month history of recurrent undesired and intrusive thoughts demanding her to repeat or stop doing certain behaviors to prevent unrelated danger (killing herself or going out in the street). She has stopped eating. The family frequently visited the emergency room (ER) to administer intravenous (IV) fluids. She started dressing and redressing for around 1 hr, repeated washing for around 1 hr, crossing her hands and scratching the wall, and crying and fearing killing herself or going out in the street. Family history: living with her mother. Her father passed away 2 years before presentation due to a medical illness. There is no history of mental illness in the family. She was doing well in school but had frequent absences in the last month before the presentation. Pregnancy, birth, and early development are unremarkable. Medical history: in this initial visit, the family denied the patient had any medical illnesses. The impression was that the patient had OCD. The treatment was SSRI and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). However, because of the acute onset and severity of her symptoms, the patient was reevaluated in follow-up with consideration of possible pediatric acute neuropsychiatric syndrome. She reported that she had recurrent tonsillitis in the last year before presentation, and her last infection was just before the start of her symptoms. Her recurrent tonsillitis was severe to the extent that a tonsillectomy was advised 6-month ago. The obsessive thoughts were associated with symptoms of separation anxiety, being forgetful, and abnormal sensations (tingling sensation) in her palms and feet.

"A 17-year-old junior college student was first brought to our hospital emergency services by his parents for anger management issues. He stayed with his parents, 9-year-old brother, and a domestic helper. Recently, he had quarreled with his brother and thrown his brother's bag down the rubbish chute. He was upset that there was a cockroach at home and demanded that his domestic helper must clean the entire house at night. This incident was so traumatic to the domestic helper that she resigned thereafter. He was described by his parents to be stubborn and spoiled since childhood. However, after further assessment at our emergency services, he was assessed to have no depressive or psychotic symptoms. There was no evidence of any major mental illness. He was not given any medication or follow-up appointment.

One year later, when the patient was 18 years old, he was brought by his parents to our hospital again. Over the past 3 months, he kept asking his mother to buy insurance and then commit suicide, so that the rest of the family could get the insurance payout of millions of dollars. He stayed in his room, searching online almost all day about insurance. He was also unkempt and kept buckets filled with his own urine in his room. He denied low mood or any unusual experiences. His parents shared that he had recently dropped out of the University. According to his parents, the patient's grandfather had a history of schizophrenia, but there was no family history of other mental illness, such as ASD or OCD. He was admitted to the ward for further management, and he was given risperidone 1 mg every night. During this admission, he reported that he had recurrent thoughts about insurance payout and described those thoughts were obsessive and wanted to stop the thoughts. He did not have any hallucinations.

He was noted to have poor eye contact and robotic nature of speech during the admission, but he could have back-and-forth conversations and was able to interact well with other patients on the ward. His preoccupation about insurance payout improved on the ward and he was eventually discharged to follow-up in our clinic.",Autism spectrum disorder,,Misdiagnosis of Psychosis and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder in a Young Patient with Autism Spectrum Disorder,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9943599/,case_reports_in_psychiatry
"A 44-year-old female patient, without a personal or family history of psychiatric illness, was admitted to a psychiatric ward for a psychotic episode which has started three days before, characterized by perplexity, self-referent and mystical delusions, irritability, disorganized behavior, and aggressiveness, that had emerged shortly after a cluster of nocturnal GTC seizures. Neither Schneider's first-rank symptoms nor negative symptoms of schizophrenia were present. Additionally, some degree of mental confusion with temporal disorientation, as well as sustained, divided attention and memory deficits were noticed during psychiatric hospitalization. Past medical history was relevant for epilepsy since her early thirties, which had developed after a moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). She did not regularly attend follow-up neurology appointments and had poor adherence to antiepileptic treatment. Ancillary tests undergone during a previous hospitalization in a neurology ward (seven years before the hospitalization in psychiatry) had documented a focal slowing activity in the left frontotemporal topography on electroencephalogram (EEG) and a right cortico-subcortical parietooccipital lesion of encephalomalacia on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Additionally, she presented an amnestic mild cognitive impairment, possibly secondary to both the poorly controlled epilepsy and the prior TBI.

During the hospitalization in the psychiatric ward for the index psychotic episode, haematological and biochemical screening, thyroid function, folic acid, and cyanocobalamin were normal, serologies for VDRL, HIV, and B and C hepatitis were negative, and valproic acid levels were subtherapeutic.",Postictal psychosis,,Postictal Psychosis: Case Report and Literature Review,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10036178/,case_reports_in_psychiatry
"A 70-year-old woman was urgently admitted to the Department of Acute Psychiatry with a one-week history of fluctuating, polymorphic, and predominant symptoms of affective disorders, including irritability, elevated mood, motor agitation, pressured speech, and lack of insight and concern.

Four to three weeks before presentation, the patient experienced persistent insomnia, anorexia, and constipation, three to two weeks before presentation, she was increasingly stiff, and her gait was unsteady. Seven days before hospitalization, the patient had unintentionally lost 5 kg of weight. On the day of hospitalization to the Department of Acute Psychiatry, her clinical condition worsened. The patient appeared confused with disorientation, limited working memory, and disorganised and pressured speech.

The patient's psychiatric history included one episode of delusion in her third decade of life and two episodes of depression in her fifth decade of life. She was treated with psychotherapy and mirtazapine, which led to the gradual remission of her depressive symptoms. She had no history of mania-like behaviour; however, she had a family history of bipolar disorder and Alzheimer's disease. She did not have any relevant history of somatic illnesses.

Upon admission to the Department of Acute Psychiatry, an organic cause for her mania was immediately suspected due to the clinical presentation of rapidly developing, polymorphous, and fluctuating psychiatric and cognitive symptoms. Therefore, she was transferred to the Department of Internal Medicine.

The findings upon examination at the time of admission were as follows: temperature 36.9°C, heart rate 103 beats per minute, blood pressure 130/80 mmHg bilaterally, respiratory rate 24 cycles per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. Cardiological, pulmonary, abdominal, neurological, and lower limb examinations were unremarkable. The initial blood test showed increased inflammatory markers and elevated liver parameters.

The investigations revealed that the patient was in a stable somatic condition, and she was readmitted to the Department of Acute Psychiatry, where she was treated with a combination of mood-stabilizers, benzodiazepines, and hypnotics. Her psychiatric symptoms gradually improved over a few days, making her transfer to the general ward possible. Four days after readmission, she developed fever. Since the on-site urine stick test results were positive for nitrates, she was treated with antibiotics (pivmecillinam) for a presumed urinary tract infection, though she did not report any urinary tract infection symptoms. After the initiation of antibiotics, C-reactive protein (CRP) fell from 93 mg/L to 66 mg/L (normal range 0–5 mg/L).

In the general ward, the inflammatory markers were stably elevated; CRP remained at 50 mg/L and ferritin at 420 μg/L. A few liver parameters were also elevated; alkaline phosphatase (ALP) at 120 U/L and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GT) 80 U/L. The patient also suffered from stiffness, for which polymyalgia rheumatica was suspected, and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was performed. ESR was increased at 83 mm/h (normal range < 25 mm/h for women older than 50 years). The high ESR in combination with increased infection parameters and liver enzymes raised the clinical suspicion of a malignancy, infection, or rheumatic disorder. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) tests, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), and human leukocyte antigen B 27 (HLA-B 27) typing were negative.",Giant cell arteritis,,"Giant Cell Arteritis Presenting with Mania, Psychosis, and Cognitive Dysfunction: A Case Report",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9938786/,case_reports_in_psychiatry
"J is a mid-20s military service member living independently in the community with a partner. J has a history of multiple ACEs (ACE scale score of 10/10), with caregivers that were both physically and emotionally abusive when J's needs were voiced, resulting in a belief that it was unacceptable, unsafe, and futile to resolve interpersonal problems with caregivers, thus creating a sense of powerlessness and helplessness. Child and family services were never involved, and no legal charges were ever laid against the family for the abuse that J endured. J struggled with containing anger since early childhood resulting in physical and verbal aggression towards peers and teachers at school and family members at home. Caregivers attempted to contain J's aggressive behavior through forced administration of psychiatric medication. While growing up, J feared others and preferred to be alone, despite longing for family and friends. Socialization with peers proved difficult, as J was easily overwhelmed by noise associated with social contact and was frequently ridiculed or misunderstood while trying to verbally communicate.

As a young adult, J left family to enter the military, which became an immediate source of attachment and social belonging. More recently, J became increasingly unable to cope with anger following an ill-suited work position and a musculoskeletal injury, resulting in frequent angry verbal altercations and threats of violence towards military peers who placed restrictions on his activities. This led to disciplinary action and isolation from the unit, which further increased anger, hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts and led to a psychiatric military assessment. During the assessment, J disclosed feelings of intense anger which eventually manifested in an attack on a family member in an amnestic dissociated state. J's history indicated that pharmacological treatments had either been ineffective or caused significant side effects. The military psychiatrist determined J ought to be considered for military discharge. This triggered flashbacks of past childhood abuse and a significant increase in rage. J refused trials of psychiatric medications in the community due to a childhood history of forced medication administration. Due to significant safety concerns and limited ability to control aggressive behavior in the community, J's military psychiatrist referred J for an inpatient admission.

On initial assessment for admission, J appeared distrustful, angry, and concerned about acting out on anger and expressed suicidal ideation. On mental status examination, J was tall and appeared neatly dressed in a military uniform. J appeared hypervigilant and intensely watchful and was well spoken, using a “sharp” tone of voice. J provided a detailed history, demonstrating a goal-directed thought form and a high level of abstract thinking, logical analysis, and good recall. There were no delusions or hallucinations, but J endorsed prominent active suicidal ideation, with intent to act upon these thoughts if not hospitalized; however, there were no immediate, specific suicide plans.","Autism Spectrum Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Unspecified Anxiety Disorder, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)",,Shifting to Trauma-Informed Care in Inpatient Psychiatry: A Case Study of an Individual with Dissociative PTSD Undergoing EMDR Therapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9886477/,case_reports_in_psychiatry
"Our patient was a 41-year-old man with diagnoses of schizoaffective disorder and polysubstance use disorder who was admitted to the inpatient psychiatry unit after an extended stay (24 days) in the psychiatric emergency department, where he presented with manic and psychotic symptoms, including mood lability, pressured speech, grandiosity, paranoia, and disorganized thinking, in the context of medication noncompliance and elopement from his group home. His prolonged psychiatric emergency department course was due to difficulty finding an available inpatient psychiatric bed at or within a reasonable radius of the receiving hospital. Per the patient's guardian, medications confirmed 6 weeks prior to admission included divalproex extended-release (ER) 500 mg twice daily, clonazepam 0.5 mg twice daily, risperidone 4 mg twice daily, risperidone microspheres long-acting injection 25 mg every 2 weeks, quetiapine 400 mg daily, and trazodone 100 mg daily. Based on the fill history and patient report, nonadherence was likely in the weeks prior to admission.

Limited information was available regarding the patient's past psychiatric history, as he was a difficult historian due to his mental state at the time of the initial assessment, as noted above. From a review of available records, he was noted to have been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder in his early twenties and to have been prescribed multiple medications at various points to address manic and psychotic symptoms, including risperidone (up to 8 mg per day of the oral form and up to 25 mg every 14 days of the long-acting injectable form), quetiapine (up to 400 mg per day), and divalproex (up to 1500 mg per day). He was also prescribed trazodone for sleep (up to 50 mg per day) and sertraline for anxiety (unclear dose and duration per records). A note was made of at least partial response to risperidone and divalproex for manic and psychotic symptoms, though the durability of these effects was difficult to assess due to poor compliance. Records documented a history of over 30 psychiatric hospitalizations, usually in the setting of medication noncompliance leading to symptom relapse, with two such hospitalizations in the year prior to presentation. Mention was also made of a suicide attempt three years prior to the presentation, though the circumstances of this were unclear (the patient had reported this to an emergency room provider at an outside hospital; he denied any such history on evaluation in our psychiatric emergency room).

A history of “semi-regular” use of alcohol and cannabis was also noted in his records, beginning in his early twenties, though specific amounts, frequency, adverse consequences, and any treatment for substance use were not documented. Notably, his urine toxicology screen was negative at the time of presentation to our psychiatric emergency room.

Medically, a history of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (for which the patient had refused treatment with medications) was noted, with the last documented CD4 count being in the 430s range at an outside hospital one year prior to presentation.

Family history was significant for schizophrenia and suicide in a maternal uncle. In terms of social history, records indicated that the patient was an only child and that his parents separated when he was an infant; he was noted to have had no relationship with his father. He reported no history of domestic or family conflicts but also noted no current social support at the time of presentation. There was no documented history of his experiencing physical or sexual abuse, though he referred in a prior emergency room visit to a history of “verbal abuse” (unclear how long ago or by whom). He was also noted to have been married in the past but separated for 20 years prior to the presentation; he had no children. He was noted to have lived in numerous group homes over the prior ten years due to mental health issues, with frequent periods of homelessness between these stays, including for three days prior to presentation after he had absconded from his last group home due to paranoid concerns about the staff and residents there. Educationally, he was noted to have completed high school and college but to have been unemployed for ten years prior to presentation, receiving disability income, and having a guardian appointed to him due to mental health issues.

Physical examination upon initial presentation in the psychiatric emergency room was unremarkable other than the patient appearing disheveled, irritable, and guarded. Vital signs were within normal limits. Laboratory tests, including electrolytes, liver function tests, complete blood count, thyroid function tests, urine analysis, and urine drug screen, were all within normal limits.

On mental status examination, he showed loud, pressured speech, guarded and labile affect, irritable and elevated mood, disorganized (tangential, loose) thinking, paranoid delusions that staff and residents at the group home where he had been living were involved in a conspiracy against him, no reported suicidal or homicidal ideation, and poor insight (e.g., denying that he had any mental health issues and that he only needed sertraline to “clear his head”).",Treatment-refractory schizoaffective disorder ,,Loxapine in the Treatment of Manic and Psychotic Symptoms in an Individual Intolerant to Multiple Mood-Stabilizing and Antipsychotic Medications,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10276762/,case_reports_in_psychiatry
