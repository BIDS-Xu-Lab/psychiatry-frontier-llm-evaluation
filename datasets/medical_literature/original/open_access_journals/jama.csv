"A 57-year-old man with a history of HIV disease, hyperlipidemia, and major depressive disorder presented to his primary care physician with depression and insomnia. His mood had been controlled with bupropion, 300 mg/d, for the past several years; however, the recent death of his husband led to increased hopelessness, insomnia, and decreased energy. Results of laboratory studies (thyroid-stimulating hormone, complete blood cell count, and metabolic profile) were unremarkable. His total score on the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) was 16.",The patient has depressive symptoms of at least moderate severity.,"The patient was referred to a psychiatrist. Bupropion was increased to 450 mg/d and his symptoms improved. Approximately a year later, his PHQ-9 score had decreased to 4.",Screening for Depression,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2649161,jama
"A 64-year-old man presented with concern about an abnormal genetic test result for apolipoprotein E (APOE) obtained through his primary care physician. He reported forgetfulness and word-finding difficulties for 3 years but performed all activities of daily living independently and was generally healthy. His father and maternal great aunt developed dementia in their 70s. Physical (including neurologic) examination, basic laboratory studies, and brain magnetic resonance imaging results were normal. The Short Test of Mental Status (STMS) score was 33 (maximal attainable score of 38 indicates best performance). Neuropsychological assessment showed average to above-average performance in all cognitive domains, accounting for age and education. Results of his genetic testing for APOE were reported as follows: “This individual possesses an apolipoprotein E genotype (3 and 4) that indicates, with high specificity, that Alzheimer’s disease is the cause of or a contributor to the observed dementia.”",No diagnosis.,"The apolipoprotein E (APOE) ɛ4 allele is associated with increased risk of Alzheimer disease in a dose-dependent pattern. APOE ɛ4 is neither necessary nor sufficient for Alzheimer disease, cannot rule in or rule out the development of Alzheimer disease dementia, and is not currently recommended in the clinical evaluation of cognitive impairment.",APOE ɛ4 Allele Testing and Risk of Alzheimer Disease,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2775399,jama
"A 61-year-old man with a history of hypertension, psychosis, and recurrent venous thromboembolism was admitted to the emergency department with fatigue, weakness, and arthralgias after an unexplained fall. At presentation, he was experiencing psychosis and being treated in an inpatient psychiatric ward. He was nonadherent with medications and denied drug and alcohol abuse.

On examination, he appeared comfortable. His blood pressure was 150/67 mm Hg; heart rate, 77/min; temperature, 36.7°C (98.1°F); respiratory rate, 16/min; and oxygen saturation, 99% on room air. On both lower extremities, there was peripheral edema with widespread hematomas, scattered ecchymosis, petechiae, and diffuse perifollicular purpura (Figure). The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. Laboratory test results showed a normocytic anemia (hemoglobin level, 5.2 g/dL [reference, 13.5-17.5 g/dL]; mean corpuscular volume, 85 fL [reference, 80-100 fL]); normal platelet count (thrombocytes, 285 ×109/L [reference, 150-400 ×109/L]); and a mild leukopenia (leukocytes, 3.9 ×109 [reference, 4.3-10 ×109/L]). Folic acid level was low (3 nmol/L [reference, ≥5 nmol/L]) and vitamin B12 level was normal (478 pg/mL [reference, 193-982 pg/mL]). Results for iron panel, reticulocyte count, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), international normalized ratio, liver function tests, and levels of indirect bilirubin, haptoglobin, fibrinogen, and creatine kinase were all within reference range. Chest radiographs and computed tomography of the head were negative for any acute pathology. A 12-lead electrocardiogram revealed no abnormalities. Ultrasound of both lower legs showed no thromboembolism.",Vitamin C deficiency (scurvy).,Initiate vitamin C supplementation,A Patient With Psychiatric Illness and Multiple Hemorrhages,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2757314,jama
"A previously healthy 61-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 4-week history of severe weakness and difficulty ambulating independently. He had difficulty rising from a seated position. Additional symptoms included progressive numbness and tingling of the hands and feet. His family also reported progressive memory impairment during this period. An extensive review of systems was otherwise unremarkable, except for a few months of intermittent nausea, increased abdominal bloating, and anorexia.

Physical examination revealed normal vital signs, normal cardiopulmonary findings, atrophy in the calf muscles bilaterally, 4 of 5 symmetric strength in the upper and lower extremity extensor muscles, and an unsteady shuffling gait. He had decreased vibration and proprioception in both lower extremities, with hyperreflexia and a positive Babinski reflex on the left side. Mental status examination revealed delayed recall of 1 of 4 words.

Complete blood cell count revealed a white blood cell count of 4.7 × 103/μL; hemoglobin level, 10.9 g/dL; hematocrit, 31.8%; and platelet count, 202 × 103/μL. Mean corpuscular volume was 119 fL. Results of renal function and liver function tests were normal. Because of the asymmetric hyperreflexia and concern for a spinal cord lesion, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine was performed.",Vitamin B12 deficiency.,"Check a serum vitamin B12 level, MMA level, or both",Progressive Weakness and Memory Impairment in a Middle-aged Man,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2687336,jama

"Ms T is a 60-year-old woman whose husband was diagnosed with stage IV esophageal cancer and who died 9 months later. Although Ms T lost her mother as a teenager and her father and close friend more recently, nothing had prepared her for the loss of her husband. Ms T and her husband were inseparable through 28 years of marriage. They did not have children.

Ms T was emotionally paralyzed following the death of her husband. She began seeing a psychiatrist who recommended taking citalopram, 20 mg daily, and joining a survivor’s support group. Although initially Ms T accepted these suggestions reluctantly, she ultimately concluded that they were helpful.

Ms T has no prior history of depression and denies any suicidal or homicidal ideation. On the 19-item Inventory of Complicated Grief assessment,1 Ms T scored 48. A score of more than 30 is considered a cut point for identifying complicated grief for intervention. Ms T reported that she thinks about her deceased husband so much that it’s hard for her to resume her daily life. She feels herself longing for her deceased husband, and she has had a feeling of being lost since her husband died.",Complicated grief.,Targeted psychotherapy,Treating Complicated Grief,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/1719754,jama
