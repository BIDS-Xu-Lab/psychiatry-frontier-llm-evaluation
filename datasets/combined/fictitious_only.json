        "vignette": "Leroy is a 34 year old male, whose chief complaint is, “I am having intrusive thoughts.” Leroy reports that “since childhood, I have been experiencing intrusive thoughts.” He reports he has met with a number of psychiatrists in the past, and has tried a range of different psychiatric medications. Leroy reports he was recently recommended by his present physician to see a psychiatrist again, given how distressing his intrusive thoughts have become. His previous psychiatrist started him on Zoloft, and gave him recommendation for community based mental health psychotherapist.  Leroy has been taking the Zoloft (200 mg daily) for about 5 years, for what he states his provider thought was “anxiety or depression.” Leroy acknowledges history of periods of “sadness”, stating “yeah sad, sometimes, but not depressed; when things get out of control; its been a while though; when something feels out of reach.” Denied present or past suicidal ideation, and denied problems with active thoughts, plans or intents of harm to self or others. Leroy insists no problems with perceptual distortion or paranoia, and denied thought insertion or thought broadcasting.  Leroy stated that the intrusive thoughts, “first started happening when I was a kid, I was able to cope with them; getting better understanding what they were; ways to get them to go away; calm myself down and regain control and go on with my life; now that is not working.” Leroy states the most recent intrusive thought has been a fear that the chart bus he drives from his local airport to downtown stop will “slide off the road because of ice or snow.” He thinks about this, on average, about 30 to 45 minutes a day.  Leroy endorsed episodes of “panic” and “my body almost feels like its paralyzed; I experience pain from my spine up”, which lasts for a couple of days at a time. With regards to “generalized anxiety”, patient reports “I would have these thoughts about my ailing mother; she has schizophrenia; my body would react to whatever I was thinking about her; my body tenses up when that happens.” Leroy denied any preoccupations about his physical health, nor inability to leave the home because of anxiety. He reports to work regularly, and rarely misses any work unless he is very sick. He says he is never late to work or planned appointments. Leroy has a girlfriend, and says that relationship is going “great.” In his spare time, he continues to join his friends for basketball pickup games and video game nights, which he still enjoys. Leroy does remember a feeling of having to tap the door handle a few times before he opens it, but said this never lasted more than a few second and was not associated with any fear of catastrophic consequences if he did not complete the task.  Leroy acknowledges observed violence/abuse of his parents when growing up, and with harsh parenting to his 3 siblings, patient denied problems with flashbacks, nightmares or hypervigilance associated with the trauma. Patient works second shift, gets home around 1:30 a.m., reports falling asleep at 2:30 a.m. and wakes up at 10/11 a.m., and can typically sleep through the night without interruption. He reports his energy level is “normal through the week.” Denied recent or past mania. Reports contributing stressors are “work --- not the most peaceful environment.” Also reports mother suffers from “type of schizophrenia and for a while she was taking medication and just recently now decided to stop; that’s been going on for quite some time.” Leroy’s urine toxicology returned with marijuana, and TSH level was within normal limits.",

I also lost my career as a farmer.” The patient reports “My girlfriend and I had a good relationship when I used to be able to fish with her; she was a blue blood from the Cape.” Patient reports that he survived being “attacked when I was at a local bar about 4 years ago; the guy smashed a few beer bottles on my head; I had to go to the hospital and they did brain scans; I don’t remember what they said they found.” Patient reports that after that attack, he stopped fishing and started drinking alcohol heavily, at least 8 standard drinks per day, resulting in him missing work, the end of his relationship with his girlfriend, and resulted in getting two DUIs.

The patient frequently punches her mother in the legs, and in the stomach, and the patient even threw her ipad at the pediatrician when she asked the patient what was upsetting her. Most of the patients psychiatric history is gathered from her mother, given how irritable the patient is during the exam. The mother reports Neveah was born 8 weeks pre-mature, spent about 1 month in the neonatal intensive care unit due to problems with breathing, and ultimately discharged home to her care at one month of age. The patient met developmental milestones on or near expected time, and was “clingy” when she was a toddler, but had no problems making friends in daycare and grade school. When patient was about 11 years of age, her biological father left the home to join the military, and has deployed ever since. Around 12 years of age, around summertime, the patient appeared much more talkative, energetic, and would go several days only needing about 3 hours of sleep at night. She was more impulsive during these times, and believed she had super powers to “make her friends get in trouble at school”, even when she was not at school herself. She was never tired the following day. During that same period, she had many temper tantrums throughout the day, almost every day of the week, that seemed disproportionate to circumstances, like having to have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich instead of a peanut butter and fluff sandwich. The tantrums would last several hours in a day. This pattern of behavior would last for several weeks at a time, with periods of months returning to normal mood and behavior. The patient never appeared to be hallucination or responding to internal stimuli, and never appeared sad or depressed. Neveah had to be hospitalized during an episode like this when she was 13 years old. Neveah refuses to take medications for her symptoms. The start of this year academic year, that patient appeared more calm and in good behavioral control, but began to have similar symptoms of irritability, violence at home, not needing to sleep, talking fast, and property destruction at home.",

To manage this distress, she keeps tweezers on her person at all times, checks mirrors every 30 minutes when at home, and avoids staying home for extended periods. She also exhibits contamination concerns manifesting as excessive handwashing (25+ times daily) and using barriers to avoid direct contact with \"unclean\" surfaces out of fear of contracting an illness. Patient believes that she must act on her physical sensations or contamination-related thoughts most of the time or the distress will persist. Patient also collects items like My Little Ponies and Trolls. She has filled her home, garage, basement, a rented warehouse, and now pays to store items in a neighbor's garage despite saying she has little to no money to pay for these expenses. She expresses strong attachment to these possessions, stating she would \"NEVER\" sell them, and has a history of repurchasing items she previously attempted to sell. Patient's medical history is significant for AIDS (diagnosed 2003, currently on Odefsey), and past surgical interventions following a car accident. Her psychological history includes previous diagnoses of PTSD and Bipolar Disorder (which she disputes). Current symptoms of a major depressive episode include anhedonia, restlessness, sleep disturbance (averaging 4 hours nightly), feelings of worthlessness, and difficulty concentrating. These episodes emerge roughly every few month. The patient denied symptoms of psychosis as well as symptoms related to higher than usual energy or goal-directed activity at any time in the past. She endorsed suicidal ideation without current plan or intent, rating likelihood of attempt at 1%. Social support is reportedly limited, with the patient living alone with her two dogs, having infrequent contact with her daughter, and minimal social connections beyond casual acquaintances while shopping.

He currently works full-time managing his hot tub repair company and lives with his girlfriend. His medical history includes multiple substance addictions, particularly opioids (requiring Suboxone and later Methadone treatment), and previous diagnoses of OCD, ADHD, anxiety disorder, and depressive disorder. He reports a significant history of head trauma (8 concussions), one seizure episode while incarcerated, and multiple incarcerations for offenses including gun possession, burglary, and vehicle theft. His psychiatric medication history includes Adderall, Concerta, Zoloft, an unspecified antidepressant, and Trazodone. The chief complaint involves symptoms that began at approximately age 18 during his first incarceration and have intensified in the past year, coinciding with work stress. Problematic behaviors include arranging items in specific places with extreme rigidity (unable to buy new items that don't have a \"place\"), performing rituals in sets of three, and a specific handwashing ritual. He experiences intrusive thoughts about harming others (particularly fears of stabbing, shooting, or raping strangers) and engages in compulsive behaviors (brushing his hand from hairline to ear three times) to alleviate associated anxiety. He also reports persistent checking behaviors due to memory doubts, a need for things to feel \"just right\", and specific ordering rituals. Additionally, he endorses current anhedonia, decreased appetite, fatigue, and concentration difficulties that wax and wane every few months. He shared that these symptoms are distressing, though mildly impairing in his social, work, and leisurely activities. He denies current suicidality, self-harm, or hallucinations/delusions.

He presents with severe symptoms characterized primarily by intrusive thoughts related to morality, contamination, and harm. Unwanted thoughts include fears of transmitting sexual fluids to others (which he believes would make him \"a rapist\"), concerns about accidentally killing insects, moral distress about consuming animal products, and beliefs that viewing violent media constitutes \"condoning\" violence. To manage these thoughts, he engages in extensive reassurance seeking, repeatedly checking lab results at work, avoiding video games and television, dietary restrictions, and some handwashing. He reports these symptoms significantly interfere with daily functioning, preventing him from living independently. They cause intense distress that frequently culminates in panic attacks. Patient has a complex history related to his gender identity, reporting he has identified as male throughout his life despite being assigned female at birth. He is currently taking low-dose testosterone but conceals this from his family, who he believes are interfering with his plans for gender-affirming surgeries. He reported childhood \"delusions\" about being \"from a fantasy world and chosen by gods\" that resolved by age 18. Patient previously took fluvoxamine for panic symptoms until approximately age 24, reporting significant symptom exacerbation upon discontinuation. He describes himself as introverted with limited social connections, identifying as asexual, though questioning if this might be avoidance related to triggering thoughts. His social anxiety dates back to middle and high school, when he was \"pretty much mute\" with few friends. Patient describes his mood as \"always a little depressed\" with recent intensification. He endorses feeling sad, empty, and hopeless most days, anhedonia, sleep disturbances, psychomotor retardation, fatigue, worthlessness, guilt, concentration difficulties, and suicidal ideation. He frequently believes he \"needs to be dead\" and that suicide would be \"the moral thing to do\" following morally repugnant intrusive thoughts, though he denies current plan or intent (estimating a 5% chance of suicide within three months). He struggles with activities of daily living without parental support and expresses frustration that his thoughts and behaviors interfere with his gender expression. Despite these significant symptoms, he demonstrates good insight, noting that his thoughts are not consistent with who he is and what he values.",

Their psychiatric history includes diagnoses of MDD and GAD at age 15-16, PTSD in 2016 following emotional abuse by high school friends, and ADHD in 2018 (without neuropsychological evaluation). Current medications include Lisdexamfetamine 50mg (since 2018), various supplements, and a contraceptive injection. They previously tried multiple antidepressants (2011-2015) but discontinued each after approximately two weeks due to suicidal ideation and, in one case, motor disturbances. The patient consumes alcohol socially (3-5 drinks monthly) and has been vaping marijuana 1-3 times weekly for three months primarily to aid sleep and manage anxiety. The patient's primary symptoms onset around age 5 with intrusive visualizations of falling down stairs along with perfectionism through rewriting notes until they felt \"just right\". Currently, they experience significant distress when surroundings are not in the \"right spot\", spending up to 12 hours reorganizing belongings without breaks, which would cause severe distress if interrupted. This \"not just right\" feeling impairs their ability to meet deadlines, complete job applications, and fulfill social obligations. They also engage in checking behaviors when packing (counting socks repeatedly, checking for essential items) and experience distressing sexual intrusive thoughts. Additionally, the patient exhibits skin-picking behaviors, spending over an hour picking at ingrown hairs until bleeding, scratching their neck and jaw during conversations, and tearing at cuticles, with symptoms worsening during periods of anxiety. They've attempted to stop by wearing pants constantly but have been unsuccessful. The patient has a significant history of depression with three past suicide attempts (overdoses in 2014, 2015, and 2017) and self-injury through cutting (stopped in 2017). They currently experience passive suicidal ideation, anhedonia, decreased appetite, sleep difficulties, psychomotor agitation, feelings of worthlessness, and concentration problems, though they report 0% chance of self-harm in the next three months. Social anxiety manifests as persistent fear of judgment and rejection, with distressing rumination about social interactions and excessive reassurance-seeking that has cost them friendships.

They report a history of childhood anxiety, perfectionism, and ritualistic self-punishment behaviors starting in the third grade. Currently, their most debilitating symptom is anxiety about \"contaminated air\" when others cough or sneeze, prompting them to cover their face and hold their breath even when the trigger is far away or on television. They engage in checking and counting behaviors based on the number 3, including checking mirrors while driving, locking/unlocking their car, and tapping their toothbrush. These compulsions are experienced as uncontrollable, with the patient reporting they sometimes modify behaviors (like holding an imaginary door handle in their pocket) when the original compulsion would be disruptive. At approximately age 16, the patient developed anorexia nervosa, restricting their food intake and ultimately requiring intervention from parents and a treatment team. Despite gaining weight under external pressure, the patient continues to restrict eating, has a distinct fear of gaining weight, becoming fat, fasting until dinner, drinking coffee to intentionally upset their stomach. Their BMI currently falls within the normal range. Around the same time their eating disorder developed, the patient experienced depressive symptoms including hopelessness, low motivation, and self-harm behaviors (pulling hair, cutting, punching stomach). They had suicidal ideation during high school, including thoughts of jumping in front of a train and fantasizing about wandering into hallways during a school shooting. Current suicidal thoughts are less frequent and persistent. Current depressive symptoms have been subsyndromal (though not entirely absent) for about 7 months. Specifically, the patient currently denies experiencing depressive symptoms for more than a few hours every couple of weeks but rates their chance of self-harm in the next three months at 50% (suicide attempt chance at 0%).

The patient previously attempted treatment with Zoloft (10mg) for OCD symptoms but discontinued due to emotional blunting effects. She reports consuming alcohol 1-2 glasses a few times monthly and using marijuana daily when available, which she finds helpful for intrusive thoughts despite occasionally triggering anxiety. The patient's most distressing symptoms involve intrusive thoughts about sexually harming children, accompanied by physiological responses that she describes as \"groinal\". These thoughts were particularly distressing during her work as a childcare specialist, where she engaged in compulsive staring at children's genital areas to \"prove\" she wasn't sexually attracted to them and sometimes avoided changing diapers due to fear of sexual arousal. After experiencing an intrusive dream about sexually harming her brother in January 2021, she experienced physical symptoms (shaking, freezing) when interacting with him and subsequently increased their time together as a form of reassurance. Additionally, the patient reports significant health anxiety focused on getting cancer, HIV, and STIs, leading to excessive symptom research. The patient experiences panic attacks (1-2 times monthly) lasting 15-30 minutes when triggered by intrusive thoughts, with symptoms including shortness of breath, crying, sweating, racing heart, chest pain, and feelings of detachment. She reports seeking reassurance from her mother when these thoughts become overwhelming. The patient also endorses distressing and functionally impairing social anxiety in small groups, leading to significant avoidance; however, she stated that this anxiety is primary due to her unwanted/intrusive thoughts rather than a fear of being judged. She reports experiencing over 50 depressive episodes in the past year, each lasting at least two weeks with symptoms including decreased appetite, sleep disturbance, fatigue, guilt, concentration difficulties, and thoughts of death. She described these episodes as challenging to manage, but \"not completely debilitating\".",

His mother reports that her son engages in \"constant defiance\", experiences rapid mood changes, and demonstrates impulsive behavior, including occasional incidents of pulling knives (though never pointing them at anyone). Daily arguments at home frequently escalate to physical aggression, particularly with his mother and brother. Erik has expressed statements such as \"I wish I could go to sleep and never wake up\" and reports feeling depressed \"randomly\" a couple times per month since second or third grade, though he denies daily depressive symptoms or changes in sleep or appetite. Erik's behavioral difficulties have manifested in both home and school environments. In school, he has engaged in speaking out of turn, refusing to follow directions, agitating teachers, and having \"screaming matches\" with staff.

He has a Section 504 plan that allows for movement opportunities and frequent breaks when needed.

His mother reports implementing a point system for rewards and consequences but notes limited effectiveness due to inconsistent expectations between parents. Formal assessment indicates that Erik demonstrates a pattern of emotional dysregulation, defiance, and aggressive behavior, with physical aggression occurring approximately every other day at home. Assessment also confirms prior symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, which are present across settings and contribute to emotional dysregulation and academic underperformance relative to ability.",

He spends approximately six hours per day engaged in or thinking about this behavior, which he cannot control through willpower alone, though he can interrupt it by creating a physical barrier in his line of sight or wearing sunglasses.

The patient acknowledged witnessing a traumatic event he chose not to disclose but denied re-experiencing or avoidance symptoms consistent with PTSD. Medical history includes hypertension treated with Amlodipine (dose unknown), with no psychiatric medication history reported.Throughout the assessment, the patient demonstrated limited insight into his symptoms, was guarded in his responses, and had not disclosed his problems to his long-term partner.

He started seeing a therapist recently after mom noticed that he was talking to her less and appeared less energetic. Mom reports that the patient has also been behaving oddly, accusing downstairs neighbors to be trying to spy on him and talking poorly about him. She also reports that he told her he feels unsafe because people are trying to harm him. She also noticed that he has been more irritable, occasionally punching walls but never people. When patient was interviewed directly, he appeared constricted and dysphoric, with hair covering his eyes. He spoke softly. He reported that he has been feeling angry because he has been thinking more about how his biological father used to abuse his mom, even though his biological father no longer is in their life. He reports that he has been experiencing poor memory, poor concentration, feeling anxious and ruminating frequently. He also admits to having thoughts of death several months ago and does have access to guns although he has never attempted to kill himself. He does report that he intentionally cut his wrist a few months ago to cope with his feelings but denied having suicidal intent. He also endorses poor sleep and low mood. He admits that he is a long-time bars user (referring to Xanax) but does not know the dosage and is evasive when asked about his frequency and most recent use. He also reports that he smokes marijuana but again does not provide details regarding his use. He states that more recently, he started using marijuana specifically to help with new-onset paranoia. He describes his mind playing tricks on him, morphing objects into faces leading to feeling scared. Lab work collected at the hospital did not show abnormalities other than a positive urine cannabinoid screen. Patient was started on fluoxetine for his depression symptoms and aripiprazole for his psychotic symptoms and he improved after a week on this medication combination, reporting better mood and no longer feeling paranoid.",

She states that initially, he feared catching COVID. However, she states it has been 3 years of such behaviors and believes that his cleaning behaviors have actually intensified. She noticed that he started washing his hands more often, sometimes showering multiple times in a day, and last week, saw him use a Clorox disinfecting wipe to clean his body. She became concerned for the potential of chemical irritation on his skin. When patient was addressed directly, patient reports that he needs everything to be clean. He expresses an intense fear that his belongings and space are contaminated with germs if he does not clean then regularly. He alludes to his view of the outside as “dirty” and that his room is “clean.” He feels the intense urge to have anything that enters his room to be decontaminated otherwise his whole room will become contaminated. He describes an intense feeling of anxiety if he cannot clean things before they enter his room. He states that he spends a lot of time washing his hands because if he misses a spot or brushes his hand against the side of the sink, he needs to start over to ensure that they are fully clean. He endorses similar patterns with showering and wiping down belongings, often needing to start over to ensure he did not miss any spots and has fully decontaminated. He does mention that he has been struggling in school due to having less time to study with his cleaning obligations.",

She tells the evaluating psychiatrist that she had gotten into an argument with her husband. She states that she and her husband has been living in a hotel for the past week due to a conflict between her and her mother-in-law. She reports that she feels her husband does not understand nor respect her because he was requesting to return home to be closer to his workplace. She states that she was surprised at the argument because he is usually a “good man.” When asked what made her feel disrespected this time, she replied it was because he was refusing her request to continue staying at the hotel and that he usually never says no to her. When asked her reason for staying, she stated that she just “did not feel ready” to return home yet because being around her mother-in-law stressed her out. She did not understand why her husband was not accommodating her discomfort. However, when pointing out husband’s discomfort with the long commute time to work, she minimized his concern and did not acknowledge his struggle, instead redirecting the conversation to her own feelings. When asked about the reason for her disagreement with her mother-in-law, she states it is because her mother-in-law does not recognize her efforts for contributing to the household. She states that, “My mother-in-law always complains that I don’t do chores and don’t work. But she doesn’t get it that I’m the one supporting my husband at his job and that he should be the main breadwinner anyways as the husband. Besides, I did the dishes today, it’s not even true that I don’t do chores.” When addressing the physicians, she addresses them casually (e.g. “dude,” “man,” etc.) and states to them, “You’re a doctor, you should be smart enough to understand me.” She denies that she has any mental issues that requires her to remain in the hospital, stating that, “Smart people like us, we get misunderstood, you get it right? That’s why they sent me here.” She also alludes to believing that her mother-in-law called the police to have her brought here to get her away from her husband because she’s “jealous I get to spend more time with her son than she does.” When informing her that the reason for her hospitalization was the threat of suicide, she casually waves it off, stating, “Oh, I don’t actually want to kill myself, I just said that to get my husband to listen to me.”",

He had difficulty maintaining focus and gave vague or tangential responses. Making statements such as “god made me a rabbit and you are my master” and “I have killed multiple planets in my backyard”. Roommate reported that he had been isolating and making odd statements that \"sometimes doesn’t make sense.\" But this is the worst he has seen him. For past two-three months or so, the patient stopped attending parties and classes. The patient has a history of chronic marijuana use since age 14, the roommate also reported that he tried “crack cocaine and mushrooms” last year during their Arizona trip but had a “bad trip” at that time and he has not witnessed any substance use since then.

        "vignette": "A 16-year-old Hispanic female, immigrated to the United States two years ago from a conflict-affected region in South America, presented to the child psychiatry clinic for follow up evaluation and with recent complaints of frequent and severe verbal outbursts at school. The patient had a documented history of chronic sexual abuse and has also witnessed violence, both in her country of origin and during migration. She was accompanied by her biological mother. The patient presented for an initial evaluation six months ago and was lost to follow up since then. At that time, a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was made by the same outpatient mental health provider. The patient reported significant improvement in frequency and intensity of nightmares since started on medications six months ago. Re-established care because the school staff reported frequent episodes (occurring one-two times per week) in which the patient would become suddenly angry, shouting profanities and making personally hurtful comments toward teachers, administrators, and peers. These episodes were often precipitated by perceived criticism, sudden changes in expectations, or ambiguous social cues. Despite these outbursts, the patient was described as highly intelligent, academically capable, and frequently helpful to classmates. She was logical and articulate in conversations when calm but maintained a guarded and cautious interpersonal style. During clinical interview, the patient was initially reserved but opened up during the later parts of the interview. She endorsed persistent feelings of anger, mistrust, and fear, particularly in unfamiliar or male authority-driven environments. She denied hallucinations, current suicidal ideation, or substance use. Sleep disturbances, including frequent nightmares and early-morning awakenings, were reported. Cognitive assessment suggested average to above-average intellectual functioning, and no evidence of developmental delays or psychotic symptoms was noted or reported. Prior to migration, the patient had limited access to formal education, which appeared to contribute to a heightened sensitivity to perceived failure or criticism in the current school environment.",
