        "vignette": "A black male in his early 20s with a remote history of depression as an adolescent and current cannabis use presented following an assault while incarcerated. He was found unconscious with mental status changes and brought to the hospital. Initial examination and work-up revealed right-sided periorbital edema and ecchymosis. The patient was arousable to noxious stimuli but would quickly return to sleep and was not interactive during multiple examination attempts. The emergency department staff believed there was a volitional component to his lack of participation in the exam, as he would push away from providers as they examined him or lie unresponsive. At one point, the patient was able to ambulate briefly while in the emergency department (although he ran into several objects) and tolerated an oral intake challenge with juice. Over the course of 5 days, the patient was returned to the emergency department by the facility four more times due to concerns that his mental status was not improving. The facility reported the patient was unable to attend to his ADLs. He was seen to be withdrawn, not eating or drinking, and toileting on himself or the floor. Additionally, guards (as he was incarcerated for part of his hospital admission) reported that he would occasionally speak to family members and staff. However, when he was offered paperwork to sign himself out of jail with an ankle monitor, he only gazed at the officer without speaking.\n\nUrine toxicology was positive for THC and a negative blood alcohol level. He was found to have ketones consistent with starvation ketosis. Lumbar puncture revealed CSF cell count with six total nucleated cells present, <2,000 RBC, 54 mg/dL glucose, and 39 mg/dL protein. Meningitis/encephalitis panel for 14 common viral and bacterial pathogens and antibody testing for West Nile Virus was negative. CT of the head showed no fractures of the face/vertebra and was negative for other acute findings. EEG was read as consistent with a normal drowsy state. MRI of the brain, both with and without contrast, showed a cerebellar developmental venous anomaly but no acute findings. A neurology consult was obtained. His neurologic exam was noted to be variable, with poor participation despite repeated prompting, making full examination difficult. He responded to pain equally in all extremities, demonstrated no abnormal movements, had 2+ reflexes symmetrically, and normal pupillary response. Neurology ultimately felt that his LP, MRI, and EEG were unremarkable, and his symptomatology could be explained by postconcussive symptoms.\n\nOnce the patient was admitted, he was initially treated with a trial of Modafinil for suspected postconcussive syndrome, to which there was no response. On Day 6 of his hospitalization, when the psychiatric consultation service reconsidered his disordered behavior, psychomotor retardation, and speech with consideration for the presence of catatonia, the question of “volitional” inactivity took on a new meaning. There were numerous catatonia signs present to variable degrees: mutism, decreased oral intake, negativism, withdrawal, and decreased spontaneous movement. No automatic obedience, ambitendency, or rigidity was appreciated. ",

        "vignette": "A 12-year-old male with no specific birth or medical history became concerned about lower abdominal distention and began reducing his food intake 3 months prior to consultation. He exercised obsessively according to his food intake. Although he was considerably losing weight, he commented that his belly was fat and did not want it to get any fatter. Body image disturbances and anxiety regarding being overweight were observed. During his initial consultation, he was very lean, with a body mass index (BMI) of 11.5 kg/m2. He also had sinus bradycardia with a heart rate of approximately 40 beats/min. We attempted to improve his weight with enteral nutritional supplements while identifying underlying diseases by head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and abdominal ultrasound. However, he became disoriented and was emergently hospitalized 7 days after his first visit. On admission, he was 145 cm tall, weighed 20.9 kg (BMI: 9.9 kg/m2), and presented with impaired consciousness with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) E3V4M6, bradycardia with a heart rate of about 40 beats/min, and slow breathing with a respiratory rate of about 10 cycles/min. Blood gas analysis and blood test revealed hypercapnia, hypoglycemia, and elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and transaminases. His movements were slow but not paralytic and his cranial nerves were normal. ",

        "vignette": "We report on a 35-year-old female with a history of schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, and cocaine use disorder, with multiple previous psychiatric admissions, who was brought to our hospital's crisis unit after her parents called police, complaining that she had become aggressive and was “acting delusional” during an argument. According to her parents, the patient had demanded a DNA test to prove that her parents were not her biological parents and that her son was not her biological son. One week prior to admission, the patient's parents had reported her missing when she “disappeared” from their home soon after being discharged from our hospital following a similar presentation. Prior to admission, the patient's medications included lamotrigine, clonazepam, and long-acting injectable aripiprazole; however, her adherence to treatment recommendations was poor.\n\nAlthough her parents claimed that she resided with them and her 2-year-old son, the patient endorsed a recent history of homelessness lasting several months. The patient said that during this period of homelessness, she had been sexually assaulted by a stranger in his hotel room. Collateral revealed that per court order, the patient's continued custody of her son was contingent on her adherence to psychotropic medications and inpatient drug rehabilitation. The patient admitted to using recreational drugs frequently over the past 6 months, including crack cocaine, which she stated she had used during the 1-week interval between hospitalizations.\n\nDuring her initial mental status examination, the patient was poorly groomed, uncooperative, intrusive, and irritable. Her speech was pressured, and she described her recent sleep as poor. She commented that she intended to become pregnant and to sell the baby to an agency for $6,000. She made religious statements about “being fruitful and multiplying” and admitted to recently engaging in hypersexual behavior, explaining that “I have boyfriends on the streets.” She underwent testing for sexually transmitted infections, with reassuring results. She declined voluntary inpatient psychiatric admission and was subsequently screened and committed. We discontinued clonazepam at the time of admission, and we restarted the patient on lamotrigine, adding oral aripiprazole to supplement her long-acting injectable aripiprazole.\n\nDuring her hospitalization, the patient faced several barriers to efficient psychiatric stabilization. First among these was her insistence on refusing any medications that might cause weight gain, including olanzapine. She endorsed allergies to haloperidol, risperidone, lurasidone, and lithium, with symptoms such as “anxiety,” “eye rolling,” and “facial twitching” in response to these drugs. Because she was adherent to oral lamotrigine and aripiprazole, we chose not to seek treatment over objection to administer a stronger antipsychotic medication that would also serve as an effective mood stabilizer. On hospital Day 4, the patient appeared virtually in family court, where she received an ultimatum to cooperate with treatment recommendations in order to maintain custody of her son. Nonetheless, she remained adamant about not being placed on “weight gainers,” stating that “I can have nine more babies. I want to be sexy.” On hospital Day 6, she tested positive for COVID-19 and was quarantined for 10 days on a medical floor. Her respiratory symptoms included cough and rhinorrhea, and she continued to display manic symptoms, including elated affect, hyperverbality, grandiosity, religious preoccupation, and inappropriate laughter. She exhibited behaviors suggestive of sexual preoccupation, such as raising her shirt during interviews to reveal a protuberant abdomen and repeatedly endorsing a desire to “stay sexy.”\n\nAfter her quarantine, the patient returned to the psychiatric unit with her manic symptoms unresolved. On hospital Day 17, she requested a pregnancy test due to concerns that she might have become pregnant because she “had sex with a bunch of guys because I was homeless.” The patient seemed reassured when we explained that her admission pregnancy test was negative. We ordered a new quantitative β-hCG test, which was likewise negative. On Day 18, the patient received a maintenance dose of long-acting injectable aripiprazole. On Day 19, she complained of abdominal and back pain, stating “I've been in labor since last night.” She elaborated that “I can feel the head in my crotch” and “when I lay on my back, I feel the little hands and feet.” She also stated that her “water broke” and her “mucus plug broke.” The patient exhibited several physical signs and symptoms of pregnancy, including a distended abdomen, intermittent “pulsating” bilateral lower abdominal cramps, and sensations of fetal movement. In addition, she endorsed amenorrhea for the past year, except for some “mild spotting” three weeks previously. Convinced that her two recent pregnancy tests were “false negatives” and frustrated that members of the treatment team did not believe she was pregnant, she threatened to sue the hospital for failing to provide obstetric care. The patient lamented that “you all think I'm crazy, but I'm actually pregnant.” At this time, she displayed an intensifying religious preoccupation and stated that she was able to communicate with angels and “see Jesus.” She proclaimed that she herself was a prophet who could interpret the “auras” of hospital staff.\n\nThe patient agreed to a pelvic exam, which revealed a distended, nontender abdomen. The uterus was nongravid. The patient received acetaminophen and heating pads, and we ordered a transabdominal ultrasound to better assess the etiology of her abdominal pain and in the hopes of resolving her condition via additional evidence of nonpregnancy. At this time, the patient began to refuse all previously prescribed medications because she believed these would harm her “baby.” She did, however, agree to begin fluphenazine elixir, which we prescribed to address worsening psychosis.\n\nWhen she arrived in the ultrasound suite, the patient offered the radiology technologist four million dollars “if you get this baby right.” She became euphoric while viewing the ultrasound monitor, exclaiming “That's a head, and that's a penis!” Her speech was pressured, and she perseverated on religious themes, requesting that all non-Christian staff leave the suite and instructing staff to “resist the Devil and he will flee from you!” She also demonstrated sexual preoccupation, recalling an experience in which she had “danced after I had sex” and exclaiming about the size of her “baby's penis,” predicting that he would be “sexy like his daddy.” After the procedure, the patient happily told fellow patients that she would soon deliver another child. She said, “I have been having contractions for 19 hr. When the results come back and they find out I am not crazy, they will finally send me to maternity.”\n\nAn on-call psychiatry resident presented the radiology report to the patient on hospital Day 20. She emphatically refuted the report, articulating a persecutory delusion of a conspiracy waged against her by the treatment team. She stated that the radiologist must have been “paid off” to switch her ultrasound with that of another patient. She continued to refuse medications that she felt might harm her “baby”; however, she agreed to an increase in her dose of fluphenazine. Following this dose increase, her affect remained labile, with frequent swings between euphoria and irritability, but she ceased making comments indicative of religious and sexual preoccupation. As our hospital is a short-term care facility, we decided to refer the patient to a higher level of care facility. On the day of her discharge, the patient told a nurse that “I don't think I'm pregnant anymore; it's all the shit I have inside me,” referring to her constipated bowels.",

        "vignette": "The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a psychiatric history of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), major depressive disorder (MDD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), dyssomnia, tobacco use disorder, and alcohol use disorder in remission. Her tobacco use disorder began at age 22, and she smoked two packs of cigarettes daily. At age 46, she decreased her tobacco use to smoking one and a half packs of cigarettes daily. Two years later, she further decreased her tobacco use to smoking one pack of cigarettes daily.\n\nHer alcohol use disorder began at age 38, and she drank a pint (473 mL) of hard liquor daily. At age 45, she decreased her alcohol use to half a pint (236.5 mL) of hard liquor daily. The following year, she decreased her alcohol use to only weekends. Two years later, she used alcohol very occasionally. At age 49, her husband passed, and her alcohol use increased to a fifth (750 mL) of gin daily. She was hospitalized twice that year for chronic pancreatitis and quit drinking after the second hospitalization.\n\nShe struggled with worsening GAD, MDD, and PTSD since age 39. At age 46, she was prescribed citalopram but did not tolerate it. At age 49, she began regularly seeing outpatient psychiatry. She was prescribed sertraline and prazosin. A few months later, her MDD and PTSD symptoms significantly improved. However, her GAD worsened, and she had more frequent exacerbations. Her sertraline and prazosin dosages were increased. She was also prescribed hydroxyzine but did not tolerate it. Additionally, she received grief therapy as recommended. Her MDD and PTSD symptoms improved significantly more, but her GAD continued to be uncontrolled. Intermittently, she would be out of her medications, and her MDD and GAD would worsen. Her PTSD was stable, even when out of medication.\n\nAlso, the patient was prescribed melatonin for her dyssomnia at age 50. Her dyssomnia was uncontrolled despite increasing the melatonin dosage. She did not tolerate trazodone. The patient was then lost to follow-up with outpatient psychiatry for 2 years and returned at age 53. Since then, she has had regular follow-up appointments with outpatient psychiatry.\n\nWhen she returned to outpatient psychiatry at age 53, she had been off of all psychiatric medications. Her MDD was partially stable. Her PTSD was stable. Her GAD and dyssomnia were uncontrolled. She had resumed drinking small amounts of alcohol on occasion, about once a month, and she continued to smoke one pack of cigarettes daily. Her sertraline was resumed, and she was started on zolpidem. Her dyssomnia improved with zolpidem. Eventually, her sertraline was switched to paroxetine. After trialing multiple medications, she was started on diazepam for a short period for her uncontrolled anxiety. Psychotherapy was also recommended, but she did not take part in it. In April 2020, at age 55, her outpatient psychiatry appointments were converted from in-person to telehealth due to COVID-19 health regulations.\n\nAt age 49, the patient first noted fatigue and poor memory. At a follow-up appointment a few months later, she continued to report poor memory. A year later, she reported worsening memory, resulting in losing her keys and forgetting important dates. After that, she did not report fatigue or memory concerns for several years.\n\nIn August 2021, at age 56, the patient had mild COVID-19, which did not require hospitalization. Since then, for a period of over 1.5 years, she has reported persistent symptoms associated with LC-19. At her following appointment in December 2021, she noted fatigue, breathlessness, ageusia, poor appetite, weight loss, and “not feeling right.” In January 2022, she also reported poor memory, increased confusion, and being easily distracted. She was concerned she had an unnoticed stroke that was causing these symptoms. In February 2022, these symptoms persisted, and she reported left-side weakness. In April 2022, she also reported anosmia, “brain fog,” and feeling disorganized. She stated she could not describe her cognitive symptoms with words. In August 2022, she also reported generalized weakness, loss of balance, dizziness, body temperature changes, and increased disorganization. She stated she couldn't go to walk-in psychotherapy due to her disorganization.\n\nAt this time, she also began experiencing significant impairments in her daily functioning. She reported difficulties with instrumental activities of daily living, such as cooking. In September 2022, she also reported trouble with word finding. In October 2022, she also reported concern regarding her sensation of touch and vision. She reported that things felt different, and she thought her vision “easily missed things.” For example, she would not have initially seen a trash bag and would suddenly notice it was there. In January 2023, she also expressed feeling unable to drive, although once she was in the car, she could complete the task. In March 2023, she noted not being able to feel her left hand and believed she may have had a stroke to cause this. Other than fatigue and difficulty with memory, the patient did not express any of these symptoms or concerns prior to August 2021.\n\nHer social isolation, due to her symptoms, further exacerbated her distress. She reported excessive anxiety regarding the uncertain etiology of her symptoms. She frequently expressed concern that her physicians were not doing enough to diagnose and treat her. She requested a comprehensive work-up and hospital admission. She did not meet the criteria for hospital admission and was not admitted.",

The Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) score of the patient was 30, indicating severe alcohol dependence. He had delirium tremens twice in the last 4 years. In the past, abstinence was prompted by a cultural factor (mourning of a brother) and a physical factor (pancreatitis). This time, the reason for abstinence was the COVID-19 lockdown. Following the lockdown, the patient was forced to stop alcohol due to its unavailability and inaccessibility. Due to movement constraints, family members had trouble getting treatment during the early withdrawal period. After three days of abstinence, the patient started having symptoms of agitation, decreased sleep, tremors of the hand and body, decreased awareness of the surroundings, visual hallucinations, and was hearing frightening voices. While having these symptoms, the patient tried to jump from the house (but was stopped by family members) and later inflicted a cut injury over the neck with a kitchen knife, stating that it was better to die on own than to die from others. A 3∗1 cm horizontal laceration in the anterior neck was sustained.\n\nHe was rushed to Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital (TUTH) for an emergency.

He and his family were reassured, and no medical therapy was prescribed. During the second pediatrics visit, he reported worsening anxiety, hopelessness, inattention, poor sleep, and tearfulness. He was started on escitalopram 10 mg daily. At the third visit, his symptoms had progressed further to include distorted thoughts and a fear of being alone, a fear of taking showers, racing thoughts, confusion, and intrusive thoughts. Laboratory evaluation, including a complete blood count (CBC), complete metabolic panel (CMP), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and C-reactive protein (CRP), were all within normal limits. He was continued on escitalopram and referred to counseling.\n\nFive months after his first confirmed infection with COVID-19, he presented to the ED for evaluation of significant worsening of depressive thoughts, suicidal ideation, and thoughts of hurting others. He felt that the thoughts of hurting other people belonged to someone else, describing it as “someone reaching out to me.” Laboratory evaluations of CBC, CMP, ethanol, and urinalysis drug screen (UDS) were all within normal limits or negative. His evaluation did not support an imminent threat to himself or others, and he was discharged home.\n\nSix months after his first confirmed infection with COVID-19, he returned to his pediatrician twice. He first reported additional neuropsychiatric complaints, including auditory hallucinations, derealization, cognitive slowing, and daily headaches. Laboratory evaluation of CBC, CMP, TSH, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), uric acid, and troponin were all within normal limits. Head computed tomography (CT) did not reveal any abnormalities. He and his family were reassured and encouraged to follow up with psychiatry. He returned to his pediatrician again with complaints of difficulty with thought organization, derealization, and continued cognitive slowing and again was reassured that there was no medical cause for his symptoms.\n\nNine months after his first confirmed infection with COVID-19, he presented to the ED twice within 1 week for worsening symptoms and new episodes of rage, self-injurious behavior, visual and auditory hallucinations, depression and hopelessness, lack of control of thoughts, and transient suicidal ideations. Both visits to the ED included laboratory evaluation of CBC, CMP, ethanol level, and UDS, which were all within normal range or negative. At the first ED visit, he was able to contract for safety and was discharged home. At the second ED visit, he was observed for 5 days. During this time, he did not have any additional episodes of aggression and was discharged home.\n\nNine and a half months after his first confirmed infection with COVID-19, he returned to his pediatrician with complaints of sore throat, nasal congestion, and shortness of breath. His COVID-19 PCR test was positive, indicating that he had an active COVID-19 infection for the second time. He was instructed to quarantine and was reassured that he could follow up in the outpatient setting.\n\nTen months after his first infection with COVID-19 (2 weeks after his confirmed reinfection), he presented to the pediatric ED in a neighboring city. He and his parents reported that following his reinfection with COVID-19, his symptoms worsened significantly, culminating with a self-injurious episode during which he “smashed” his face on the ground. He was transferred and admitted to our pediatric inpatient hospitalist service, at which time child and adolescent psychiatry was consulted. He reported increased severity of the previously described symptoms. He reported intrusive thoughts about violence, thoughts about his sexual orientation (having thoughts that he was homosexual although he reported that he identified as heterosexual), and gender identity, which he found distressing. An extensive workup was unremarkable. His urine drug screen 10 with confirmations was positive for marijuana metabolite of 19 ng/mL (>5 ng/mL reference range for positive), to which he reported was due to the mother and patient trying cannabidiol (CBD) oil by mouth to treat his anxiety with reported mild benefit. He remained admitted to the pediatric hospitalist service for a week, during which time provisional diagnoses included psychosis and OCD. He started sertraline daily, olanzapine before bed, and hydroxyzine as needed for anxiety. His symptoms showed minimal improvement.",

        "vignette": "A 33-year-old male presented to an outpatient psychiatric clinic for evaluation. He endorsed a history of undiagnosed anxiety, methamphetamine use, and multiple legal issues, including various forms of theft. He admitted being externally motivated to seek mental health/substance use disorder treatment because of his involvement with the justice system. However, in addition, he noted the presence of internal motivation—something that is quite new for him. He stated: “I want to do this for myself. I'm tired of living like this.” At the time of our first clinic visit, he reported that he had not used methamphetamine for the past 2 months. Prior to then, he reported using methamphetamine “whenever he could get his hands on it,” ranging from daily to weekly use. At the time of initial evaluation, he did not endorse regular cravings for stimulants. He was unemployed and resided in a sober living facility.\n\nThe patient reported having issues maintaining attention and concentration since his childhood. Previous treatment modalities include psychotherapy, but he was never prescribed medications to address his attention and concentration issues. Around this time, he began engaging in illegal behaviors, such as stealing vehicles (four-wheelers, snowmobiles, cars) in his adolescence—all the way up to semitrailers and heavy machinery (e.g., bulldozer) later in his teenage years. He endorsed a tendency to procrastinate, frequently forgetting things, and often spending excessive amounts of time double checking various things (e.g., emails, that things in his household (e.g., oven, shower) are turned off, and ensuring he has his all of his personal belongings) before leaving his residence. He also reported difficulty sitting still and interrupting others when they are busy or when he loses interest or becomes bored.\n\nHis stimulant use history began in high school. In addition, he has had periods of heavy alcohol use, which is now in sustained remission after receiving his second driving under the influence ticket and deciding to quit drinking. He regularly uses tobacco (averages one pack of cigarettes per day) and marijuana. No other substances abuse was reported.\n\nAlthough he has received various negative consequences, he denies feeling that his methamphetamine use was problematic. In fact, he cites various benefits from his use. For example, methamphetamine allows him to “feel calm,” helps “quiet racing thoughts,” and enables him to focus on specific tasks instead of “bouncing around.” Essentially, he views his methamphetamine use as a form of “self-medication” for his mental health symptoms—namely his struggles with attention and concentration but also subsyndromal anxiety and mood.",

The semiology of the seizure was such that there would be an aura-tingling sensation in limbs, ringing in ears, and fearfulness for less than a minute, followed by focal onset seizure-twisting of the upper limb and head toward left with stiffening and jerky movements of all four limbs with unconsciousness associated with tongue bite, injury due to fall and episodes also occurred during sleep. He would be confused for a few minutes after gaining consciousness, complain of headaches, and would sleep at times. He had stopped going to school for 4 years and would refuse to visit his relatives because of fear of a seizure episode. He was treated with sodium valproate up to 800 mg for a year, 2 years back with irregular follow-ups. As a few episodes of seizure occurred in-between, the family opted for treatment from traditional healers instead of medicine, and he had been noncompliant for a year. For the last 4 months, the frequency had increased to 1–3 episodes within a day.\n\nA detailed clinical evaluation was done, and he was diagnosed as a case of focal onset generalized tonic–clonic seizure and advised for baseline blood investigations, EEG, and MRI and was restarted on sodium valproate 300 mg BD with the view of using an adequate dose and optimized to 900 mg in a week. The general physical and systemic examination, blood parameters, and MRI brain were normal. EEG showed slow background activity with sharp and spike-wave complexes in both cerebral hemispheres.\n\nAfter optimizing the dose of valproate, he was seizure-free for 6 days. However, he presented to the emergency department with drowsiness, decreased alertness, lethargy, and drooling of saliva with a serum valproate level of 76 mg/L. In view of the sedating side effect of sodium valproate, the antiepileptic was changed to tablet LEV 500 mg BD. The drowsiness improved after stopping valproate and starting LEV. On the 2nd day, he started saying that he felt like going crazy. On the fourth day, he was restless, agitated, and tried to run away from the ward with delusion of persecution and auditory hallucination, second person voices commenting. The brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS) score was 34, with scores in suspiciousness, hostility, and uncooperativeness.",

When she arrived home, she dropped her phone in the toilet as X believed she was being monitored. Shortly after using the landline, X spoke with her younger sister, who noticed that she had a significant degree of incoherent speech, appeared confused, spoke about bizarre topics, and said things out of character, like making cocaine from sugar. The next day, she was expressing bizarre, sexualized ideas to her sister. Then, X went to the street and banged on car windows, so her sister immediately called emergency services. X was escorted to the emergency department (ED) for further care. At the ED, she was mechanically restrained because she was agitated, disorganized, and threatened to leave the ED. The patient at the time of admission was disoriented as to time and place and was oriented to her sister. She initially calmed down on the persuasion of her sister, however, quickly became verbally aggressive towards the physician and her sister, which according to the informant has rarely been used by the patient.

At that time, he had just been seen by a private psychiatrist and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Aside from the depressive symptoms, he also manifested with strong nihilistic delusions. He did not have any significant physical health conditions. The patient was subsequently admitted to our hospital as a case of major depressive disorder with psychotic features and treated with mirtazapine 30 mg every night, venlafaxine 150 mg every morning, and risperidone 1 mg every night. During his hospitalization, he also underwent six sessions of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and improved significantly after 2 months on the ward.\n\nUpon discharge, he was maintained on mirtazapine, venlafaxine, and risperidone for 2 years. In 2016, risperidone was discontinued. In 2018, due to his stable mood, venlafaxine was also discontinued, and he was only maintained on mirtazapine 30 mg every night. Over the years, he was continued on mirtazapine with doses fluctuating between 15 and 30 mg daily depending on the stress that he experienced at that time. He did not display any manic or hypomanic symptoms during this long period when he was only on mirtazapine. He managed to resume work as a school cleaner and continued on through the years with no significant issues. He was on 6-monthly follow-ups and had been generally compliant with his antidepressant medication.\n\nThe patient was apparently well until May 2023 when he was 71 years old. He was then brought to our hospital again by his relatives for evaluation after a change in behavior for 2 weeks. The patient was observed to have significant mood swings and was described to be very active and irritable. He was also noted to have started sending messages with grandiose content and overspending his money. He was physically aggressive toward his relatives, prompting them to bring him to our psychiatric emergency room for evaluation. During the consult, the patient's mood was observed to be labile. His thought process was largely goal directed but was noted to be interspersed with tangential and at times incoherent responses. He endorsed a decreased need for sleep, racing thoughts, and grandiose delusions. The patient did not take any illicit drugs and did not have any family history of mental illness. There were also no new medications given to him recently. Due to the acute change in his mental state, he received a comprehensive organic workup where blood examination revealed unremarkable results.",

Her childhood was notable for extensive verbal abuse and neglect from her mother, leading to untreated trauma. Three months prior to this visit, the patient was admitted to an inpatient psychiatric facility due to a 9-month history of persecutory delusions, auditory hallucinations, and blunted affect. She was diagnosed with paranoid-subtype schizophrenia and started on Haloperidol 5 mg twice a day. During her stay at the inpatient facility, she had multiple epileptic episodes; she was diagnosed with epilepsy and prescribed Lamotrigine. She initially started a dose of 25 mg once a day for 2 weeks and gradually increased to 50 mg once a day.\n\nThe patient scheduled the initial appointment for the chief concern of tremor. She described it as bilateral, occurring at rest and with action, and starting days after beginning Haloperidol. She described her schizophrenia as being well-controlled with the haloperidol and found the medication effective. Her vitals were within normal limits. Her physical exam was benign and only significant for akathisia and blunted affect. Specifically, on a neurological exam, she had intact cranial nerves I–XII, no focal sensory deficits, no motor strength deficits, and symmetric 2+/4+ deep tendon reflexes. Given the context, the tremor was likely an extrapyramidal side effect of Haloperidol. We consulted psychiatry, who recommended either decreasing the dose of haloperidol or switching to a second-generation atypical antipsychotic. The patient preferred to continue taking Haloperidol so we decreased her dose to 3 mg twice a day.\n\nDuring the same visit, the patient expressed concern that her Lamotrogine dose was “not helping” her seizures. She described her seizures as starting at the age of eight. The seizures usually occurred after stressful situations involving the patient's mother. During the episodes, the patient loses motor control and falls to the ground with bilateral arm and limb shaking. She remains conscious during the episodes. Her uncle, present at the initial visit, described the episodes similarly and relayed that she kept her eyes closed and shook her head throughout the episodes. She did not bite her tongue, express incontinence, or have postictal confusion. Most lasted between “2–4 minutes.”\n\nEven with the antiepileptic medication, the seizures continued to occur “every few weeks.” The patient was never treated for epilepsy before her inpatient stay 6 months ago. Since this visit focused on the patient's tremor, she was scheduled for a follow-up in a week regarding her seizures and told to continue to take the medications and call if she had another episode. She was also prescribed orders to draw routine labs.",

J has a history of multiple ACEs (ACE scale score of 10/10), with caregivers that were both physically and emotionally abusive when J's needs were voiced, resulting in a belief that it was unacceptable, unsafe, and futile to resolve interpersonal problems with caregivers, thus creating a sense of powerlessness and helplessness. Child and family services were never involved, and no legal charges were ever laid against the family for the abuse that J endured. J struggled with containing anger since early childhood resulting in physical and verbal aggression towards peers and teachers at school and family members at home. Caregivers attempted to contain J's aggressive behavior through forced administration of psychiatric medication. While growing up, J feared others and preferred to be alone, despite longing for family and friends. Socialization with peers proved difficult, as J was easily overwhelmed by noise associated with social contact and was frequently ridiculed or misunderstood while trying to verbally communicate.\n\nAs a young adult, J left family to enter the military, which became an immediate source of attachment and social belonging. More recently, J became increasingly unable to cope with anger following an ill-suited work position and a musculoskeletal injury, resulting in frequent angry verbal altercations and threats of violence towards military peers who placed restrictions on his activities. This led to disciplinary action and isolation from the unit, which further increased anger, hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts and led to a psychiatric military assessment. During the assessment, J disclosed feelings of intense anger which eventually manifested in an attack on a family member in an amnestic dissociated state. J's history indicated that pharmacological treatments had either been ineffective or caused significant side effects. The military psychiatrist determined J ought to be considered for military discharge. This triggered flashbacks of past childhood abuse and a significant increase in rage. J refused trials of psychiatric medications in the community due to a childhood history of forced medication administration. Due to significant safety concerns and limited ability to control aggressive behavior in the community, J's military psychiatrist referred J for an inpatient admission.\n\nOn initial assessment for admission, J appeared distrustful, angry, and concerned about acting out on anger and expressed suicidal ideation. On mental status examination, J was tall and appeared neatly dressed in a military uniform. J appeared hypervigilant and intensely watchful and was well spoken, using a “sharp” tone of voice. J provided a detailed history, demonstrating a goal-directed thought form and a high level of abstract thinking, logical analysis, and good recall. There were no delusions or hallucinations, but J endorsed prominent active suicidal ideation, with intent to act upon these thoughts if not hospitalized; however, there were no immediate, specific suicide plans.",

His prolonged psychiatric emergency department course was due to difficulty finding an available inpatient psychiatric bed at or within a reasonable radius of the receiving hospital. Per the patient's guardian, medications confirmed 6 weeks prior to admission included divalproex extended-release (ER) 500 mg twice daily, clonazepam 0.5 mg twice daily, risperidone 4 mg twice daily, risperidone microspheres long-acting injection 25 mg every 2 weeks, quetiapine 400 mg daily, and trazodone 100 mg daily. Based on the fill history and patient report, nonadherence was likely in the weeks prior to admission.\n\nLimited information was available regarding the patient's past psychiatric history, as he was a difficult historian due to his mental state at the time of the initial assessment, as noted above. From a review of available records, he was noted to have been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder in his early twenties and to have been prescribed multiple medications at various points to address manic and psychotic symptoms, including risperidone (up to 8 mg per day of the oral form and up to 25 mg every 14 days of the long-acting injectable form), quetiapine (up to 400 mg per day), and divalproex (up to 1500 mg per day). He was also prescribed trazodone for sleep (up to 50 mg per day) and sertraline for anxiety (unclear dose and duration per records). A note was made of at least partial response to risperidone and divalproex for manic and psychotic symptoms, though the durability of these effects was difficult to assess due to poor compliance. Records documented a history of over 30 psychiatric hospitalizations, usually in the setting of medication noncompliance leading to symptom relapse, with two such hospitalizations in the year prior to presentation. Mention was also made of a suicide attempt three years prior to the presentation, though the circumstances of this were unclear (the patient had reported this to an emergency room provider at an outside hospital; he denied any such history on evaluation in our psychiatric emergency room).\n\nA history of “semi-regular” use of alcohol and cannabis was also noted in his records, beginning in his early twenties, though specific amounts, frequency, adverse consequences, and any treatment for substance use were not documented. Notably, his urine toxicology screen was negative at the time of presentation to our psychiatric emergency room.\n\nMedically, a history of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (for which the patient had refused treatment with medications) was noted, with the last documented CD4 count being in the 430s range at an outside hospital one year prior to presentation.\n\nFamily history was significant for schizophrenia and suicide in a maternal uncle. In terms of social history, records indicated that the patient was an only child and that his parents separated when he was an infant; he was noted to have had no relationship with his father. He reported no history of domestic or family conflicts but also noted no current social support at the time of presentation. There was no documented history of his experiencing physical or sexual abuse, though he referred in a prior emergency room visit to a history of “verbal abuse” (unclear how long ago or by whom). He was also noted to have been married in the past but separated for 20 years prior to the presentation; he had no children. He was noted to have lived in numerous group homes over the prior ten years due to mental health issues, with frequent periods of homelessness between these stays, including for three days prior to presentation after he had absconded from his last group home due to paranoid concerns about the staff and residents there. Educationally, he was noted to have completed high school and college but to have been unemployed for ten years prior to presentation, receiving disability income, and having a guardian appointed to him due to mental health issues.\n\nPhysical examination upon initial presentation in the psychiatric emergency room was unremarkable other than the patient appearing disheveled, irritable, and guarded.

Her mental state had deteriorated progressively over the previous 12 months, following the death of her father. After a period living alone, she had returned to the family home 4 months prior to her presentation and had been noted to be socially withdrawn, preoccupied, and distractible. Her family physician, suspecting a depressive episode, had prescribed citalopram up to a dosage of 40 mg once daily, to no effect. Her family subsequently sought advice from the family physician when the patient was noted to be speaking to herself, expressing concerns about people meaning her harm, and professing the belief that she could hear other peoples’ thoughts.\n\nThe patient had been born in Sierra Leone after a complicated delivery and had traveled to the United Kingdom as a child with her family, who were fleeing from a civil war. On arrival in the United Kingdom, her family claimed asylum and moved into a small apartment in a high-rise building in central London. Although there was no reported developmental delay, she had struggled academically at school and was bullied for having overweight. She left school without qualifications at age 16 years and worked as a shop assistant. She left this job about a year prior to her referral to psychiatry after a period of sick leave following the death of her father. She was a nonsmoker, did not drink alcohol, and denied illicit drug use. A paternal relative was reported to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia. There was no comorbid physical illness.\n\nOn review, the patient was kempt and had overweight. Eye contact was fleeting, and she presented as anxious, with a degree of psychomotor agitation. Her speech was normal in rate, volume, and tone, although tangential. There was no other evidence of thought disorder. She denied feeling low in mood or suicidal and was objectively euthymic. There was some sleep disturbance, with the patient reporting being fearful to go to sleep owing to persecutory beliefs regarding her neighbors. She reflected that over the preceding few months, she had experienced a sensation of detachment from her immediate environment, as though it was not real, making her world similar to that of a video game. She reported that in the apartment where she had previously been living, she had realized that something was amiss and had become convinced that the door number of her neighbor’s flat, number 6, signified that they meant her harm. She explained this was because 6 was associated with the number of the devil. She reported hearing her neighbors commenting negatively about her appearance. These distressing experiences prompted her to return to her family home, but she continued to hear her neighbors’ voices making derogatory comments about her appearance and began to hear them commenting on her actions and thoughts in the third person as well. On returning home, her paranoia regarding her previous neighbors worsened, resulting in her rarely leaving the house. The volume and frequency of derogatory auditory hallucinations also worsened, and she reported hearing the thoughts of others as well. There was a degree of insight, and although the patient was convinced of the reality of her experiences, she also saw the stress of losing her father as associated with her experiences and was accepting of input from mental health services.",

He came to a Veterans Affairs hospital requesting buprenorphine/naloxone and complained of marital problems and job absenteeism. His TBI occurred when a roadside bomb overturned his supply truck in Afghanistan. He lost consciousness during the bombing and awoke with severe head and neck pain but no radiological brain, spine, or skull damage or focal neurological signs. He was given 20 oral morphine (5 mg) tablets and consumed them in 4 days rather than the intended 2 weeks. After finishing the morphine, he mitigated his pain with alcohol and ibuprofen (400-800 mg daily).\n\nHis opioid and ibuprofen use for TBI headaches escalated during and after his time in the military despite repeated efforts to stop by using clonidine, which relieved his withdrawal symptoms, although a rapid clonidine with naltrexone detoxification failed. After consuming a 6-week supply of morphine (5 mg) from his family physician in 3 weeks, he started receiving morphine from multiple pain physicians for about a year and buying prescription opioids from a friend. When the prescription opioids became too expensive, he started using heroin intravenously. After using heroin for about a year, he survived a respiratory arrest from overdosing with heroin mixed with fentanyl. This almost fatal overdose and persistent headaches scared him into going to a Veterans Affairs hospital, wanting buprenorphine/naloxone. His headaches had gotten worse since his injury 3 years ago, but new radiologic and neurologic examinations showed no abnormalities.",

The patient did not seek evaluation, and no additional convulsive episodes occurred during the subsequent 20 months.\nFour months before this admission, while the patient was drinking alcohol at a party, his body suddenly became stiff, and he fell backward onto a table. Shaking of the trunk, arms, and legs occurred for approximately 5 to 8 minutes. He had urinary incontinence but did not bite his tongue. Five minutes later, similar convulsions occurred. The patient was taken to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. The results of computed tomography of the head were normal, as was an electroencephalogram (EEG) that was obtained over a period of 40 minutes. Treatment with levetiracetam was started. The patient was discharged home with a recommendation for follow-up evaluation at the neurology clinic of the other hospital.\nThree months before this admission, the patient was evaluated at the neurology clinic of the other hospital. He reported that despite the use of levetiracetam, convulsions occurred approximately once per week. The results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, were reportedly normal. Treatment with lamotrigine was started. There was no change in the quality or frequency of the convulsive episodes.\nOne month before this admission, while the patient was at work, his colleagues found him on the floor, and they witnessed “shaking and clenching” movements of the trunk, arms, and legs that lasted approximately 2 minutes. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was taken to the emergency department of a second hospital for evaluation.\nAt least two additional convulsive episodes occurred at the second hospital. During one episode, the shaking movements became less intense when the physician’s hand was placed on the patient’s shoulder; the movements resumed at the previous intensity when the hand was removed. In addition, the patient’s eyes were closed. When the eyelids were opened manually, no nystagmus or gaze deviation was present. When the eyelids were released, the eyes shut forcefully and Bell’s phenomenon (upward deviation of the eyes when closing) occurred. The patient did not speak but was able to follow simple verbal commands, such as an instruction to squeeze the physician’s hands. In between the convulsive episodes, there were intermittent rocking movements of the upper body and nonrhythmic tremulous movements of the hands, and the patient did not speak or follow commands. After several hours, the episodes stopped, and the patient was able to speak. Admission to the hospital was recommended; however, the patient declined because of work obligations and anxiety about being in the hospital. He was discharged home.\nDuring the subsequent month, the patient continued to take levetiracetam and lamotrigine. However, the convulsions increased in frequency to one to three times per week.\nOn the morning before the current admission, while the patient was at work, his colleagues noticed that he abruptly stopped speaking and began to have shaking movements of the arms and legs. Emergency medical services were called. On their arrival, the patient’s body was stiff, and there was twitching of the trunk, arms, and legs. No urinary or fecal incontinence or biting of the tongue had occurred. The patient was able to stand up from a chair and walk to the ambulance. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.2°C, the blood pressure 111/56 mm Hg, the pulse 83 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was awake and alert but did not speak. His eyes were open, with a primary midline gaze and blinking in response to visual threat. His body appeared stiff, with the arms and legs straightened. There were intermittent nonrhythmic tremulous movements of the trunk, arms, and legs. The patient was able to follow complex commands and to move the arms and legs symmetrically and against gravity, but there was a delay in motor activation. The deep-tendon reflexes were normal. Extensive scarring from burns was present on the face, trunk, back, arms, and legs.\nApproximately 45 minutes after the tremulous movements had stopped, the patient was able to speak but with limited fluency. Additional history was obtained. He had been taking levetiracetam and lamotrigine as directed; however, 3 days before this evaluation, he had stopped taking these medications because he was unsure whether they were effective. That morning, he had felt well until he noticed a sharp pain in the back of his head that radiated to his neck, along with sudden blurred vision, full-body numbness, and difficulty concentrating. A convulsive episode then occurred that lasted up to 20 minutes; during the episode, the patient was aware of events but sometimes had difficulty hearing. He described his overall mood as “pretty good” and did not report decreased energy or chronic fatigue. There was no history of psychotic or manic symptoms, suicidal ideation, or obsessive or compulsive behaviors.\nThe patient had a history of a febrile seizure in childhood, as well as several concussions that had occurred while he was playing sports in childhood. He reported that during the first 6 years of life, his social supports were limited, and he had experienced maltreatment by a family member; he did not elaborate on the nature of the maltreatment. In late childhood, he was involved in a house fire and hospitalized for a prolonged period because of severe burns on the face, body, arms, and legs. He had asthma, major depressive disorder, chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and panic disorder with agoraphobia. He took escitalopram daily and lorazepam as needed for panic attacks. He was in a long-term romantic relationship. He did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs; he smoked marijuana approximately once per year and drank one alcoholic beverage per week. His father had died of heart disease when the patient was a teenager; his mother had schizoaffective disorder and post-traumatic epilepsy.\nBlood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The blood lactate level was 2.4 mmol per liter (22 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.2 mmol per liter [5 to 20 mg per deciliter]) and the blood creatine kinase level 489 U per liter (reference range, 60 to 400). Serum and urine toxicologic panels were negative. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was admitted to this hospital.",

        "vignette": "A 49-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of hypokalemia and paranoid thoughts.\nSix months before the current admission, discomfort on the right side of the chest developed, and the patient was evaluated at another hospital.\nComputed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a nodule in the upper lobe of the left lung that measured 2.1 cm by 1.9 cm, as well as bulky mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.\nAn endobronchial ultrasound–guided transbronchial needle aspiration of a mediastinal lymph node was performed. Cytologic examination of the specimen revealed small-cell carcinoma.\nFive months before the current admission, the patient sought a second opinion in the oncology clinic of this hospital. The patient was counseled about the diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer and the need for additional imaging before consideration of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy. Additional imaging was scheduled, along with a follow-up appointment. The patient did not undergo additional imaging and did not attend follow-up visits at the oncology clinic of either this hospital or the other hospital.\nSix weeks before the current admission, the patient noticed swelling of both legs. Ten days before this admission, the swelling had not abated, and he was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital.\nIn the emergency department, the patient described himself as generally healthy and did not report any chronic health conditions. He reported no fever, chills, shortness of breath, or pain. Additional history was obtained from the patient’s brother. The patient had been pursuing alternative treatment for small-cell lung cancer that included a strict diet and intravenous infusions, and he had not shared the diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer with his family until several days earlier. The patient’s brother believed that the patient was in denial about the diagnosis.\nWhen the patient was 12 years of age, he had received a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, which had been treated with radiation therapy and splenectomy. Fifteen years before this presentation, ischemic colitis had been treated with small-bowel resection. One year before this presentation, deep-vein thrombosis had been treated with a 4-month course of anticoagulation. There was no history of psychiatric disease. He took no medications and had no known drug allergies; he did not disclose details about the infusions that he had received as alternative treatment for small-cell lung cancer. The patient lived in a suburban area of New England with his parents. He was divorced and frequently visited his children. He worked part-time as a skilled tradesman. Family members reported that he was a lifelong nonsmoker.\nThe temporal temperature was 36.7°C, the blood pressure 167/95 mm Hg, the pulse 80 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The patient was alert and appeared well, but he looked thinner than he had looked during his evaluation at the oncology clinic 5 months earlier. The abdomen had a healed surgical scar, and the legs had symmetric 1+ edema. The blood potassium level was 2.6 mmol per liter (reference range, 3.6 to 5.1); the white-cell count was 14,630 per microliter (reference range, 4000 to 11,000). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Ultrasonography of the legs revealed no evidence of deep-vein thrombosis.\nCT pulmonary angiography of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a marked increase in the size of the left-lung mass, which now measured 9.3 cm by 4.6 cm, as well as enlargement of the mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed numerous new ill-defined rim-enhancing hepatic lesions, which measured up to 8.0 cm in diameter; an adrenal mass, which measured 4.1 cm by 3.4 cm; and thrombosis of the branches of the right portal vein. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was normal.\nSupplemental potassium was administered intravenously and orally, and the patient was admitted to this hospital. During the next 3 days, additional supplemental potassium was administered. During follow-up interviews, the patient acknowledged the diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer, but he did not explain why he had not shared the diagnosis with his family or provide details about the alternative treatment that he had pursued. On the fourth hospital day, the blood potassium level increased, and the patient asked to go home. He stated that he was willing to attend follow-up visits at the oncology clinic, but he was evasive when chemotherapy and immunotherapy were discussed. The patient was discharged.\nOne week after discharge, and 1 day before the current admission, the patient’s father accompanied the patient to receive massage therapy and an intravenous infusion as alternative treatment. During the infusion, the patient abruptly became volatile, agitated, and angry. On the drive home, he refused to close the window and stared into the distance. He stated that doctors had cast spells on him during his recent hospitalization and that he had killed his oldest child, which was not true.\nThe next day, the patient borrowed his brother’s car without permission and drove across the state. After he returned home, family members brought the patient to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient stated that he was “embarrassed” for being in the hospital. He initially reported no symptoms, but on specific questioning, he acknowledged fatigue, weight loss, generalized weakness, decreased appetite, and ongoing leg swelling. He reported that he did not feel confused, afraid, or worried and that he had no suicidal or homicidal thoughts or auditory or visual hallucinations. Additional history was obtained from the patient’s family members. The patient had not slept for several days. His aggressive and erratic behavior and delusions were not typical, although he could become easily angered and had a long-standing belief that his doctors had administered radiation therapy for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma to make money.\nThe temporal temperature was 36.4°C, the blood pressure 194/106 mm Hg, and the pulse 87 beats per minute. The patient alternated between being alert and lethargic, and he could state the names of his children but not their ages. He was cooperative but intermittently paused and stared; he was not distracted by external stimuli, but he seemed to be responding to internal stimuli. He spoke only a couple of words at a time and answered most questions by nodding or shaking his head. There was generalized weakness, which was most pronounced in the proximal muscle groups. The leg edema was unchanged, and the skin appeared abnormally tan; there was no scleral icterus, sublingual jaundice, or asterixis.\nThe blood potassium level was 2.2 mmol per liter, the carbon dioxide level 37 mmol per liter (reference range, 22 to 32), and the ammonia level 51 μmol per liter (87 μg per deciliter; reference range, 12 to 48 μmol per liter [20 to 82 μg per deciliter]). The white-cell count was 13,530 per microliter. Urinalysis was normal, and urine and blood toxicologic testing was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, was normal. Supplemental potassium was administered intravenously and orally, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. On the second hospital day, the blood potassium level was 2.2 mmol per liter.",

        "vignette": "A 65-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of depression, recurrent falls, and difficulty caring for herself.\nFour years before the current admission, the patient received a diagnosis of depression that was precipitated by psychosocial stressors. She was treated with bupropion, citalopram, and cognitive behavioral therapy. The depression was well controlled until 1 year before the current admission, when she began to have anhedonia, decreased energy, sadness, and poor concentration. She resumed cognitive behavioral therapy, but her symptoms worsened during the next 4 months, and she had suicidal ideation. The dose of bupropion was increased, and treatment with trazodone was started.\nFourteen weeks before the current admission, the patient was in a motor vehicle accident that was attributed to her falling asleep while driving. After the accident, she reported increased sadness, low energy, and inability to perform her usual activities. One week later, she fell and struck her head, and she was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital. She reported that, before her fall, she had been feeling unsteady because of weakness in the left leg. A physical examination was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed hypodensities involving the subcortical and periventricular white matter, findings consistent with chronic small-vessel disease. The patient was referred to the neurology clinic of this hospital and was discharged home.\nDuring the next week, the patient had balance difficulties and began using a walker. When she was evaluated in the neurology clinic, she reported imbalance and occasional nausea. On examination, she had a depressed affect. Strength was assessed as 5−/5 in the proximal and distal muscles of the arms and legs. Reflexes were 1+ and symmetric at the biceps, triceps, and patellar tendons and were absent at the ankles, with downgoing toes. The gait was wide-based and unsteady, with mild dragging of the left leg. A diagnosis of postconcussive syndrome was considered, and treatment with ondansetron was started for nausea. Additional tests were performed.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed increased signal intensity in the pons and in a periventricular distribution on T2-weighted imaging, without associated contrast enhancement. There was a region of decreased signal intensity in the right corona radiata on a map of the apparent diffusion coefficient. Results of electroencephalography were normal, as were results of electromyography and nerve-conduction studies of the left leg. Physical therapy was recommended, and repeat MRI was planned for 6 weeks later.\nOver the next 6-week period, during sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy, the patient was noted to be less talkative, with slow processing, impaired recall, and mild inattention. Repeat MRI with angiography performed 6 weeks after the first study revealed patchy hyperintensity involving the centrum semiovale, corona radiata, internal capsule, and corticospinal tract bilaterally on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging, without contrast enhancement; the cerebral vasculature was normal.\nThe patient had recurrent falls without loss of consciousness and began using a wheelchair. She reported worsening sadness, anxiety, and anhedonia, and treatment with buspirone was started. On evaluation in the neurology clinic 6 weeks before the current admission, testing of leg strength yielded inconsistent results, but strength in both legs was assessed as 5−/5 with maximum effort. Dragging of the left leg was also noted to be inconsistent. There were concerns that her depression might be contributing to her neurologic changes, and further follow-up with the psychiatric service was recommended.\nFive weeks before the current admission, the patient’s husband brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for an evaluation of worsening memory impairment, poor self-care, and frequent falls. The patient had stopped participating in physical therapy and was spending most of the day in bed. She reported that she had lost 14 kg during the previous 4 months. Other medical history included hypertension, diabetes, and osteoarthritis of the knees. There was a history of postpartum depression 27 years earlier that had lasted for several months. Medications included amlodipine, buspirone, bupropion, cholecalciferol, citalopram, metformin, and trazodone. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with her husband in a suburb of Boston and worked as a teacher. She was a lifelong nonsmoker, drank alcohol only occasionally, and did not use illicit drugs. Her mother had a history of anxiety and depression in her seventh decade of life. Her sister had a history of stroke.\nOn examination, the patient appeared tired and disheveled, with psychomotor retardation. Strength in both legs was assessed as 5/5. She had a monoplegic gait, with buckling of the left leg, when walking down a hallway, but she had a normal gait when walking on a treadmill. Her score on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment was 25, indicating mild cognitive impairment; scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function. The complete blood count, results of liver-function and kidney-function tests, and blood levels of cobalamin, thyrotropin, and electrolytes were normal. Screening for syphilis, Lyme disease, and the human immunodeficiency virus was negative, as was urine toxicologic screening. After an evaluation by a neurology consultant, the patient was voluntarily admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit.\nWhile the patient was in the hospital, the dose of citalopram was tapered, and treatment with desvenlafaxine and amphetamine–dextroamphetamine was started; her levels of attention and wakefulness increased. She participated in group psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and occupational and physical therapy. She continued to have variable weakness in the left leg and had three witnessed falls, during which she reportedly had fatigue and lowered herself to the ground.\nOn hospital day 11, the patient reported being unable to use her left arm because of weakness. Although her left arm rested across her chest for most of the day, she was observed holding her husband’s hand with her left hand when saying goodbye. On evaluation by a neurology consultant, strength in the left arm was assessed as 5/5. The working diagnosis was functional neurologic disorder. On hospital day 12, the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation center.\nAt the rehabilitation center, the patient received physical, occupational, and speech therapy, as well as medications to treat depression. During the first week, she made progress toward independence in bathing, toileting, and grooming but had limited attention, memory, and problem solving. During the second week, she became more withdrawn. There was a paucity of speech with hypophonia, decreased attention, and less eye contact with visitors who sat on her left side than with visitors who sat on her right side. During the third week, the patient stopped answering questions and following commands. She was evaluated again in the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.7°C, the blood pressure 141/90 mm Hg, the pulse 98 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was withdrawn and minimally interactive. She was able to state her name but not the date or location. She did not blink in response to threat on the left side and did not track the examiner’s finger past the midline to the left. There was flattening of the left nasolabial fold. The left arm was hypertonic and held in flexion; there was no spontaneous movement of the left arm or leg, and she declined to participate in a strength examination. She did not withdraw the left arm in response to nail-bed pressure; she withdrew the left foot with antigravity movement in response to tactile stimulation.\nThe white-cell count was 12,940 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), with a normal differential count. The remainder of the complete blood count was normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests and blood levels of electrolytes.",

        "vignette": "A 54-year-old man was evaluated by the neuropsychology service of this hospital because of irritability, confusion, and odd behaviors.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 9 months before the current evaluation, when he received a diagnosis of squamous-cell carcinoma of the tongue that had metastasized to the cervical lymph nodes. He underwent surgical dissection of the neck and resection of the tongue base on the right side, followed by adjuvant radiation therapy, which resulted in cancer remission. After treatment, neck pain and shoulder weakness developed and was attributed to postoperative neuropathy involving the right spinal accessory nerve.\nIn the context of this illness and persistent pain, the patient sought care at the cancer center behavioral medicine clinic of this hospital and received a diagnosis of adjustment disorder with depression and anxiety. During the next 8 months, the patient was seen for psychotherapy approximately every 2 weeks. Treatment for the pain included physical therapy, occupational therapy, massage therapy, acupuncture, trigger-point injections, and the use of a scapular elevation brace. Therapy with oxycodone, methadone, gabapentin, tizanidine, and duloxetine was started. Four months before the current evaluation, a sural nerve graft was placed in the right spinal accessory nerve from the proximal, functioning portion to the distal portion, but the pain and weakness did not abate.\nSix weeks before the current evaluation, the patient did not respond to telephone calls for 24 hours. The police were called and found the patient unresponsive with prescription medication bottles nearby. Emergency medical services personnel arrived, and the initial evaluation, in the patient’s home, was notable for a severely decreased respiratory rate. Naloxone was administered, the trachea was intubated, and the patient was taken to a local hospital. In the emergency department, the patient was pulseless with ongoing electrocardiographic activity. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed, and epinephrine was administered; after 4 minutes, spontaneous circulation was restored. The dose of methadone was decreased, and therapy with oxycodone, gabapentin, and tizanidine was stopped. During the subsequent 6 days, septic shock, aspiration pneumonia, acute kidney injury, and delirium occurred. When these problems resolved, the patient was discharged home.\nFive weeks before the current evaluation, the patient participated in a video follow-up evaluation at the behavioral medicine clinic. He expressed embarrassment and frustration related to his apparent accidental overdose. He described persistent depression, increased anxiety, and no other new symptoms.\nTwo weeks before the current evaluation, the patient missed a routine video follow-up evaluation at the behavioral medicine clinic, and his family was called. For the preceding 2 weeks, they had noticed that the patient was uncharacteristically agitated, irritable, talking loudly, and verbally abusive. Odd behaviors were reported. The patient had gotten lost while driving to a friend’s house that he visited frequently, had been pulled over by police for driving erratically (with normal results on a breathalyzer test), and on another occasion, had been found walking along the highway under an overpass. He called family members repeatedly in the middle of the night, and he would not answer when the calls were returned. When the family requested a police wellness check of the patient, the patient retaliated by requesting a police wellness check of the family members. After this incident, the family was advised to take the patient to a local hospital for admission.\nAt the local hospital, the patient reported no symptoms and noted that he had stopped taking methadone because he was concerned about a medication overdose. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 19, indicating cognitive impairment; scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function.1 Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a nonspecific hypodensity in the centrum semiovale on the left side. The patient was told he had mild dementia. Visiting nurse services were arranged, and the patient was discharged home.\nOne week before the current evaluation, the patient’s family reported that he had increased confusion and odd behaviors. He was unable to recall details of conversations that had happened minutes before. He could not operate the telephone or remote control and had emptied the trash can into the toilet. He had asked for his clothes to be cut off because he felt uncomfortable. Family members had been staying with the patient every night since his recent discharge because they were concerned about his safety. A neuropsychological evaluation was requested.\nThe evaluation was conducted by the cancer center neuropsychology service of this hospital with the use of videoconferencing technology to reduce the risk of exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). The patient acknowledged only minimal cognitive changes and was dismissive of the family’s concerns. A review of systems was notable for fatigue, moderate depression, mild anxiety, and difficulty sleeping and keeping track of time.\nAdditional history obtained from the patient’s family included insomnia, lumbar disk herniation, olecranon bursitis, and an inguinal hernia that had led to surgical repair in early adulthood. He had had multiple concussions as a teenager, as well as a brief loss of consciousness during a motor vehicle collision 3 years earlier. After the collision, fatigue, headaches, difficulty concentrating, and impaired memory occurred; during the subsequent 2 years, occupational therapy was provided, and the symptoms gradually resolved.\nMedications at the time of evaluation included ibuprofen, acetaminophen, duloxetine, trazodone, melatonin, polyethylene glycol, and multivitamins. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived alone in a suburban area of New England with family members nearby. He had completed a master’s degree and had had a successful career; he had taken a leave of absence from work 9 months earlier in anticipation of cancer treatment. After cancer treatment, he had been unable to return to work because of pain. He was athletic, walked 3 miles daily, and enjoyed golfing. He rarely drank alcohol and had never smoked tobacco or used illicit drugs. His family history included breast cancer and dementia in his mother, hearing loss and hypertension in his father, metastatic cancer with an unknown primary source in his paternal grandfather, glaucoma and alcohol use disorder in his maternal grandmother, and a brain tumor in a more distant relative.\nOn video neuropsychological examination, the patient was in no distress and was adequately groomed, with normal-appearing hygiene. His affect was irritable, and the fact that he reported no symptoms suggested limited insight. His spontaneous speech was fluent and well articulated. His thoughts were tangential, and he was frequently forgetful and easily distracted; his information processing speed was slow. A formal neuropsychological assessment revealed impaired executive functioning, marked by disinhibition and poor working memory, as well as deficits in recent memory, verbal fluency, and information processing speed.",

        "vignette": "A 62-year-old, left-handed man was seen in the memory disorders clinic of this hospital because of memory loss, personality changes, and odd behavior.\nApproximately 5 years before this evaluation, the patient’s wife noticed that the patient was becoming more forgetful and napped frequently during the day. She also noticed that he lacked initiative in his professional work; for example, he was not charging or collecting payments for services. The patient’s coworkers observed that he was having difficulty focusing and frequently required redirection when interacting with clients. The patient had no concerns other than intermittent mild headaches.\nDuring the next few years, the patient’s wife noticed that he became distant with family, was less talkative, and lacked interest in activities that he had previously enjoyed. He made numerous costly errors at work and also had odd behaviors. For example, he entered the kitchen of a local restaurant without permission; on another occasion, he inadvertently borrowed a vehicle from a colleague without first notifying that person. In another instance, while the patient’s vehicle was stopped for a routine traffic infraction, he became irritable and briefly evaded police, incurring several legal violations.\nOne year before this evaluation, the patient was seen in the neurology and psychiatry clinics of another hospital at his wife’s request. He had no concerns about his neurocognitive state. He noted that he was sleeping as little as 2 to 3 hours per night but had a good energy level. He reported intermittent mild headaches. He had no sinus pain, numbness, tingling, or constitutional symptoms. On examination, the patient was alert and oriented, with some inattention and confabulation. The remainder of the neurologic examination was normal. A complete blood count and blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were results of tests of kidney, liver, and thyroid function. Tests for antinuclear antibodies and for Lyme disease were negative. The patient received diagnoses of attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder, adjustment disorder, and avoidant personality traits. Psychotherapy was initiated, and melatonin and dextroamphetamine–amphetamine were prescribed.\nThe patient had ongoing personality changes and difficulties with organization and daily functioning, and he was evaluated in the memory disorders clinic of this hospital at his wife’s request. She reported that dextroamphetamine–amphetamine had not improved his overall organizational abilities. Although he was physically capable of conducting activities of daily living, he required prompting to perform tasks to maintain basic hygiene, such as bathing. He no longer participated in the management of family finances; he was unable to maintain employment and was receiving disability payments. He had new odd behaviors, such as urinating in public on a few occasions and frequently and unexpectedly visiting family members’ workplaces and neighbors’ homes at late hours. He also had obsessive behaviors, such as calling his children multiple times to confirm details before a scheduled gathering. The patient was unaware of his inappropriate and unusual behaviors. He did not report having anxiety, depression, or perceptual disturbances.\nApproximately 10 years before the current evaluation, the patient had received a diagnosis of Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia. Because he was asymptomatic, treatment was deferred. Two years before the current evaluation, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed for disease surveillance. There were multiple enlarged hilar and retrocrural lymph nodes, measuring up to 1.2 cm in greatest dimension, with no evidence of organomegaly or focal osseous lesions. The patient attended routine oncology appointments for disease monitoring. Two months before the current evaluation, a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel were normal. The blood IgM level was 2850 mg per deciliter (reference range, 40 to 230), and the β2-microglobulin level 2.8 mg liter (reference range, 0 to 2.7); these values had been stable since the diagnosis of Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia was established.\nOther medical history included mitral regurgitation, nephrolithiasis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, bilateral knee osteoarthritis, and spinal stenosis. There was no history of head trauma, stroke, or seizure. Medications included a multivitamin and fish oil; there were no known allergies to medications. The patient did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. He lived with his wife, and his daughters and grandchildren lived nearby. He had graduated from high school and trade school before serving in the navy for 2 years; he did not serve in a combat role or have known exposure to toxins. Both of his parents had heart disease, a sister had depression, and a maternal uncle had throat cancer. There was no family history of dementia, neurologic disorders, or psychiatric disorders.\nOn examination, the patient was well groomed, pleasant, and cooperative. Physical appearance was normal. His Mini–Mental State Examination score was 23 on a scale ranging from 0 to 30 (with higher scores indicating better cognitive function), and his Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score was 15 on a scale ranging from 0 to 30 (with higher scores indicating better cognitive function).\nOrientation was intact except for an error in recalling the date. On testing of attention, the patient had difficulty with serial sevens calculations and with the digit-span test, in which a sequence of numbers is read by the examiner and repeated by the patient; he repeated only four digits of the forward span correctly. On testing of memory, he repeated five out of five words after two trials and did not spontaneously recall any of the words after 5 minutes; he recalled three of the words when selecting from a written list of word choices. Spontaneous speech production was diminished. On testing of confrontation naming, he identified a camel when shown a picture of a giraffe. On testing of semantic and phonemic fluency, he spontaneously generated six animal names over a 1-minute period, as well as one word that begins with the letter “F” over a 1-minute period. The clock-drawing test showed good organization. The letter–number sequencing test (also known as the alternating trail-making test) revealed impaired set shifting, and Luria’s three-step test revealed impaired motor sequencing. On testing of verbal abstraction, when the patient was asked to describe how a train and a bicycle are similar, he stated, “A train is bigger than a bicycle and would crush the bicycle.” Judgment and insight were markedly impaired.\nAn evaluation of cranial nerve function, sensation, power, bulk, tone, coordination, and gait was normal. Deep-tendon reflexes were normal, and the toes were downgoing bilaterally. Bilateral grasp reflexes and palmomental reflexes were present. Testing for syphilis was negative. The blood folate level was 8.2 ng per milliliter (19 nmol per liter; reference range, >4.7 ng per milliliter [11 nmol per liter]), and the vitamin B12 level 258 pg per milliliter (190 pmol per liter; reference range, >231 pg per milliliter [170 pmol per liter]).\nOn neuropsychological assessment, social engagement was limited, with a few moments of giggling that was incongruent with the context. Spontaneous speech was fluent but impoverished. There was frequent use of the word “thing” to replace lower-frequency words and periodic use of phonemic paraphasias such as “a fenco type of thing.” Thoughts were coherent but impoverished, tangential, and perseverative. Attention and executive functioning were markedly impaired during assessments of verbal fluency, divided attention, abstract reasoning, and inhibitory control. Visual memory was relatively intact, but verbal memory was impaired in terms of encoding and retrieval. When the patient was asked to describe an image, written language was severely impaired but oral language was relatively intact.",

He had been having an ongoing “depressive episode” during the past 3 months, which had led him to call in sick to work frequently. He had passive suicidal ideation, questioning whether life was worth living; however, he had no specific intent or plan and no thoughts of harming other people. The patient had a history of nightmares, but they had not occurred during the past 3 months. In the 3 years before this evaluation, his startle response had been increased and flashbacks frequently occurred; however, at the time of the evaluation, his startle response was reduced and there were no flashbacks. He reported that women had attempted to poison his coffee. There were no auditory or visual hallucinations. He reported limited energy, difficulty initiating sleep, repeated early morning awakenings, and anorexia. There was no weight loss, difficulty concentrating, or history of headaches, seizure, or head trauma.\nThe patient’s medical history included diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, seasonal allergies, mild intermittent asthma, eczema, and chronic lower back pain associated with a motor vehicle accident that had occurred 20 years earlier. Medications included bupropion, quetiapine, aspirin, atorvastatin, ezetimibe, amlodipine, fosinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, metformin, and vitamins B12 and D3, as well as fexofenadine, naproxen, sildenafil, and inhaled albuterol as needed. Adverse drug effects included dry and painful mouth with paroxetine, reduced libido with paroxetine and citalopram, orthostatic hypotension and falls with prazosin, nausea and vomiting with lisinopril, and elevated aminotransferase levels with statins.\nThe patient had a family history of dyslipidemia; his brother had died of premature myocardial infarction, and his father had undergone coronary-artery bypass grafting. He had an adult child, who was healthy. There was no history of neuropsychiatric disease or substance use disorder in first-degree relatives, but male maternal cousins had major depressive disorder and schizophrenia. He worked full-time as a counselor. He visited a psychic every few weeks and was undergoing training to become a psychic and read tarot cards. He had formerly smoked a few cigarettes daily and had quit smoking when he was 30 years of age. He drank one alcoholic beverage on weekend nights and did not use illicit drugs.\nThe patient grew up in Haiti. His parents were devout Catholics, but many community members and relatives observed Vodou and Santeria beliefs and also practiced tarot card reading; the patient and his siblings began following Vodou and Santeria practices during adolescence. In his early life, the patient witnessed an act of police brutality in which a community member was killed, as well as the poisoning of colleagues of his father, who was a government employee. In his early adulthood, the patient immigrated to the United States. He lived in an urban area of New England, where he completed college and then worked as a counselor. He reported that he had experienced recurrent discrimination by female supervisors during his employment. In his early years of working, he encountered financial difficulties and was evicted from his apartment. During a 2-month period of homelessness, he became a victim of sexual and physical assault and subsequently had depressive symptoms, flashbacks, nightmares, and intrusive thoughts of the assault. He reported that he had not had any psychiatric symptoms before the assault.\nThe patient was married for a brief period and then divorced. He reported that his ex-wife had “put a Vodou curse on me” and that he had traveled to Haiti to have the curse removed but “the damage cannot be undone.” For decades, he feared that female coworkers would try to poison him. For this reason, he did not drink coffee that had been unattended in the office, did not accept offers from coworkers to bring him coffee from a local shop, and avoided eating with colleagues. He felt that people at work did not like him. He described extreme self-consciousness and was concerned that people in either a professional or social setting would see “discoloration” when they looked at his face.\nIn his early adulthood, the patient had sought weekly therapy at another hospital because of depressive symptoms, intrusive thoughts, and nightmares. Four years before the current consultation, and again 1 year later and 18 months after that, he sought care at psychiatry clinics at other hospitals. Meanwhile, he continued to receive care from the same therapist for approximately three decades.\nAdditional history was obtained from the patient’s therapist. The persecutory beliefs had been long-standing, occurring over a period of decades; they became more prominent when depressive symptoms were more active, but they were still present during periods of euthymia. The therapist observed that the patient’s persecutory beliefs affected interpersonal relationships and led to the feeling of isolation at work.\nThe patient had undergone multiple trials of psychopharmacologic medications for the treatment of recurrent major depressive episodes, which would occur approximately two times each year and last for several weeks to months. These medications included nortriptyline, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine, citalopram, escitalopram, bupropion, and valproic acid. He had tried prazosin, which decreased the frequency of nightmares but was discontinued owing to orthostatic hypotension. He had undergone EMDR (eye movement, desensitization, and reprocessing) therapy, but nightmares occurred up to three times per month and intrusive thoughts of the sexual trauma occurred daily. Olanzapine and aripiprazole did not reduce paranoid thoughts; quetiapine had a modestly beneficial effect.\nOn examination, the patient was a well-groomed older man with no abnormal facial features. His posture and gait were normal. He was calm and cooperative, with normal eye contact and speech of an appropriate rate and volume. He was oriented to time, place, and situation, with intact attentiveness and ability to recall autobiographical and historical information. His mood was described as mildly sad and anxious with a constricted affect. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.\nOn laboratory testing performed at another hospital during the 6 months before the current evaluation, the complete blood count and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were levels of electrolytes, thyrotropin, and folate. The glucose level was 131 mg per deciliter (7.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]). The glycated hemoglobin level (7.0%; reference range, 4.3 to 6.4) had increased from a level of 6.4% obtained 6 months earlier. An electrocardiogram obtained 4 months before the current evaluation showed sinus rhythm with a normal corrected QT interval.",

        "vignette": "A 32-day-old male infant was transferred to the emergency department and admitted to this hospital for evaluation of suspected abusive head trauma.\nOn the evening of admission, the patient’s mother called emergency medical services and reported that the patient had fallen. The mother reported that the infant had been well until that evening, when she placed him on her bed before briefly stepping a short distance away to warm up a bottle of formula in the microwave. She heard a thud and then returned to find that the baby had fallen less than 1 m (2 to 3 ft) from the bed to the hardwood floor, where he was lying face down and crying. She picked him up immediately to console him. After continuing to cry for several minutes, the patient suddenly became quiet; this behavior was worrisome to the mother and prompted her to call for emergency medical assistance. During the phone call, the baby resumed crying. On arrival of emergency medical services personnel several minutes later, the infant appeared well and was bottle-feeding without difficulty; there were no signs of injury. He was transported by ambulance to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation.\nAt the other hospital, the patient’s mother reported that the baby had not lost consciousness or vomited during the event and was behaving normally. On examination, the patient was alert, regarded the examiner, cried when he was undressed, and calmed when he was swaddled. The vital signs were normal. The head was normocephalic and atraumatic. There were no bruises or subconjunctival hemorrhages, and results of abdominal, musculoskeletal, and neurologic examinations were normal, as was the remainder of the physical examination.\nComputed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed scattered punctate densities in the right and left superior occipital lobes, a density (3 mm in diameter) extending along the left tentorial leaflet, mild prominence of both opercula, and mild diffuse prominence of the extraaxial spaces.\nA report of suspected abusive head trauma was filed with the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families, and the patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.\nOn arrival at this hospital, a history was obtained from the patient’s mother. The patient was born at another hospital after 37 weeks of gestation; labor was induced because of maternal preeclampsia, and the infant was delivered vaginally. At delivery, a nuchal cord was unwrapped from the baby’s neck. He received routine newborn care and was feeding and growing well. Two weeks before the current evaluation, he was seen in the emergency department of the first hospital because of three episodes of vomiting; abdominal ultrasonography performed during that visit did not reveal findings consistent with pyloric stenosis. During the 10 to 14 days before the current evaluation, the patient was fussy. He had a diaper rash, for which his pediatrician prescribed topical nystatin; in addition, his mother was applying a zinc oxide–containing cream to the rash. He took no other medications and had no known allergies. His mother had a history of asthma, post-traumatic stress disorder, and anxiety; she had placed frequent calls to emergency medical services because of concerns about her health but was often reassured by the responding personnel and not transported to a hospital. Both of the patient’s maternal grandparents had a history of substance use disorder, and his maternal grandmother had died of a heroin overdose.\nThe patient lived with his mother in housing funded by the Department of Mental Health. They were visited each week by a case manager and received social support from an aunt. The patient’s mother was a high school graduate and was certified as an emergency medical technician; she had been in the custody of the Department of Children and Families during adolescence and had a 2-year-old daughter who had been placed with the aunt at the recommendation of the Department of Children and Families because of concerns about the mother’s mental health issues. Although the case involving the daughter was closed, the mother reported that she still had contact with her former social worker, who continued to provide support. The pregnancy with the patient was unplanned and occurred near the beginning of the mother’s relationship with the father of the baby; this relationship was characterized by young age and intimate-partner violence, and the couple separated before the birth of the infant. The mother was the patient’s primary caregiver, although on two occasions (the most recent one occurring 6 days before this evaluation), the baby had spent time with his father.\nOn examination, the patient was alert and vigorous and appeared well. The temperature was 36.6°C, the pulse 161 beats per minute, the blood pressure 86/50 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 56 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 3.99 kg (18th percentile), the length 53 cm (17th percentile), and the head circumference 35 cm (2nd percentile). There were no exterior signs of facial or scalp trauma, and the anterior fontanelle was soft and flat. An intraoral examination did not reveal lesions; the lingual frenulum was intact. The abdomen was soft, without distention, tenderness, or masses. Examination of the skin revealed scattered skin-colored papules (1 mm in diameter) on the chest and face, a crescent-shaped erythematous patch above the right nipple, a blanching erythematous macule (3 mm in diameter) on the left buttock, erythema of the intergluteal cleft, and a scratch (3 mm by 2 mm) behind the left knee. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and additional imaging studies were obtained.\nSusceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), performed 16 hours after the head CT, revealed a lobular focus of hemorrhage (15 mm by 2 mm) in the right superior occipital gyrus that was probably chronic and corresponded to the 2-mm punctate density seen on non–contrast-enhanced CT. A similar focus of hemorrhage in the left superior occipital gyrus was also probably chronic. A focus of hemorrhage in the right caudothalamic groove and two foci of hemorrhage or mineralization (3 mm in diameter) in the bilateral choroid plexuses were also seen.",

        "vignette": "A 16-year-old girl was seen in the sports concussion clinic at this hospital because of headache, dizziness, balance problems, fatigue, irritability, and difficulties with sleep and concentration after she had head trauma during a sailboat race.\nThe patient had been well until 11 days before this evaluation, when she was racing in a regatta and was struck in the head by the boom of another team’s boat. On collision, her team’s boat capsized. The patient was reportedly dazed and confused, but she was assisted back into the boat by her teammates and they continued to sail. Shortly thereafter, the weather became windy and the patient and her teammates were again knocked out of the boat. The patient reportedly lost consciousness for several minutes; it was suspected but not confirmed that she had been hit by the boom of her team’s boat. She was rescued and brought to shore. On arrival of emergency medical services personnel, she was awake and talking but confused. She was transported by ambulance to the emergency department at another hospital. During the ambulance ride, she was agitated and resisted care.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported that she felt confused, dizzy, and unsteady and had a headache. The results of a neurologic examination and an examination of the neck were reportedly normal, as were radiographs of the cervical spine. Rest and observation were recommended, and the patient was discharged home in the care of her parents.\nEleven days later, the patient was seen in the sports concussion clinic at this hospital. She did not remember the sailing accident or the subsequent ambulance ride. Since discharge, she had been resting at home with limited activity and stimulation. She had occasional frontotemporal headaches with sharp pain, which she rated at 3 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. She also reported dizziness, balance problems, fatigue, and difficulty sleeping. The patient noted that she had had difficulty concentrating on her summer reading assignment and could not read a full page without losing focus, although she could read less challenging material for 15-to-20-minute intervals. Reading precipitated headaches. She reported that she felt irritable and impatient with having to stay home and that her symptoms decreased with activity.\nThe patient had a history of several sports-related injuries. When she was 13 years of age, she had a concussion without loss of consciousness after being hit in the head with a paddleboard. After that injury, she was dizzy for several days and had headaches for 3 months. The patient took no medications and had no known allergies. She lived with her parents and brother in a suburban area of New England and was an excellent student. Her brother had attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). There was no family history of headaches, learning disabilities, depression, anxiety, or seizure disorders.\nOn examination, the patient was alert and answered questions appropriately. On a mental-status examination, orientation, immediate and delayed recall, attention, and language were intact. The neck was not tender and had a full range of motion. Cranial nerves II through XII were normal, and there was no nystagmus. Photophobia was present, and there was pain with upward gaze; the near point of convergence was 15 cm. Both nodding and side-to-side movements of the head caused dizziness. On a Romberg test, the patient swayed mildly when she stood with her feet together and eyes closed. There were mild difficulties with double-leg, single-leg, and tandem stance on a hard surface. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.",

        "vignette": "Ashley, age 17, was referred for a diagnostic reevaluation after having carried diagnoses of autism and intellectual disability for almost all of her life. She was recently found to have Kleefstra syndrome, and the family wanted to reconfirm the earlier diagnoses and assess the genetic risk to the future children of her older sisters.\n\nAt the time of the reevaluation, Ashley was attending a special school with a focus on functional skills. She was able to dress herself, but she was not able to shower independently or be left alone in the house. She was able to decode (e.g., read words) and spell at a second-grade level but understood little of what she read. Changes to her schedule and heightened functional expectations tended to make her irritable. When upset, Ashley would often hurt herself (e.g., biting her wrist) and others (e.g., pinching and hair pulling).\n\nIn formal testing done at the time of the reevaluation, Ashley had a nonverbal IQ of 39 and a verbal IQ of 23, with a full scale IQ of 31. Her adaptive scores were somewhat higher, with an overall score of 42 (with 100 as average).\n\nBy history, Ashley first received services at age 9 months after her parents noticed significant motor delays. She walked at 20 months and was toilet trained at 5 years. She spoke her first word at age 6. She received a diagnosis of developmental delay at age 3 and of autism, obesity, and static encephalopathy at age 4. An early evaluation noted possible facial dysmorphology; genetic tests at that time were noncontributory.\n\nHer parents indicated that Ashley knew hundreds of single words and many simple phrases. She had long been very interested in license plates and would draw them for hours. Her strongest skill was memory, and she could draw precise representations of license plates from different states. Ashley had always been very attached to her parents and sisters, and although affectionate toward babies, she showed minimal interest in other teenagers.\n\nAshley’s family history was pertinent for a father with dyslexia, a paternal uncle with epilepsy, and a maternal male cousin with possible “Asperger’s syndrome.” Her siblings, both sisters, were in college and doing well.\n\nOn examination, Ashley was an overweight young woman who made inconsistent eye contact but often peered out the corner of her eye. She had a beautiful smile and would sometimes laugh to herself, but most of the time her facial expressions were subdued. She did not initiate joint attention by trying to catch another person’s eyes. She frequently ignored what others would say to her. To request a preferred object (e.g., a shiny magazine), Ashley would rock from foot to foot and point. When offered an object (e.g., a small decorated box), she brought it to her nose and lips for inspection. Ashley spoke in a high-pitched voice with unusual intonation. During the interview, she used multiple words and a few short phrases that were somewhat rote but communicative, such as “I want to clean up,” and “Do you have a van?”\n\nIn the months prior to the evaluation, Ashley’s parents noticed that she had become increasingly apathetic. A medical evaluation concluded that urinary tract infections were the most likely cause for her symptoms, but antibiotics seemed only to make her more listless. Further medical evaluation led to more extensive genetic testing, and Ashley was diagnosed with Kleefstra syndrome, a rare genetic defect associated with multiple medical problems, including intellectual developmental disorder. The parents said they were also tested and found to “be negative.”\n\nThe parents specifically wanted to know whether the genetic testing results affected Ashley’s long-standing diagnoses and access to future services. Furthermore, they wanted to know whether their other two daughters should get tested for their risk of carrying genes for autism, intellectual disability, and/or Kleefstra syndrome.",

        "vignette": "Brandon was a 12-year-old boy brought in by his mother for psychiatric evaluation for temper tantrums that seemed to be contributing to declining school performance. The mother became emotional as she reported that things had always been difficult but had become worse after Brandon entered middle school. Shortly after starting middle school, Brandon had started complaining of stomachaches on school-day mornings and was often reluctant to go to school.\n\nBrandon’s sixth-grade teachers reported that he was academically capable but that he had little ability to make friends. He seemed to mistrust the intentions of classmates who tried to be nice to him but attempted to befriend others who laughingly feigned interest in the toy cars and trucks that he brought to school. The teachers noted that he often cried and rarely spoke in class. In recent months, multiple teachers had heard him screaming at other boys, generally in the hallway but sometimes in the middle of class. The teachers had not identified a cause but generally had not disciplined Brandon because they assumed he was responding to provocation. He was embarrassed about these outbursts and did not want to go to swim practice because he did not want his swim friends to ask why he’d had an outburst at school.\n\nWhen interviewed alone, Brandon responded with nonspontaneous mumbles when asked questions about school, classmates, and his family. When the examiner asked if he was interested in toy cars, however, Brandon lit up. He pulled several cars, trucks, and airplanes from his backpack and, while not making good eye contact, did talk at length about vehicles, using their apparently accurate names (e.g., front-end loader, B-52, Jaguar). When asked again about school, Brandon pulled out his cell phone and showed a string of text messages: “dumbo!!!!” “mr stutter”; “LoSeR”; “freak!”; “EVERYBODY HATES YOU.” While the examiner read the long string of texts that Brandon had saved but apparently not previously revealed, Brandon added that other boys would whisper “bad words” to him in class and then scream in his ears in the hall. “And I hate loud noises.” He also told the examiner that he sometimes wished that he had never been born.\n\nDevelopmentally, Brandon spoke his first word at age 11 months and began to use short sentences by age 3. He had always been very focused on trucks, cars, and trains. According to his mother, he had always been “very shy” and had never had a best friend. As he has gotten older, it has become more apparent that he struggles with jokes and typical young adolescent banter because “he takes things so literally.” Brandon’s mother had long seen this behavior as “a little odd” but added that it was not much different from that of Brandon’s father, a successful attorney, who had similarly focused interests. Both of them were “sticklers for routine” who “lacked a sense of humor.” Brandon’s mother noted that he made efforts to conceal his interest in trucks, cars, and trains outside of the home but would eagerly speak about them when encouraged. Brandon has shared with his mother that he tries to appear “normal” when interacting with peers at school, which is exhausting. He often feels nervous around peers and generally tries to avoid socializing.\n\nOn examination, Brandon was shy and generally nonspontaneous. He made below-average eye contact. His speech was coherent and goal directed. At times, Brandon stumbled over his words, paused excessively, and sometimes rapidly repeated words or parts of words. Brandon said he felt okay but added that he was scared of school, particularly when around other children. He appeared sad, brightening only when discussing his toy cars. He denied current suicidal thoughts or plans as well as homicidality. He denied psychotic symptoms. He was cognitively intact.",

        "vignette": "Carlos was a 19-year-old Hispanic college student in his freshman year at a public university in a large city. He was referred by his guidance counselor to the hospital’s outpatient psychiatric clinic for help with academic difficulties. Since starting college 6 months earlier, he had done poorly on tests and been unable to manage his study schedule. His worries that he was going to flunk out of college were leading to anxiety, insomnia, poor concentration, and a general sense of hopelessness. After a particularly tough week, he told his family that he thought he should quit. His mother accompanied him to the clinic that had previously helped both Carlos and his younger brother. The mother specifically wondered whether Carlos’s “ADHD” might be causing his problems, or whether he had outgrown it.\n\nCarlos had been seen at the same clinic when he was age 9, at which time he had been diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), predominantly combined type. Notes from that clinical evaluation indicated that Carlos had been in trouble at school for not following instructions, not completing homework, getting out of his seat, losing things, not waiting his turn, and not listening. He had trouble concentrating except in regard to video games, which he “could play for hours.” Carlos had apparently been slow to talk, but his birth and developmental histories were otherwise normal. He repeated first grade because of behavioral immaturity and difficulty learning to read. The ease with which Carlos learned English, his second language, was not noted. His family had emigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic when he was 5 years old. The family was Catholic and attended church every Sunday. Both of his parents worked in maintenance and housekeeping at a local municipal hospital.\n\nDuring the evaluation when Carlos was age 9, a psychoeducational assessment by a clinical psychologist confirmed reading problems (particularly problems in reading fluency and comprehension). Carlos did not, however, meet the school board criteria for a learning disability, which required evidence of a 20-point discrepancy between IQ and achievement scores. Thus, he was not eligible for special education services. The evaluator had noted Carlos to be eager to do well and anxious about underperforming. His anxiety was thought to be a reaction to his school difficulties and his challenges in meeting the academic expectations of his family. Carlos’s pediatrician had recommended pharmacotherapy, but his parents did not want to pursue medication. They cited negative experiences with local youth who used diverted controlled substances and hung out “on the street.” Instead, his mother reported taking on an extra job to pay for tutors to help her son “with concentration and reading.” The eldest of four siblings, Carlos had done well with this intervention and was now the first member of his family to attend college.\n\nThe psychiatry trainee carefully reviewed Carlos’s academic history; his symptoms, including the course and severity of sadness, anxiety, insomnia, and hopelessness; and his social and developmental history. She obtained collateral history from his family and school records. She used the revised DSM-5-TR Core Cultural Formulation Interview for assistance in obtaining a better understanding of Carlos’s acculturation experiences, the family’s past feelings about the clinic’s recommendations, and what treatment interventions would be relevant and acceptable to Carlos and his family.\n\nThe psychiatry trainee learned that Carlos had a childhood history of “nervousness” identified by a neighborhood curandera (traditional healer) as ataque de nervios. The family had addressed this problem with supportive prayer and a traditional herbal tea. They had apparently not revealed this to the psychiatrist at the time, thinking he would find it irrelevant and not wishing to seem disrespectful of his authority. During these unrevealed episodes of acute anxiety, Carlos would experience trembling and agitation, palpitations, shortness of breath, dread of harm, and fear of separation from caregivers. Workup by the pediatrician had revealed no physiological cause.\n\nSince starting college, Carlos reported that he had frequently been unable to remain focused while reading and listening to lectures. He was easily sidetracked and therefore had difficulty handing in his written assignments on time. He complained of feeling restless, agitated, and worried. He described difficulty falling asleep, poor energy, and an inability to “have fun” like his peers. He reported that the depressive symptoms went “up and down” over the course of the week and possibly influenced his problems with concentration; it was hard for him to be certain. He denied substance use.\n\nCarlos said that he’d had some great teachers in high school who had understood him, helped him get the meaning of what he read, and allowed him to audiotape lectures and use other formats (e.g., videos, wikis, visual presentations) for final assignments. Without this support at college, he said he felt “lonely, stupid, a failure—unable to cope.”\n\nAlthough advised by his high school teacher to do so, Carlos had not registered with the university’s student disability services office. He preferred not to be seen as different from his peers and thought he should be able to get through college by himself.\n\nCarlos’s family history was positive for ADHD in a younger brother. A cousin was reported to have had “dyslexia” and had dropped out of a local community college after one semester. His social and developmental history revealed that he had been well liked by his cluster of friends throughout school. His group consisted of boys and girls and tended to consist of kids more interested in school than in sports. Carlos denied ever having dated or been sexually active, and he also denied having any significant interest in pursuing either of these activities.\n\nOn examination, Carlos was well-groomed, polite, and soft-spoken. He wore clean jeans, a T-shirt, and a hoodie that he kept pulling down over his face. He sat quietly and hunched over. He sighed a lot and rarely made eye contact with the clinician. He often tapped his fingers and shuffled in his seat but responded appropriately to questions. His command of English appeared strong, but he spoke with a slight Spanish accent. He often mumbled and mispronounced some multisyllabic words (e.g., he said “literalchure” instead of “literature” and “intimate” when he clearly meant “intimidate”). He denied any suicidal thoughts. He appeared motivated to do better. On a follow-up interview with the psychiatry trainee, Carlos asked whether the conversations were confidential. When informed that they were, he hesitantly admitted that he felt overwhelmed by new relationships with college peers. He indicated that “in my neighborhood growing up, everybody was Dominican, but in college, I’m the only Dominican.” He also quietly said that he thought he might “like guys rather than girls.” He revealed two recent episodes of panic “like when I was a kid” that had occurred during social situations. He declined to go into further detail.\n\nAfter these two initial sessions, the psychiatrist suggested extending the evaluation so that they could optimize a treatment strategy. She told Carlos that she wanted to better understand his mood and anxiety symptoms, as well as how he felt about being the first in his family to go to college (i.e., role transitions), and to talk a little more about his concerns about his sexual orientation. She also referred Carlos for updated psychoeducational testing. This psychoeducational reassessment confirmed that Carlos’s reading and writing abilities were substantially and quantifiably below those expected for his age. That report also concluded that these learning difficulties were not attributable to intellectual developmental disorder, uncorrected visual or auditory acuity, psychosocial adversity, or lack of proficiency in the language of academic instruction. The report concluded that Carlos had specific difficulties with reading fluency and comprehension as well as spelling and written expression.",

        "vignette": "Daphne, a 13-year-old in the ninth grade, was brought for a psychiatric evaluation because of academic and behavioral struggles. She had particular difficulty starting and completing schoolwork and following instructions, and she had received failing grades in math. When prompted to complete tasks, Daphne became argumentative and irritable. She had become increasingly resistant to attending school, asking to stay home with her mother. These difficulties had been evident since early childhood but had worsened significantly this year. Because Daphne had become increasingly distressed, her parents have been less insistent on making her do any activity that upsets her.\n\nPsychological testing indicated that Daphne had above-average intelligence, age-appropriate achievement in all subjects except math, and some difficulties in visuospatial skills. The test results were shared with the school, which offered additional tutoring. Daphne attended only a few sessions, stating that they were not helpful. Her parents talked to the school counselors and Daphne’s teachers, asking for more services. They were told repeatedly that Daphne needed to be more assertive and ask for help. Several teachers commented that Daphne should be more motivated and try harder. Several years earlier, her pediatrician had diagnosed ADHD and prescribed a stimulant. She took the medication for a week, but her parents stopped giving it to her because she seemed agitated.\n\nAt home, Daphne’s parents’ close supervision of her homework often led to arguments with crying and screaming. Her behavior and attitude were noticeably better when she was out of school. She had two long-standing friends but had made no new close friends for several years. In groups with other children, she preferred to play with those younger than she. When her friends chose the activity or did not follow her rules, she tended to withdraw. She was generally quiet in groups and in school but more interactive with family members and individuals she knew well.\n\nSince early childhood, Daphne has had difficulty falling asleep, requiring a nightlight and parental reassurance. Recognizing that Daphne was easily upset by change, her parents rarely forced her into new activities. She did well during the summer, which she spent with her grandparents. Her parents reported no particular traumas, stressors, or developmental or medical problems. Daphne had started her menses about 2 months prior to the evaluation. Her family history was pertinent for multiple first- and second-degree relatives with mood, anxiety, or learning disorders.\n\nAt first meeting, Daphne was shy and tense. Her eye contact was poor, and she had difficulty talking about anything other than her plastic horse collection. Within 15 minutes, she became more comfortable, revealing that she disliked school because the work was too hard. She thought that other children did not seem to like her because she was stupid and was not into clothes and dating. Sometimes they made fun of her and would start laughing whenever the teacher called on her. There were several peers who had similar interests in animals and seemed okay. She has been eating lunch with them but found it hard to relax and to believe that they really wanted to be friends. Daphne was always afraid of making mistakes, getting bad grades, and disappointing everyone. Often, she was so preoccupied with what to say or do next that she did not pay attention to her peers or teachers. She frequently was unable to make a decision for fear of not being right. Daphne was unable to identify any personal strengths or any aspect of her life that was going well. She wished she had more friends and that she was smarter. As long as she could remember, she had always felt this way. These difficulties made her sad, but she denied persistent depressive feelings or suicidal thoughts. She appeared anxious but brightened when discussing her horse figurine collection, her longtime friends, and her family.",

        "vignette": "Felicia Allen was a 32-year-old single woman brought to the emergency room (ER) by police after she apparently tried to steal a city bus in Chicago. Because she appeared to be an “emotionally disturbed person,” a psychiatry consultation was requested.\n\nAccording to the police report, Ms. Allen threatened the driver with a knife, took control of the almost empty city bus, and crashed it. A more complete story was elicited from a friend of Ms. Allen’s who had been on the bus but who had not been arrested. According to her, they had boarded the bus on their way to a nearby shopping mall. Ms. Allen became frustrated when the driver refused her dollar bills, instead demanding exact change. She looked in her purse, but instead of finding exact change, she pulled out a kitchen knife that she carried for protection. The driver fled, so she got into the empty seat and drove the bus across the street into a nearby parked car.\n\nOn examination, Ms. Allen was a handcuffed, heavyset young woman with a bandage on her forehead. She fidgeted and rocked back and forth in her chair. She appeared to be mumbling to herself. When asked what she was saying, the patient made momentary eye contact and just repeated, “Sorry, sorry.” She did not respond to other questions.\n\nMore information was elicited from a psychiatrist who had come to the ER soon after the accident. He said that Ms. Allen and her friend were longtime residents at the state psychiatric hospital where he worked. They had just begun to take passes every week as part of an effort toward social remediation; it had been Ms. Allen’s first bus ride without a staff member.\n\nAccording to the psychiatrist, Ms. Allen had received a diagnosis of “childhood-onset, treatment-resistant paranoid schizophrenia.” She had started hearing voices by age 5 years. Big, strong, intrusive, and psychotic, she had been hospitalized almost constantly since age 11. Her auditory hallucinations generally consisted of a critical voice commenting on her behavior. Her thinking was concrete, but when relaxed she could be self-reflective. She was motivated to please and recurrently said her biggest goal was to “have my own room in my own house with my own friends.” The psychiatrist said that he was not sure what had caused her to pull out the knife. She had not been hallucinating lately and had been feeling less paranoid, but he wondered if she had been more psychotic than she had let on. It was possible that she was just impatient and irritated. The psychiatrist also believed that she had spent almost no period of life developing normally and so had very little experience with the real world.\n\nMs. Allen had been taking clozapine for 1 year, with good resolution of her auditory hallucinations. She had gained 35 pounds on the clozapine, but she had less trouble getting out of bed in the morning and was functioning at a higher level. She was hoping to get a job and live more independently, and the bus trip had been intended as a step in that direction. Because of these improvements and goals, she had insisted on continuing to take the clozapine despite the weight gain.",

        "vignette": "Gregory Baker was a 20-year-old African American man who was brought to the emergency room (ER) by the campus police of the university from which he had been suspended several months earlier. The police had been called by a professor who reported that Mr. Baker had walked into his classroom shouting, “I am the Joker, and I am looking for Batman.” When Mr. Baker refused to leave the class, the professor contacted security.\n\nAlthough Mr. Baker had much academic success as a teenager, his behavior had become increasingly odd during the past year. He quit seeing his friends and spent most of his time lying in bed staring at the ceiling. He lived with several family members but rarely spoke to any of them. He had been suspended from college because of lack of attendance. His sister said that she had recurrently seen him mumbling quietly to himself and noted that he would sometimes, at night, stand on the roof of their home and wave his arms as if he were “conducting a symphony.” He denied having any intention of jumping from the roof or having any thoughts of self-harm, but claimed that he felt liberated and in tune with the music when he was on the roof. Although his father and sister had tried to encourage him to see someone at the university’s student health clinic, Mr. Baker had never seen a psychiatrist and had no prior hospitalizations.\n\nDuring the prior several months, Mr. Baker had become increasingly preoccupied with a female friend, Anne, who lived down the street. While he insisted to his family that they were engaged, Anne told Mr. Baker’s sister that they had hardly ever spoken and certainly were not dating. Mr. Baker’s sister also reported that he had written many letters to Anne but never mailed them; instead, they just accumulated on his desk.\n\nHis family said that they had never known him to use illicit substances or alcohol, and his toxicology screen was negative. When asked about drug use, Mr. Baker appeared angry and did not answer.\n\nOn examination in the ER, Mr. Baker was a well-groomed young man who was generally uncooperative. He appeared constricted, guarded, inattentive, and preoccupied. He became enraged when the ER staff brought him dinner. He loudly insisted that all of the hospital’s food was poisoned and that he would only drink a specific type of bottled water. He was noted to have paranoid, grandiose, and romantic delusions. He appeared to be internally preoccupied, although he denied hallucinations. Mr. Baker reported feeling “bad” but denied depression and did not show disturbances in his sleep or appetite. He was adequately oriented to person and place but less so to time. He spoke articulately but refused formal cognitive testing. His insight and judgment were deemed to be poor.\n\nMr. Baker’s grandmother had died in a state psychiatric hospital, where she had lived for 30 years. Her diagnosis was unknown. Mr. Baker’s mother was reportedly “crazy.” She had abandoned the family when Mr. Baker was young, and he was raised by his father and paternal grandmother.\n\nUltimately, Mr. Baker agreed to sign himself into the psychiatric unit, stating, “I don’t mind staying here. Anne will probably be there, so I can spend my time with her.”",

        "vignette": "Hakim Coleman was a 25-year-old U.S. Army veteran turned community college student who presented to the emergency room (ER) with his girlfriend and sister. On examination, he was a tall, slim, and well-groomed young man with glasses. He spoke softly, with an increased latency of speech. His affect was blunted except when he became anxious while discussing his symptoms.\n\nMr. Coleman stated that he had come to the ER at his sister’s suggestion. He said he could use a “general checkup” because of several days of “migraines” and “hallucinations of a spiritual nature” that had persisted for 3 months. His headache involved “sharp, shooting” sensations in various bilateral locations in his head and a “ringing” sensation along the midline of his brain that seemed to worsen when he thought about his vices.\n\nMr. Coleman described his vices as being “alcohol, cigarettes, disrespecting my parents, girls.” He denied guilt, anxiety, or preoccupation with any of his military duties during his tour in Iraq, although his sister shared that Hakim’s military responsibilities were of a confidential nature. He had joined an evangelical church 4 months earlier in the context of being “riddled with guilt” about “all the things I’ve done.” Three months earlier, he began “hearing voices trying to make me feel guilty” most days. The last auditory hallucination had been the day before. During these past few months, he became withdrawn and noticed that strangers were commenting on his past sins.\n\nMr. Coleman believed that his migraines and guilt might be due to alcohol withdrawal. He had been drinking three or four cans of beer most days of the week for several years until he “quit” 4 months earlier after joining the church. He still drank “a beer or two” every other week but felt guilty afterward. He denied alcohol withdrawal symptoms such as tremor and sweats. He had smoked cannabis up to twice monthly for years but completely quit when he joined the church. He denied using other illicit drugs except for one uneventful use of cocaine 3 years earlier. He sometimes would sleep only a few hours and did report some nightmares. Otherwise, Mr. Coleman denied depressive, manic, or psychotic symptoms and violent ideation.\n\nRegarding PTSD, Mr. Coleman’s score on the 20-item self-administered PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 was below the cutoff score (between 31 and 33 out of 80) that would indicate probable PTSD in veterans. He denied that his military experience was unusually or especially frightening, horrible, or traumatic. Regarding other stressors, he felt overwhelmed by his current responsibilities, which included attending school and near-daily church activities. He had been a straight-A student at the start of the school year but was now receiving Bs and Cs.\n\nThe patient’s girlfriend and sister were interviewed separately. They agreed that Mr. Coleman had become socially isolative and quiet, after having previously been fun and outgoing. He had also never been especially religious prior to this episode. His sister believed that Mr. Coleman had been “brainwashed” by the church. His girlfriend, however, had attended services with Mr. Coleman. She reported that several members of the congregation had told her they had occasionally talked to new members who felt guilt over their prior behaviors, but none who had ever hallucinated, and they were worried about him.\n\nA physical examination of the patient, including a neurological screen, was unremarkable, as were routine laboratory testing, a blood alcohol level, and urine toxicology. A noncontrast head computed tomography (CT) scan was normal.",

        "vignette": "John Evans was a 25-year-old single, unemployed white man who had been seeing a psychiatrist for several years for management of psychosis, depression, anxiety, and abuse of marijuana and alcohol.\n\nAfter an apparently normal childhood, Mr. Evans began to show dysphoric mood, anhedonia, low energy, and social isolation by age 15 years. At about the same time, Mr. Evans began to drink alcohol and smoke marijuana every day. In addition, he developed recurrent panic attacks, marked by a sudden onset of palpitations, diaphoresis, and thoughts that he was going to die. When he was at his most depressed and panicky, he twice received a combination of sertraline 100 mg/day and psychotherapy. In both cases, his most intense depressive symptoms lifted within a few weeks, and he discontinued the sertraline after a few months. Between episodes of severe depression, he was generally seen as sad, irritable, and amotivated. His school performance declined around tenth grade and remained marginal throughout the rest of high school. He did not attend college as his parents had expected him to, but instead lived at home and did odd jobs in the neighborhood.\n\nAround age 20, Mr. Evans developed a psychotic episode in which he had the conviction that he had murdered people when he was 6 years old. Although he could not remember who these people were or the circumstances, he was absolutely convinced that this had happened, something that was confirmed by continuous voices accusing him of being a murderer. He also became convinced that other people would punish him for what had happened, and thus he feared for his life. Over the ensuing few weeks, he became guilt-ridden and preoccupied with the idea that he should kill himself by slashing his wrists, which culminated in his being psychiatrically hospitalized.\n\nAlthough he was predominantly anxious on admission, Mr. Evans soon became very depressed, with prominent anhedonia, poor sleep, and decreased appetite and concentration. With the combined use of antipsychotic and antidepressant medications, both the depression and the psychotic symptoms remitted after 4 weeks. Therefore, the total duration of the psychotic episode was approximately 7 weeks, 4 of which were also characterized by major depressive disorder. Mr. Evans had been hospitalized with the same pattern of symptoms two additional times before age 22, and each of these episodes started with several weeks of delusions and hallucinations related to his conviction that he had murdered someone when he was a child, followed by severe depression lasting an additional month. Both relapses occurred while he was apparently adherent to reasonable dosages of antipsychotic and antidepressant medications. During the 3 years prior to this evaluation, Mr. Evans had been adherent to clozapine and had been without hallucinations and delusions. He had also been adherent to his antidepressant medication and supportive psychotherapy, although his dysphoria, irritability, and amotivation never completely resolved.\n\nMr. Evans’s history was significant for marijuana and alcohol misuse that began at age 15. Before the onset of psychosis at age 20, he smoked several joints of marijuana almost daily and binge-drank on weekends, with occasional blackouts. After the onset of the psychosis, he decreased his marijuana and alcohol use significantly, with two several-month-long periods of abstinence, yet he continued to have psychotic episodes up through age 22. He started attending Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous groups, achieved sobriety from marijuana and alcohol at age 23, and had remained sober for the 2 years prior to this evaluation.",

To commemorate the event, they decided to get tattoos. Afterward, they went to a nearby park, where Mr. Foster bought and smoked a marijuana cigarette. During the ensuing hour, Mr. Foster began to believe that the symbols in his tattoo had mysterious meaning and power. He became convinced that the tattoo artist was conspiring with others against him and that his wife was cheating on him. After returning to the hotel, the patient searched his wife’s phone for evidence of her infidelity and threatened to jump out the window. The patient’s wife, an ER physician, successfully convinced the patient to go to sleep, thinking that the episode would resolve.\n\nThe following day, the patient remained paranoid and delusional. He again threatened to jump out the window, and indicated that he would have no choice but to kill his wife the next time she slept. She called 911, and her husband was brought to the ER of a large nearby hospital. Later that day, he was admitted to an acute inpatient psychiatric unit with a diagnosis of unspecified psychotic disorder.\n\nMr. Foster had smoked cannabis sporadically from age 18 but began to smoke daily 5 years prior to this admission. In the past year, his cannabis use had steadily increased; previously he had been smoking once per day, but more recently his use had increased to three times a day, beginning when he awoke. He noted that he has begun to feel “anxious” when not under the influence of cannabis and believed his thrice-daily use helped him “even out.” The patient and his wife denied that he had ever used other illicit substances, and the patient indicated that he rarely drank alcohol. Until 1 year earlier, he had never seen a psychiatrist or been viewed by his friends and family as having significant psychiatric issues.\n\nIn the past year, however, Mr. Foster had been hospitalized four times for psychiatric problems. He had been hospitalized twice with classic manic symptoms and once for a suicidal depression. In addition, 7 months prior to this presentation, the patient had been hospitalized for a 6-week episode of cannabis-induced psychosis, which responded well to risperidone. At that time, his main symptom was paranoia. Two months prior to this admission, he entered a 1-month inpatient substance abuse treatment program for cannabis use disorder. Until the weekend of this admission, he had continued to smoke marijuana but had not used alcohol or any other substances since discharge from the rehabilitation facility. He had also been functioning well while taking lithium monotherapy for 3 months.\n\nMr. Foster had been steadily employed as a film editor since graduating from college. His father had a bipolar disorder, and his paternal grandfather committed suicide via gunshot but with an unknown diagnosis.\n\nOn the second day of hospitalization, Mr. Foster began to realize that his wife was not cheating on him and that the symbols in his tattoo were not meaningful. By the third day, he spontaneously said the paranoia was the result of cannabis intoxication. He declined further risperidone but continued lithium monotherapy. He was discharged with an appointment to follow up with his outpatient psychiatrist.",

        "vignette": "Lara Gonzalez, a 51-year-old divorced freelance journalist, brought herself to the emergency room requesting dermatological evaluation for flea infestation. When no corroborating evidence was found on skin examination and the patient insisted that she was unsafe at home, she was admitted to an inpatient psychiatric service with “unspecified psychotic disorder.”\n\nHer concerns began around 1 week prior to presentation. To contend with financial stress, she had taken in temporary renters for a spare room in her home and had begun pet sitting for some neighbors. Under these conditions, she perceived tiny insects burrowing into her skin and walls and covering her rugs and mattress. She had spent the 36 hours prior to presentation frantically cleaning her home, fearing that her tenants would not pay if they saw the fleas. She showered repeatedly, using shampoos meant to treat animal infestations, and she consulted three different exterminators, although none found evidence of fleas. She threw away a bag of clothing, believing she heard fleas “rustling and scratching inside.” She bought replacement clothes that she kept in their own trash bag, thereby spending almost all of her savings, which worsened her preexisting financial strain.\n\nAside from her concerns about infestation, Ms. Gonzalez denied symptoms of depression, mania, and suspiciousness. She denied using any drugs or alcohol. No one in her family had a history of psychiatric illness. Ms. Gonzalez had been diagnosed with depression in college and briefly treated with an antidepressant. She had no relevant medical problems.\n\nHer worries about infestation began in the setting of her sister’s diagnosis with invasive cancer, the onset of her own menopause, financial strain that was likely forcing her to move from the United States back to Argentina (her country of origin), and a recent breakup with her boyfriend. At baseline, she described herself as an obsessive person who had always had “contamination phobias” that historically worsened during times of anxiety.\n\nOn mental status examination, Ms. Gonzalez was calm and easily engaged, with normal relatedness and eye contact. She offered up a small plastic bag containing “fleas and larvae” that she had collected in the hospital while awaiting evaluation. Inspection of the bag revealed lint and plaster. Her speech had an urgent quality to it, and she described her mood as “sad right now.” She was tearful intermittently but otherwise smiling reactively. Her thoughts were overly inclusive and intensely focused on fleas. She expressed belief that each time a hair fell out of her head, it would morph into larvae. When crying, she believed an egg came out of her tear duct. She was not suicidal or homicidal. She expressed an unshakable belief that lint was larvae, and that she was infested. She denied hallucinations. Cognition was intact. Her insight was impaired, but her judgment was deemed reasonably appropriate.\n\nDermatological examination revealed no insects or larvae embedded in Ms. Gonzalez’s skin. Results of neurological examination, head computed tomography scan, laboratory tests, and toxicology data were normal. She was discharged from the emergency room on a low-dose antipsychotic medication and seen weekly for supportive psychotherapy. Her preoccupation improved within days and resolved entirely within 2 weeks. She developed enough insight to refer to her belief that fleas were in her skin as a “crazy thought.” She attributed her “break from reality” to multiple stressors, and was able to articulate that she relied on her delusion as a way to distract herself from real problems. Her family corroborated her quick return to baseline.",

The referral form indicated that the man was “schizophrenic” and an “emotionally disturbed person.” One of the police officers said that the man offered to pay them for sex while in the back seat of their patrol car. He referred to himself as the “New Jesus” and declined to offer another name. He refused to sit and instead ran through the ER. He was put into restraints and received intramuscularly administered lorazepam 2 mg and haloperidol 5 mg. Intravenous diphenhydramine (Benadryl) 50 mg was readied in case of extrapyramidal side effects. The admitting team wrote that he had “unspecified psychosis” and transferred him to the psychiatry team that worked in the ER.\n\nDespite being restrained, the patient remained giddily agitated, talking about receiving messages from God. When asked when he had last slept, he said he no longer needed sleep, indicating that he had “been touched by Heaven.” His speech was rapid, disorganized, and difficult to understand. A complete blood count, blood chemistries, and a toxicology screen were drawn. After an additional 45 minutes of agitation, he received another dose of lorazepam. This calmed him, but he still did not sleep. The restraints were removed.\n\nAn hour after receiving the initial haloperidol and lorazepam, the patient was interviewed while he sat in a chair in the ER. He was an overweight African American man who was disheveled and malodorous. He did not smell of alcohol. He made poor eye contact, instead looking at nearby people, a ticking clock, the examiner, a nearby nurse—at anything or anyone that moved. His speech was disorganized, rapid, and hard to follow. His leg bounced rapidly up and down, but he did not get out of his chair or threaten the interviewer. He described his mood as “not bad.” His affect was labile. He often laughed for no particular reason but would get angrily frustrated when he felt misunderstood. His thought process was disorganized. He had grandiose delusions, and his perceptions were significant for “God talking to me.” He denied other hallucinations and denied suicidal and homicidal ideation. When asked the date, he responded with an extended discussion about the underlying meaning of the day’s date, which he missed by a single day. He remembered the names of the two police officers who had brought him to the hospital. He refused more cognitive testing. His insight and judgment appeared poor.\n\nThe patient’s sister arrived an hour later, after having been called by a neighbor who had seen her brother, Mark Hill, being taken away in a police car. The sister said that her brother had seemed strange a week earlier, uncharacteristically arguing with relatives at a holiday gathering. He had claimed not to need sleep at that time and had been talking about his “gifts.” She had tried to contact Mr. Hill since then, but he had not responded to phone, e-mail, or text messages. She said he did not like to talk about his issues, but she had twice seen a bottle of olanzapine in his house. She knew their father had been called “schizophrenic” and “bipolar,” but she had not seen her father since she was a child. She said that Mr. Hill did not typically use drugs. She also said he was 34 years old and a middle school math teacher who had just finished a semester of teaching.\n\nA review of Mr. Hill’s electronic medical record indicated that he had experienced a similar episode 2 years earlier. At that time, a toxicology screen had been negative. He had been hospitalized for 2 weeks on the inpatient psychiatric service and was given a discharge diagnosis of “schizoaffective disorder”; he also was prescribed olanzapine and referred to an outpatient clinic for follow-up. The chart had additionally referred to two previous admissions to the county inpatient hospital, but records from that hospital were not available after hours.\n\nOver the next 24 hours, Mr. Hill calmed significantly. He continued to believe that he was being misunderstood and that he did not need to be hospitalized. When asked, he agreed that he had a direct connection to God and “an important role on Earth,” but he denied having a connection to anyone called the “New Jesus.” His speech remained rapid and loud. The interviewer noted that he seemed easier to redirect, though his thoughts continued to jump from idea to idea. He remained tense and jumpy but denied paranoia or fear.\n\nSerial physical examinations revealed no abnormalities aside from blisters on his feet. The patient was not tremulous, and his deep tendon reflexes were symmetrical and graded 2 of 4. He showed no neurological asymmetry. His toxicology screen was negative and his blood alcohol level was zero. His initial lab results were pertinent for elevated blood urea nitrogen and a blood sugar level of 210 mg/dL. His mean corpuscular volume, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ratio, and magnesium levels were normal. His BMI was 30.8.",

He noted that these “dark periods” had gone on as long as he had known her but that she had experienced at least a half dozen of these episodes in the prior year. He said they typically improved within a few weeks of restarting her fluoxetine. He added that he wondered whether alcohol and clonazepam worsened her symptoms, because she routinely ramped up their use when the dark periods began.\n\nMs. Ingram’s husband said he had decided to bring her to the ER after he discovered that she had recently created a blog entitled Nancy Ingram’s Best Stock Picks. Such an activity not only was out of character but also, given her job as a stock analyst for a large investment bank, was strictly against company policy. He said that she had been working on these stock picks around the clock, forgoing her own meals as well as her responsibilities at work and with her children. She countered that she was fine and that her blog would “make them as rich as Croesus.”\n\nThe patient had first been diagnosed with depression in college, after the death of her father from suicide. He had been a wildly erratic, alcohol-abusing businessman whom the patient loved very much. Her paternal grandmother had several “nervous breakdowns,” but her diagnosis and treatment history were unknown. Since college, her mood had generally been “down,” interspersed with recurrent bouts of worsened dysphoria, insomnia, and uncharacteristically rapid speech and hyperalertness. She had tried psychotherapy sporadically and taken a series of antidepressant medications, but her husband noted that the baseline depression persisted and that the dark periods were increasing in frequency.\n\nHer outpatient psychiatrist noted that Ms. Ingram appeared to have dysthymia (persistent depressive disorder) and recurrent major depressive disorder. He also said that he had never seen her during her periods of edginess and insomnia—she always refused to see him until the “really down” periods improved—and that she had refused him access to her husband or to any other source of collateral information.\n\nOn examination, the patient was pacing angrily in the exam room. She was dressed in jeans and a shirt that was carelessly unbuttoned. Her eyes appeared glazed and unfocused. She responded to the examiner’s entrance by sitting down and explaining that this was all a miscommunication, that she was fine and needed to get home immediately to tend to her business. Her speech was rapid, pressured, and very difficult to interrupt. She admitted to not sleeping but denied that it was a problem. She denied hallucinations but admitted, with a smile, to a unique ability to predict the stock market. She refused cognitive testing, saying she would decline the opportunity to be “a trained seal, a guinea pig, Mr. Ed, and a barking dog, thank you very much, and may I leave now?” Her insight into her situation appeared poor, and her judgment was deemed to be impaired.",

        "vignette": "Olivia Jacobs, a 22-year-old graduate student in architecture, was referred for an urgent psychiatric consultation after she told her roommate that she was suicidal. Ms. Jacobs had a history of mood symptoms that had been under good control with lithium and sertraline, but her depressive symptoms had returned soon after she had arrived in a new city for school, 3 months earlier. She had become preoccupied with ways in which she might kill herself without inconveniencing others. Her dominant suicidal thoughts involved shooting herself in the head while leaning out the window, so as not to cause a mess in the dorm. Although she did not have access to a gun, she spent time searching the Web for places where she might purchase one.\n\nMs. Jacobs’s psychiatric history began at age 15, when she began to regularly drink alcohol and smoke marijuana, usually when out at dance clubs with friends. Both of these substances calmed her, and she denied that either had become problematic. She had used neither alcohol nor marijuana since starting graduate school.\n\nAround age 17, she began experiencing brief, intense depressive episodes, marked by tearfulness, feelings of guilt, anhedonia, hopelessness, low energy, and poor concentration. She would sleep more than 12 hours a day and neglect responsibilities at school and home.\n\nThese depressive episodes would generally shift after a few weeks into periods of increased energy, pressured speech, and unusual creativity. She would stay up most of the night working on projects and building architectural models. These revved-up episodes lasted about 5 days and were punctuated by feelings that her friends had turned against her and that they were not really friends at all. Worried especially about the paranoia, her family had brought her to a psychiatrist, who diagnosed her as having bipolar II disorder and prescribed lithium and sertraline. Although Ms. Jacobs’s moods did not completely stabilize on this regimen, she did well enough at a local university to be accepted into a prestigious graduate program far from home. At that point the depression returned, and she became intensely suicidal for the first time.\n\nUpon evaluation, the patient was visibly depressed and tearful, and had psychomotor slowing. She said it was very difficult to get out of bed and she was not attending class most days. She reported hopelessness, poor concentration, and guilt about spending family money for school when she was not able to perform. She stated that she thought about suicide most of the time and that she had found nothing to distract her. She denied recent drinking or smoking marijuana, stating she did not feel like “partying.” She acknowledged profound feelings of emptiness and indicated that she had occasionally cut her arms superficially to “see what it would feel like.” She stated that she knew that cutting herself in this way would not kill her. She reported depersonalization and occasional panic attacks. She denied having mood instability, derealization, problems with impulsivity, concerns about her identity, and fears of abandonment.",

        "vignette": "Pamela Kershaw was a 43-year-old married librarian who presented to an outpatient mental health clinic with a long history of episodic depressions. Most recently, she described depressed mood during the month since she began a new job. She said she was preoccupied with concerns that her new boss and colleagues thought her work was inadequate and slow and that she was unfriendly. She had no energy and enthusiasm at home, either, and instead of playing with her children or talking to her husband, she tended to watch television for hours, overeat, and sleep excessively. This had led to a 6-pound weight gain in just 3 weeks, which made her feel even worse about herself. She had begun to cry several times a week, which she reported as the sign that she “knew the depression had returned.” She had also begun to think often of death, although she had never attempted suicide.\n\nMs. Kershaw said her memory about her history of depressions was a little fuzzy, so she brought in her husband, who had known her since college. They agreed that she had first become depressed in her teens and that she had experienced at least five discrete periods of depression as an adult. These episodes generally included depressed mood, anergia, amotivation, hypersomnia, hyperphagia, deep feelings of guilt, decreased libido, and mild to moderate suicidal ideation without plan. Her depressions were often punctuated by periods of “too much” energy, irritability, pressured speech, and flight of ideas. These episodes of excess energy could last hours, days, or a couple of weeks. The depressed mood would not lift during these periods, but she would “at least be able to do a few things.”\n\nWhen specifically asked, Ms. Kershaw’s husband described distinctive times when Ms. Kershaw seemed unusually excited, happy, and self-confident, and like a “different person.” She would talk fast, seem energized and optimistic, do the daily chores very efficiently, and start (and often finish) new projects. She would need little sleep and still be enthusiastic the next day. Ms. Kershaw recalled these periods but said they felt “normal.” In response to a question about hypersexuality, Ms. Kershaw smiled for the only time during the interview, saying that although her husband seemed to be including her good periods as part of her illness, he had not been complaining when she had her longest such episode (about 6 days) when they first started dating in college. Since then, she reported that these episodes were “fairly frequent” and lasted 2 or 3 days.\n\nBecause of her periodic low mood and thoughts of death, she had seen various psychiatrists since her mid-teenage years. Psychotherapy tended to work “okay” until she had another depressive episode, when she would be unable to attend sessions and would then just quit. Three antidepressant trials of adequate dosage and duration (6 months to 3 years) were each associated with short-term relief of depression, followed by relapse. Both alone and in the presence of her husband, Ms. Kershaw denied any history of alcohol or substance misuse. A maternal aunt and maternal grandfather had been recurrently hospitalized for mania, although Ms. Kershaw was quick to point out that she was “not at all like them.”\n\nOn examination, Ms. Kershaw was a well-groomed, overweight woman who often averted her eyes and tended to speak very softly. No abnormal motor movements were noted, but her movements were constrained, and she did not use hand gestures. Her mood was depressed. Her affect was sad and constricted. Her thought processes were fluid, though possibly slowed. Her thought content was notable for depressive content, including passive suicidal ideation without evidence of paranoia, hallucinations, or delusions. Her insight and judgment were intact.",

        "vignette": "Rachel, a 15-year-old girl, was referred for a psychiatric evaluation because of worsening difficulties at home and at school over the prior year. The mother’s chief concern was that “Rachel’s meds aren’t working.” Rachel said she had no particular complaints.\n\nIn meetings with the patient and her mother, both together and separately, both reported that Rachel’s grades had dropped from As and Bs to Cs and Ds, that she had lost many of her long-standing friends, and that conflicts at home had escalated to the point that her mother characterized her as “nasty and mean.”\n\nRachel first saw a psychiatrist at age 7 years when she was evaluated for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) because of long-standing restlessness, impulsivity, and distractibility. After behavioral interventions were ineffective, the patient began treatment with a methylphenidate-based medication at age 8. Improvement was seen at school, in her social life, and at home. For the ensuing 6 years, Rachel had done well and was “pretty much like other kids as long as she took her medicine.”\n\nAt around age 14, however, Rachel became “moody.” Instead of being a “bubbly teenager,” she would spend days by herself and hardly speak to anyone. During these periods of persistent sadness, she would sleep more than usual, complain that her friends didn’t like her anymore, and not seem interested in anything. At other times, she would be a “holy terror” at home, frequently yelling at her sister and parents to the point that everyone was “walking on eggshells.” At about that time, Rachel’s grades plummeted, and her pediatrician increased the dosage of her ADHD medication.\n\nRachel’s family history was pertinent for a father who “had real problems.” Although her mother did not know his diagnosis, he had been treated with lithium. The father had left the family before Rachel was born, and the two had never met.\n\nIn exploring the periods of irritability, dysphoria, and social isolation, the clinician asked whether there had been times in which Rachel was in an especially good mood. The mother recalled multiple periods in which her daughter would be “giddy” for a week or two. She would “laugh at anything” and would enthusiastically help out with and even initiate household chores. Because these were the “good phases,” the mother did not think these episodes were noteworthy.\n\nRachel had no general medical problems. She denied use of alcohol, illicit substances, and medications other than the prescribed ADHD medication.\n\nOn examination while alone, Rachel was a casually groomed teenager who was coherent and goal directed. She appeared wary and sad, with some affective constriction. She did not like how she had been feeling, saying she felt depressed for a week, then okay, then “hilarious” for a few days, then “murderous,” like someone was “churning up my insides.” She did not know why she felt like that, and she hated not knowing how she would be feeling the next day. She denied psychotic symptoms, confusion, and suicidal and homicidal thoughts. She was cognitively intact.",

As the patient entered the clinic waiting room, he announced, “God has cured me! I can stop my antivirals!”\n\nWhile Mr. Lopez fidgeted on a chair, furiously writing on a yellow pad, his partner provided the recent history. He said that the patient had been doing well until approximately 1 month earlier. At that point, he began an unusually intense editing project. After about 10 days of little sleep, “boundless energy,” and activity, Mr. Lopez seemed edgy, a little pressured, and “glassy-eyed.” That night, the two of them went to a party to celebrate the completion of the work project. Despite several years of Narcotics Anonymous meetings and abstinence from illicit substances, Mr. Lopez took crystal methamphetamine, a stimulant. Acutely anxious and paranoid that they were being followed, Mr. Lopez drank three martinis but still did not sleep that night. Over the ensuing days the patient became less paranoid, but he appeared increasingly distracted and his speech was more pressured.\n\nMr. Lopez’s work project was returned with multiple negative comments and requests for corrections. Instead of focusing on his editing, however, he stayed up late every night, intent on finding a cure for HIV. He made inappropriate, hypersexual advances toward other men at the gym, where he spent much of the day. He lost at least 5 pounds after deciding he should take vitamin supplements instead of food and his antiretroviral medication. He refused to go to the emergency room but finally agreed to come to his routine AIDS clinic appointment to show his doctors how well he had done despite not having taken his medications in over a month.\n\nMr. Lopez’s psychiatric history was without a prior episode of clear-cut mania, but he had been depressed as a teenager during the early phase of his coming-out process. That episode was punctuated by a purposeful overdose and a 2-week psychiatric hospitalization and treatment with antidepressant medication and psychotherapy. Mr. Lopez had discontinued the medication because it made him “hyper and edgy,” and he stopped the psychotherapy because “it was pointless.” He used methamphetamine frequently for several years, which led to recurrent unprotected intercourse with strangers.\n\nMr. Lopez was diagnosed with HIV at age 22, at which point he went to an outpatient substance use disorder rehabilitation center and discontinued his use of stimulants and alcohol. His lowest CD4 lymphocyte count had been 216 cells/mm3, when he was age 24, at which time his viral load was 1.6 million copies. He had been reportedly adherent to his antiretroviral medications since then. His most recent CD4 count, 6 months prior to this episode, had been 526 cells/mm3. His viral load had been undetectable. He had suffered fatigue but had not had any AIDS-defining illnesses. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain revealed mild cortical atrophy and periventricular white matter disease in excess of what would be expected for his age. The partner was unsure when Mr. Lopez had discontinued his antiretrovirals but thought it might have been months earlier. He also wondered if Mr. Lopez had “lost a step” cognitively over the past year.\n\nHis family psychiatric history was significant for a maternal aunt who had received lithium and several courses of electroconvulsive therapy, but her diagnosis was unknown.\n\nOn examination, the patient was a sloppily dressed young man who told a pressured, disjointed story of events over the prior month. He was difficult to direct and was uncharacteristically irritable and devaluing. He was preoccupied with having discovered a cure for HIV through multivitamins and exercise. He denied hallucinations and suicidal and homicidal ideation. He refused cognitive testing, and his insight and judgment appeared poor.",

Her husband stated that she had been behaving very strangely and that she had become convinced that she had smothered and killed her baby.\n\nHer husband reported that after a normal pregnancy and uncomplicated delivery, Ms. Norman had happily gone home with their first child. On the third day after delivery, however, her mood and affect began to shift rapidly between elation and weepiness. She became irritable and anxious. She slept only an hour a night, even when her baby was asleep. Her behavior became increasingly bizarre, with overactivity and agitation. Her speech was rapid and digressive. Although not previously a religious person, she became convinced that God was speaking through her and that she had special powers that could solve the problems of the world. She told her husband that she could identify evil people by looking into their eyes and had begun to worry that she was surrounded by evil people, including her own mother. Most disturbing for her, whenever she was out of sight of her son, she became totally convinced that she had smothered him, and no one could convince her otherwise.\n\nMs. Norman had a history of three episodes of major depressive disorder in her teens and early 20s. These episodes resolved with psychotherapy and antidepressant medication. She also had a psychiatric admission for mania 3 years prior to the delivery of her child, after a flight from Asia to Europe. Following treatment with antipsychotic medication, she became depressed for several months. Although a diagnosis of bipolar disorder was discussed at this time, she was reluctant to accept this label, attributing the episode to stress and jet lag. She had discontinued the psychiatric medication in anticipation of getting pregnant.\n\nMs. Norman’s own mother had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital shortly after the birth of her first child. This episode was not talked about in the family, and there were few other details. She had no other family history of note.\n\nUntil just before delivery of her child, Ms. Norman had been a highly functional nurse in a renal unit. Her husband was the head of a sales team, and they lived in comfortable social circumstances. She had no history of illicit drug use and, prior to pregnancy, drank only 2 or 3 units of alcohol a week.\n\nOn mental status examination, Ms. Norman wandered around the room, seemingly unable to sit for more than a few moments. She was distractible and overtalkative, and demonstrated flight of ideas, flitting from one subject to another. Her mood was labile. At times she appeared happily euphoric. At other times she was tearful, and she could become quickly irritable when she felt she was not being understood. It was clear that she had a number of delusional beliefs but was unwilling to discuss most of them with the examiner. She did insist that she had already killed her own child, which led to several minutes of tears, but she returned to an edgy euphoria within a few minutes. She denied intent to harm herself or anyone else. She appeared inattentive, with poor concentration, but would not participate in formal cognitive testing.\n\nPhysical examination and laboratory testing results were all within normal limits.",

Ms. Owens arrived at the appointment well dressed and a little agitated. Speaking at a normal pace, she explained that her depressive symptoms had begun 2 years earlier in the setting of initiating divorce proceedings from her fourth husband. She described poor mood, incapacitating worry about her future, and poor concentration. These symptoms progressed to anhedonia, decreased energy, hypersomnia with interrupted sleep, passive suicidal ideation, and increased appetite with carbohydrate craving. She stopped going to work as an event planner and began spending most of the day in bed.\n\nMs. Owens initially sought treatment from a homeopath, who prescribed a variety of remedies that were not helpful. She eventually saw her internist, who prescribed alprazolam 0.25 mg three times a day as needed. This medication reduced her worry but had little effect on her mood. Her internist then initiated sertraline 50 mg/day, increasing the dosage (as tolerated) to 200 mg/day. Over the ensuing 2 months, Ms. Owens’s sleep improved and she no longer experienced suicidal thoughts. However, she became more anxious, irritable, agitated, and energized and noted that her thoughts moved rapidly. She denied impulsivity and psychotic symptoms.\n\nMs. Owens had a long-standing history of similar depressive episodes. The first such episode occurred during college, lasted for several months, and was untreated.\n\nWhen specifically asked, she described multiple periods in her life when she had moderately elevated mood, rapid thoughts, and increased energy. It seemed that many important life accomplishments occurred during these periods. For instance, as a young, recently divorced unemployed single mother, she agreed to throw a bridal shower for her best friend. She pored over bridal and craft magazines, determined to create a fabulous party on a shoestring budget. She became totally engrossed in the project, seeming to have abundant energy and ideas. The shower was a huge success and launched Ms. Owens’s career as a party planner. She hid her mood swings from her clients and colleagues, leveraging her elevated mood states to project a high-energy “face,” but then would retreat and avoid work when her mood became low. She also became more irritable during these high-energy episodes, and she believed that each of her marriages both began and ended because of her tendency to “get emotional” when she was in these elevated mood states. Although these periods could last for many weeks, she did not experience changes in sleep, engage in risky behaviors, speak quickly, or become grandiose, and she saw nothing problematic about them.\n\nMs. Owens also reported that she drank heavily when she was in her 40s but rarely did so now. She denied prior suicide attempts and psychiatric hospitalizations. Her mother had been treated for depression with sertraline, and her brother was treated with lithium for bipolar disorder.",

Most recently, Wyatt had smashed a closet door to gain access to a video game that had been withheld to encourage him to do homework. At school, Wyatt was noted to have a hair-trigger temper, and he had recently been suspended for punching another boy in the face after losing a chess match.\n\nWyatt had been an extremely active young boy, running “all the time.” He was also a “sensitive kid” who constantly worried that things might go wrong. His tolerance for frustration had been less than that of his peers, and his parents quit taking him shopping because he would predictably become distraught whenever they did not buy him whatever toys he wanted.\n\nGrade school reports indicated fidgetiness, wandering attention, and impulsivity. When Wyatt was 10 years old, a child psychiatrist diagnosed him as having attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), combined type. Wyatt was referred to a behavioral therapist and started taking methylphenidate, which led to an improvement in his symptoms. However, by fourth grade, his moodiness became more pronounced and persistent. He was generally surly, complaining that life was “unfair.” Wyatt and his parents began their daily limit-setting battles at breakfast while he delayed getting ready for school, and then—by evening—continued their arguments about homework, video games, and bedtime. These arguments often included Wyatt screaming and throwing nearby objects. By the time he reached sixth grade, his parents were tired and his siblings avoided him.\n\nAccording to Wyatt’s parents, he had no problems with appetite, and although they fought about when he would go to bed, he did not appear to have a sleep disturbance. He appeared to find pleasure in his usual activities, maintained good energy, and had no history of elation, grandiosity, or decreased need for sleep lasting more than a day. Although they described him as “moody, isolated, and lonely,” his parents did not see him as depressed. They denied any history of hallucinations, abuse, trauma, suicidality, homicidality, a wish to self-harm, or any premeditated wish to harm others. He and his parents denied he had ever used alcohol or drugs. His medical history was unremarkable. His family history was notable for anxiety and depression in the father, alcoholism in the paternal grandparents, and possible untreated ADHD in the mother.\n\nOn interview, Wyatt was mildly anxious yet easy to engage. His body twisted back and forth as he sat in the chair. In reviewing his temper outbursts and physical aggression, Wyatt said, “It’s like I can’t help myself. I don’t mean to do these things. But when I get mad, I don’t think about any of that. It’s like my mind goes blank.” When asked how he felt about his outbursts, Wyatt looked very sad and said earnestly, “I hate when I’m that way.” If he could change three things in his life, Wyatt replied, “I would have more friends, I would do better in school, and I would stop getting mad so much.”",

She and her husband planned to wait a few years before having another child, and her husband made it clear that he would have preferred that she terminate the pregnancy, an option she would not consider because of her religion. He had also been upset that she was “too tired” to do paid work outside of the home during her pregnancy. She became increasingly dysphoric, hopeless, and overwhelmed after the delivery. Breastfeeding was not going well, and she began to believe her baby was “rejecting me” by refusing her breast, spitting up her milk, and crying. Her baby became very colicky, so she felt forced to hold him most of the day. She wondered whether she deserved this difficulty because she had not wanted the pregnancy.\n\nHer husband was gone much of the time for work, and she found it very difficult to take care of the new baby and her lively and demanding 16-month-old daughter. Over the past several weeks she slept little, felt constantly tired, cried often, and worried about how she was going to get through the day.

She also denied any hallucinations and delusions, although she had considered whether the current situation was punishment for not wanting the child. She was fully oriented and could register three objects but only recalled one after 5 minutes. Her intelligence was average. Her insight and judgment were fair to good.",

The young man, who had struggled with major depressive disorder and substance use disorder, had been found surrounded by several emptied pill bottles and an incoherent suicide note.\n\nMr. Quinn had been very close to his troubled son, and he immediately felt crushed, like his life had lost its meaning. In the ensuing 2 weeks, he had constant images of his son and was “obsessed” with how he might have prevented the substance abuse and suicide. He worried that he had been a bad father and that he had spent too much time on his own career and too little time with his son. He felt constantly sad, withdrew from his usual social life, and was unable to concentrate on his work. Although he had never previously drunk more than a few glasses of wine per week, he increased his alcohol intake to half a bottle of wine each night. At that time, his psychiatrist told him that he was struggling with grief and that such a reaction was normal. They agreed to meet for support and to assess the ongoing clinical situation.\n\nMr. Quinn returned to see his psychiatrist weekly. By the sixth week after the suicide, his symptoms had worsened. Instead of thinking about what he might have done differently, he became preoccupied that he should have been the one to die, not his young son. He continued to have trouble falling asleep, but he also tended to awake at 4:30 a.m. and just stare at the ceiling, feeling overwhelmed with fatigue, sadness, and feelings of worthlessness. These symptoms improved during the day, but he also felt a persistent and uncharacteristic loss of self-confidence, sexual interest, and enthusiasm.

During that time, she reported depression every day for most of the day. Symptoms had been worsening for months. She had lost 9 lb (current weight 105 lb) without dieting because she did not feel like eating. She had trouble falling asleep almost every night and woke at 3:00 a.m. several mornings per week (she normally woke at 6:30 a.m.). She had diminished energy, concentration, and ability to perform her administrative job at a dog food processing plant. She was convinced that she had made a mistake that would lead to the deaths of thousands of dogs. She expected that she would soon be arrested, and would rather kill herself than go to prison.\n\nHer primary care physician had recognized the patient’s depressed mood 1 week earlier and had prescribed sertraline and referred her for a psychiatric evaluation.\n\nMs. Reiss denied a previous psychiatric history. One sister suffered from depression. Ms. Reiss denied any history of hypomania or mania. She typically drank a glass of wine with dinner and had started drinking a second glass before bed in hopes of getting a night’s sleep.

        "vignette": "Crystal Smith, a 33-year-old African American homemaker, came to an outpatient clinic seeking “someone to talk to” about feelings of despair that had intensified over the previous 8–10 months. She was particularly upset about marital conflict and an uncharacteristic irritability with her mother-in-law.\n\nMs. Smith said she had begun to wake before dawn, feeling down and tearful. She had difficulty getting out of bed and completing her usual household activities. At times, she felt guilty for not being her “usual self.” At other times, she became easily irritated with her husband and impatient with her mother-in-law for minor transgressions. She relied on her mother-in-law for assistance with her children, but recently her mother-in-law appeared to be less available. Ms. Smith worries that she has become a burden to her mother-in-law. Her related guilt, in combination with her insomnia and fatigue, have made it very difficult for Ms. Smith to get her children to school on time. In the past few months, she had lost 13 pounds without dieting. She denied current suicidal ideation, saying she “would never do something like that,” but acknowledged having thought that she “should just give up” and that she “would be better off dead.” She decided to make an appointment after she attended her good friend’s wedding and found she did not enjoy any of it.\n\nTwo months previously, Ms. Smith had seen a psychiatrist for several weeks and received fluoxetine. She reluctantly gave it a try, discontinuing it quickly because it made her feel even more tired. She had also dropped out of therapy, indicating that the psychiatrist did not seem to understand her.\n\nMs. Smith lived with her husband of 13 years and two school-age children. Her husband’s parents lived next door. She said her marriage was good, although her husband suggested she “go see someone” so that she would not be “pacing and yelling at everyone all the time.” While historically sociable, she now rarely talked to her own mother and sisters, much less her friends. Previously a regular churchgoer, she had quit attending because she felt her faith was “weak.” Her pastor had always been supportive, but she had not contacted him with her problems because “he wouldn’t want to hear about these kinds of issues.”\n\nMs. Smith described herself as having been an outgoing, friendly child. She grew up with her parents and three siblings. She recalled feeling quite upset at age 10–11 when her parents divorced and her mom remarried. Because of fights with other kids at school, she met with a school counselor with whom she felt a bond. Unlike the psychiatrist she had recently consulted, Ms. Smith felt the counselor did not “get into my business” and helped her recover. She said she became quieter as she entered junior high school, with fewer friends and little interest in studying. She married her husband at age 20 and worked in retail sales until the birth of their first child when she was 23 years old.\n\nMs. Smith had not used alcohol since her first pregnancy, and she denied any use of illicit substances. She also denied past and current use of prescribed medications, other than the brief trial of the antidepressant medication. She reported generally good health.\n\nOn mental status examination, Ms. Smith was a casually groomed young woman who was coherent and goal directed. She had difficulty making eye contact with the white middle-aged therapist. She was cooperative but mildly guarded and slow to respond. She needed encouragement to elaborate her thinking. She was periodically tearful and generally appeared sad. She denied confusion, psychosis, hallucinations, current suicidal ideation, and homicidality. Cognition, insight, and judgment were all considered normal.",

Her supervisor had referred Ms. Taylor to the EAP after she had become tearful while being mildly criticized during an otherwise positive annual performance review. Somewhat embarrassed, she told the consulting psychiatrist that she had been “feeling low for years” and that hearing criticism of her work had been “just too much.”\n\nA native of western Canada, Ms. Taylor came to the United States to pursue graduate studies in chemistry. She left graduate school before completing her doctorate and began work as a laboratory technician. She reported feeling frustrated with her job, which she saw as a “dead end,” yet feared that she lacked the talent to find more satisfying work. As a result, she struggled with guilty feelings that she “hadn’t done much” with her life.\n\nDespite her troubles at work, Ms. Taylor felt that she could concentrate without difficulty. She denied ever having active suicidal thoughts, yet sometimes wondered, “What is the point of life?” When asked, she reported that she occasionally had trouble falling asleep. However, she denied any change in her weight or appetite. Although she occasionally would go out with coworkers, she said that she felt shy and awkward in social situations unless she knew the people well. She did enjoy jogging and the outdoors. Although her romantic relationships tended to “not last long,” she felt that her sex drive was normal. She noted that her symptoms waxed and waned but had remained consistent over the past 3 years. She had no symptoms suggestive of mania or hypomania.\n\nMs. Taylor was an only child. Growing up, she had a close relationship with her father, a pharmacist who owned a drugstore. She described him as a “normal guy who liked to hunt and fish” and liked to take her hiking. Her mother, a nurse, stopped working shortly after giving birth and had seemed emotionally distant and depressed.\n\nMs. Taylor became depressed for the first time in high school when her father was repeatedly hospitalized after developing leukemia. At that time she was treated with psychotherapy and responded well. She had no other psychiatric or medical history, and her medications were a multivitamin and oral contraceptives. When offered several different treatments, she expressed a preference for a combination of medication and psychotherapy. She started taking citalopram and began a course of supportive psychotherapy. After several months of treatment, she revealed that she had been sexually abused by a family friend during her childhood. It also emerged that she had few women friends and a persistent pattern of dysfunctional and occasionally abusive relationships with men.",

She had yelled at him and then, out of the blue, ended the relationship. She felt despondent afterward, guilty and self-critical. When she called him to make up, he had refused, saying he was tired of her “PMS [premenstrual syndrome] explosions.” She had then cut herself superficially on her left forearm, which she had found to be a reliable method to reduce anxiety since she was a young teenager.\n\nShe said these mood swings came out of the blue every month and that they featured tension, argumentativeness, anxiety, sadness, and regret. Sometimes she yelled at her boyfriend, but she also got upset with friends, work, and her family. During the week in which she was “Mr. Hyde,” she avoided socializing or talking on the phone; she wouldn’t be her “usual fun self,” she said, and would alienate her friends. She was able to work when she felt “miserable,” but she did have relatively poor energy and concentration. She was also edgy and “self-pitying” and regretful that she had chosen to “waste” her youth working so hard for an uncaring financial institution.\n\nWhen she was feeling “desperate,” she would be determined to seek treatment. Soon after the onset of her period, however, she would improve dramatically, return to her old self, and not find the time to see a psychiatrist. During the several weeks after her period, she said she felt “fine, terrific, the usual.”\n\nShe said the mood swings always started 7–10 days before the start of her menstrual period, “like terrible PMS.” Her periods were regular. She had premenstrual breast tenderness, bloating, increased appetite, and weight gain. Almost as soon as her period began, she felt “suddenly good.” She denied alcohol or illicit substance use and had no history of psychotic, manic, or obsessional symptoms. She denied any suicidal thoughts and any prior suicide attempts and psychiatric hospitalizations. She denied allergies and medical problems. She took one medication, her birth control pill. Her family history was pertinent for a mother with possible depression. Ms. Wang was born in Taiwan and came to the United States at age 14 to attend boarding school. After graduating from an elite business school, she had moved in with her older sister.\n\nOn mental status examination, Ms. Wang was a fashionably dressed East Asian woman wearing tasteful jewelry and carrying a designer bag. Her hair was slightly askew. She maintained good eye contact and was pleasant and cooperative throughout the interview. Her speech was normal in rate, rhythm, and volume. She described her mood as “generally good,” and her affect was full, reactive, and mildly irritable. Her thought process was linear, and she showed no evidence of delusions, obsessions, or hallucinations. She denied suicidal and homicidal ideation.

While Mr. Young sat quietly beside her, she reported that a change had come over him during the last 6 months. He was either quiet and withdrawn or uncharacteristically irritable. He had begun to drink alcohol to excess in social situations, sometimes embarrassing her. He often came home late, or not at all, claiming to have been at the office. When away from home, he rarely answered phone calls and text messages. She wondered if he was having an affair. Mr. Young denied seeing anyone else and indicated he had just been having a hard time.\n\nAfter his wife left the psychiatrist’s office, Mr. Young reported a great deal of stress at work over the last year as he tried to deal with industry-wide setbacks and personal financial losses. He said he felt down and depressed most of the time. He reported difficulty sleeping most nights, loss of interest in his wife and children, low energy, and feelings of failure and self-criticism. He had frequent thoughts of wanting to be dead and of suicide, but he denied any suicidal intent or plans.\n\nWhen asked about the alcohol, he acknowledged that he had been drinking heavily for at least 6 months. When asked about other substances, he asked about therapeutic confidentiality and then acknowledged that he had been using cocaine several times per week for about 9 months. He kept his cocaine use from his wife because he knew she would be judgmental. In the beginning, cocaine put him in a reliably positive, optimistic mood, and he found that he could more successfully churn through large volumes of otherwise tedious and discouraging work. Although his work required some socializing in the evening, he also began to regularly go to bars in the evening just so that he would have a place to comfortably combine cocaine with alcohol. He craved the high from cocaine, went out of his way to obtain it, and spent a lot of time getting high that he would previously have been spending with his family.\n\nWhen asked to clarify the sequence of work stress, cocaine use, and depression symptoms, he reported that he had felt worried and discouraged about work for a year, but the feelings of depression, loss of interest, irritability, insomnia, and low self-esteem had not begun until about 6 months earlier, 3 months after he had begun to use cocaine regularly. He experienced those depressive symptoms most of the day every day, whether or not he had taken cocaine within the last several days.\n\nMr. Young denied any previous episodes of depression, other mood or anxiety disorders, or suicide attempts. He drank socially. He had experimented with cannabis and cocaine as a teenager but had never developed a pattern of regular use or impairment until the past year.",

        "vignette": "George Anderson, a 73-year-old married man, was referred to a psychiatrist for an evaluation of depression after screening positive on the Geriatric Depression Scale during a neurology appointment. For most of the 2 years since his diagnosis with Parkinson’s disease, Mr. Anderson had coped well and continued to engage in many of his usual activities. His wife of 49 years noted that 1–2 years before developing Parkinson’s disease, Mr. Anderson had become somewhat less enthusiastic and motivated compared with his baseline personality, but not to the point of causing any concern or impairment. The only other neuropsychiatric symptom preceding his Parkinson’s diagnosis was his wife’s report that during the past 5 years he frequently “thrashed about” while asleep.\n\nThree months prior to the referral, however, Mr. Anderson began to decline social invitations from family and friends. He reported that he had withdrawn socially because he had lost pleasure in things that used to excite him, although he denied persistent feelings of sadness or worry. He recognized that he was not his “usual self” and tried, to no avail, to give himself “pep talks.” He had worked as a high school science teacher until retirement at age 67, and reported having learned “the power of seeing the glass half full” from his students. He felt frustrated that he could not “snap out of it” for the first time in his life but was hopeful about getting professional help. He denied wishing for death, explaining that although he was not afraid of death, he wanted to enjoy life as long as possible. He added, “God does not give me more than I can handle. I can’t ask for a better family, and I have had a full life.”\n\nOther new symptoms over the prior few months included increasing fatigue, impaired concentration and memory, unintentional weight loss, and sleep-onset insomnia. Further history on his more chronic sleep symptoms revealed that, around 3:00 a.m. or 4:00 a.m. on most nights, Mr. Anderson began violently moving his extremities and moaning as though in distress, all while still seemingly asleep in bed. He often awakened his wife with these movements and occasionally struck her in his sleep. She sometimes used a different bedroom because of this. When he awoke from such an incident, he was coherent and briefly anxious, often reporting that he had been dreaming of swimming or running from something.\n\nHis wife took over driving shortly after his Parkinson’s disease diagnosis, but Mr. Anderson was otherwise independent in activities of daily living such as paying bills and managing his medications. His wife described him as “maybe a little more forgetful” over the past few years, but neither of them was concerned about this mild memory loss.\n\nPast medical history included prostate cancer (in remission), glaucoma, and gout. Labs from his recent neurology visit were unremarkable, including blood counts, serum chemistries, thyroid function, and vitamin B12 levels. Family psychiatric history was positive only for a granddaughter with ADHD. He denied past problematic substance use and all current substance use except two or three glasses of wine monthly. He denied any previous depressive episodes, psychiatric treatment, or psychiatric evaluations.\n\nOn mental status examination, Mr. Anderson was pleasant, cooperative, and interpersonally engaging. Resting tremor, shuffling gait, hypophonia, and bradykinesia all were evident at mild to moderate levels. He occasionally smiled, but his affect was difficult to fully gauge because of masked facies. He reported his mood as “blah.” There was no evidence of psychosis.\n\nOn cognitive testing, he had some difficulty on the Trail Making Test part B, figure copying, and word-list recall, the latter being helped by category prompts. On a standardized brief cognitive assessment, he scored 25 out of 30 points, which was in the normal range.",

She had recently begun an intensive outpatient program after a first lifetime hospitalization for an impulsive overdose following the breakup of a 2-year relationship. She said she had been feeling increasingly sad and hopeless for 1–2 months prior to the breakup. About a month before her admission, she began seeing a new psychotherapist who told her she had “borderline traits” and “situational mood swings.”\n\nDuring these 4–8 weeks, Ms. Bates’s mood had been moderately depressed throughout the day most days, with no diurnal variation and intact mood reactivity. She had recently gained about 10 pounds from “overeating comfort food and junk.” She denied prominent irritability or argumentativeness. She described her self-esteem as “none” and had found it hard to feel motivation or to concentrate on routine tasks. By contrast, sometimes she would have “bursts” of nonstop thinking about her estranged boyfriend and devising ways to “get him back,” alternating with “grieving his loss.” She described times of being flooded with strategies to regain his interest (including purchasing a full-page newspaper “open letter” to him) and recently found herself awake until 5:00 or 6:00 a.m. journaling or calling friends in the middle of the night “for support.” She would then “trudge through the day” without fatigue after only 2–3 hours of sleep. These symptoms began prior to her hospitalization. She denied drug or alcohol misuse and self-injurious behavior. Until this particular breakup, she denied a history of particularly intense or chaotic relationships, as well as a history of suicidal thoughts or gestures. Indeed, Ms. Bates seemed horrified by her own impulsive overdose.\n\nPreviously, Ms. Bates had seen a counselor in high school for “moodiness” and poor grades. She became “depressed” in college. At that time, she began escitalopram and psychotherapy, but improved quickly and stopped both after a few weeks. While in the hospital following her suicide attempt, she started taking vilazodone and quetiapine at bedtime “for sleep.”\n\nMs. Bates was the youngest of three children who grew up in a middle-class suburban home. She attended public school and a state college as “mostly a B student” and hoped to someday go to law school. She described herself as having been a “quiet, anxious” child and “not a troublemaker.” Her older brother abused multiple substances, although Ms. Bates said she herself had never used illicit substances. Her older sister was treated for “panic attacks and depression,” and Ms. Bates knew of several aunts and cousins whom she thought were “depressed.”\n\nOn examination, Ms. Bates was a pleasant, well-related, casually but appropriately dressed, moderately overweight woman, appearing her stated age, who made good eye contact. Her speech was somewhat rapid and verbose but interruptible and nonpressured. She had no abnormal motor movements, but she gestured dramatically and with excessive animation. Her mood was depressed, and her affect was tense and dysphoric but with full range and normal responsivity. Ms. Bates’s thought processes were somewhat circumstantial but generally coherent, linear, and logical. Her thought content was notable for passive thoughts that she might be better off dead, but without intent or plan; she had no delusions, hallucinations, or homicidal thoughts.

His boss had expressed concern after he failed to make progress on a simple project. When Mr. Campbell explained that he had been distracted by problems at home, his boss suggested that more seemed wrong. Mr. Campbell called his internist, who sent him to a neurologist, who referred him for psychiatric evaluation.\n\nMr. Campbell had encountered this problem, difficulty concentrating, before. In college, after his father died of a chronic illness, Mr. Campbell had been unable to study and had taken time off. Twice at his prior job, he experienced episodes lasting months in which he had difficulty making decisions. One of these intervals followed a romantic setback.\n\nThe patient’s mother and sister had been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and treated successfully with medication. A maternal uncle had committed suicide.\n\nThe current impairment’s onset accompanied the breakdown of Mr. Campbell’s marriage of 6 years. Two months earlier, his wife had filed for divorce, announcing that she would live in the distant city her work had taken her to. Mr. Campbell had expected to feel relief; he said his wife had been hostile throughout the marriage. He had begun to entertain fond thoughts of a coworker. Nevertheless, he felt “flat”—unable to imagine a future.\n\nCloser questioning revealed that Mr. Campbell’s problems went beyond impaired cognition. He described apathy and diminished energy. Jazz was a passion, but he no longer attended recitals—although impaired concentration probably played a role as well. Listening, the psychiatrist noted probable retardation of speech. Mr. Campbell said that his employer had mentioned that he was “moving in slow motion.” The problems were worse in the mornings. In the evenings, Mr. Campbell noticed a spark of energy. He put on music and reviewed reports that he had ignored during the workday.\n\nMr. Campbell declined to characterize himself as sad. He was pleased that the marriage was ending. But the psychiatrist was struck by her own affect in Mr. Campbell’s presence; she felt glum, pessimistic, even weepy.\n\nShe questioned Mr. Campbell at length about depressed mood, changed sleep and appetite, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, and thoughts of death. None of these attributions, he said, applied. Nor had he had indicators of disorders that can be confused with depression. Between episodes of impairment, he felt and functioned well.\n\nThe psychiatrist decided that the problem at hand was close enough to depression to warrant treatment. Factors that influenced her decision included the partial syndromal presentation, diurnal variation, periodic recurrence, lack of future orientation, and her own empathic experience. She proposed psychotherapy centered on Mr. Campbell’s decompensation in the face of loss. He insisted that he did not see the impending divorce in that light. The two agreed on brief psychotherapy supplemented by antidepressants. Within weeks, Mr. Campbell was functioning at full capacity. During the treatment, the psychiatrist was unable to elicit evidence of depressive symptoms beyond those noted in the initial history. All the same, she was convinced that the impaired concentration was a sign and symptom of something very much like major depressive disorder.",

Afterward, he became scared that he might have a hidden disease. His parents reported three “panic attacks” in the prior month, marked by anxiety, dizziness, sweats, and shortness of breath. About that same time, Logan began to complain of frequent headaches and stomachaches. Logan’s own theory was that his bodily aches were caused by his fears about being ill and about his parents going away, but the pain was still uncomfortable. He insisted he was not scared about having more panic attacks but was petrified about being left sick and alone. These illness fears developed several times a week, usually when Logan was in bed, when he “felt something” in his body, or when he heard about diseases.\n\nLogan had begun to suffer from anxieties as a young child. Kindergarten was notable for intense separation difficulties. He was briefly bullied in third grade, which led to his first panic attacks and worsening anxiety. According to his parents, “there always seemed to be a new anxiety.” These included fear of the toilet, the dark, sleeping alone, being alone, and being pestered.\n\nLogan’s most persistent fear revolved around his parents’ safety. He was generally fine when both were at work or at home, but when they were in transit, or anywhere else, he was generally afraid that they would die in an accident. When the parents were late from work or when they tried to go out together or on an errand without him, Logan became frantic, calling and texting incessantly. Logan was predominantly concerned about his mother’s safety, and she had gradually reduced her solo activities to a minimum. As she said, it felt like “he would like to follow me into the toilet.” Logan was less demanding toward his father, who believed his wife had been too soft and overprotective.\n\nLogan and his family underwent several months of psychotherapy when Logan was age 10. The father said therapy helped his wife become less overprotective, and Logan’s anxiety seemed to improve. Logan’s mother agreed with this assessment, although she said she was not sure what she was supposed to do when her son was panicking whenever she tried to leave the house or whenever he worried about getting a disease.\n\nLogan’s developmental history was otherwise unremarkable. His grades were generally good. His teachers agreed that he was quiet but had several friends and collaborated well with other children. He was quick, however, to negatively interpret the intentions of other children. For example, he tended to be very sensitive to any indication that he was being picked on.\n\nLogan’s family history was pertinent for panic disorder, agoraphobia, and social anxiety disorder in the mother. The maternal grandmother was described as “at least as” anxious as Logan’s mother. The father denied psychiatric illness in his family.\n\nOn examination, Logan was a friendly, articulate boy who was cooperative and goal directed. He was generally in a “good mood” but cried when talking about his fears of dying and getting sick. He denied suicidality and hopelessness but indicated he was desperate to get over his problems before starting high school. His cognition was good. His insight and judgment appeared intact except as related to his anxiety issues.",

Medical evaluations done right after these episodes yielded normal physical exam findings, vital signs, lab results, toxicology screens, and electrocardiograms.\n\nThe patient reported a total of five such attacks in the prior 3 months, with the panic occurring at work, at home, and while driving a car. She had developed a persistent fear of having other attacks, which led her to take many days off work and to avoid exercise, driving, and coffee. Her sleep quality declined, as did her mood. She avoided social relationships. She did not accept the reassurance offered to her by friends and physicians, believing that the medical workups were negative because they were performed after the resolution of the symptoms. She continued to suspect that something was wrong with her heart and that without an accurate diagnosis, she was going to die. When she had a panic attack while asleep in the middle of the night, she finally agreed to see a psychiatrist.\n\nMs. Greco denied a history of previous psychiatric disorders except for a history of anxiety during childhood that had been diagnosed as a “school phobia.”\n\nThe patient’s mother had committed suicide by overdose 4 years earlier in the context of recurrent major depressive disorder. At the time of the evaluation, the patient was living with her father and two younger siblings. The patient had graduated from high school, was working as a telephone operator, and was not dating anyone. Her family and social histories were otherwise noncontributory.\n\nOn examination, the patient was an anxious-appearing, cooperative, coherent young woman. She denied depression but did appear worried and was preoccupied with ideas of having heart disease. She denied psychotic symptoms, confusion, and all suicidality. Her cognition was intact, insight was limited, and judgment was fair.",

        "vignette": "Nadine was a 15-year-old girl whose mother brought her for a psychiatric evaluation to help with her long-standing shyness.\n\nAlthough Nadine was initially reluctant to say much about herself, she said she felt constantly tense. She added that the anxiety had been “really bad” for several years and was often accompanied by episodes of dizziness and crying. She was generally unable to speak in any situation outside of her home or school classes. She refused to leave her house alone for fear of being forced to interact with someone. She was especially anxious around other teenagers, but she had also become “too nervous” to speak to adult neighbors she had known for years. She said it felt impossible to walk into a restaurant and order from “a stranger at the counter” for fear of being humiliated. She also felt constantly on her guard, needing to avoid the possibility of getting attacked, a strategy that really only worked when she was alone in her home.\n\nNadine tried to conceal her crippling anxiety from her parents, typically telling them that she “just didn’t feel like” going out. Feeling trapped and incompetent, Nadine said she contemplated suicide “all the time.” In the month before her mother finally brought her in for a psychiatric evaluation, Nadine had begun to cut herself on her thighs to “feel pain and relieve stress.” No one in the family was aware of this development.\n\nNadine had always been “shy” and had been teased at recess since she started kindergarten. The teasing had escalated to outright bullying by the time she was in seventh grade. The bullying took on a cultural/racially motivated undertone; Nadine and her family were of a different ethnicity than the vast majority of her schoolmates. For 2 years, day after difficult day, Nadine’s peers turned on her “like a snarling wolf pack,” calling her “stupid,” “ugly,” and “crazy.” Not infrequently, one of them would stare at her and tell her she would be better off committing suicide. One girl (the ringleader, as well as a former elementary school chum) hit Nadine on one occasion, giving her a black eye. Nadine did not fight back. This event was witnessed by an adult neighbor, who told Nadine’s mother. When Nadine’s mother asked her about the incident, Nadine denied it, saying she had “fallen” on the street. She did, however, mention to her mother “in passing” that she wanted to switch schools, but her delivery was so offhand that at the time, her mother casually advised against the switch. Nadine suffered on, sobbing herself to sleep most nights and wishing that she would not wake up.\n\nFull of hope and ideas of escape from the bullies and their narrowness, Nadine transferred to a specialty arts high school for ninth grade. Although the bullying ceased, her anxiety symptoms paradoxically worsened. She felt even more unable to venture into public spaces and felt increasingly embarrassed by her inability to develop the sort of independence typical of a 15-year-old. She said she had begun to spend whole weekends “trapped” in her home and had become scared to even read by herself in the local park. Nadine’s social anxiety had evolved into true agoraphobia. She had nightly nightmares about the bullies in her old school. Her preoccupation with suicide grew.\n\nHer parents had thought she would outgrow being shy and sought psychiatric help for her only after a teacher remarked that her anxiety and social isolation were keeping her from making the sort of grades and doing the sort of extracurricular activities that were necessary to get into a good college.\n\nNadine described her mother as loud, excitable, aggressive, and “a little frightening.” Her father was a successful tax attorney who worked long hours. Nadine described him as shy in social situations (“He’s more like me”). Nadine said she and her father sometimes joked that the goal of any evening was to avoid tipping the mother into a rage. Nadine added that she “never wanted to be anything like her mother.”",

He reported that he usually feels fine except when he is confronted with his inability to travel by airplane. His only daughter had delivered a baby in the prior year, and although he desperately wanted to meet his first granddaughter, he felt unable to fly across the Atlantic Ocean to where his daughter lived.\n\nThe patient’s anxiety about flying had begun 3 years earlier when he was on an airplane that landed during an ice storm. He had last flown a year earlier but had cried during both takeoff and landing; he had then found himself unable to return from that trip by airplane and instead took a train from Rome to Amsterdam. He had gone with his wife to an airport one additional time, 1 year prior to the evaluation, to fly to his daughter’s wedding in the United States. Despite having drunk a significant amount of alcohol, Mr. Hendricks felt unable to board the airplane. After that failed effort, he tended to feel intense anxiety when he even considered the possibility of flying. Anxiety about business trips had led him to decline a promotion as well as an external job offer. Mr. Hendricks sees himself as a “family man” and feels terrible that he failed to attend his daughter’s wedding and has not yet been able to meet his granddaughter.\n\nAside from guilt and regret related to his inability to fly, Mr. Hendricks denied other symptoms of depression and anxiety. He had increased his alcohol consumption to three glasses of wine nightly in order to “unwind,” but denied any history of alcohol complications or withdrawal symptoms. He also denied a family history of psychiatric problems.\n\nHe denied experiencing anxiety in other situations, indicating that his colleagues saw him as a forceful and successful businessman who could “easily” deliver speeches in front of hundreds of people. When specifically asked, he reported that as a child, he had been “petrified” that he might get attacked by a wild animal. This fear had led him to refuse to go on family camping trips or even on long hikes in the country. As an adult, he said that he had no worries about being attacked by wild animals because he lived in a large city and took vacations by train to other large urban areas.",

She had never before seen a psychiatrist.\n\nMs. Isaac had lived with her longtime boyfriend until 8 months earlier, at which time he had abruptly ended the relationship to date a younger woman. Soon thereafter, Ms. Isaac began to agonize about routine tasks and the possibility of making mistakes at work. She felt uncharacteristically tense and fatigued. She had difficulty focusing. She also started to worry excessively about money and, to economize, she moved into a cheaper apartment in a less desirable neighborhood. She repeatedly sought reassurance from her office mates and her mother. No one seemed able to help, and she worried about being “too much of a burden.”\n\nDuring the 3 months prior to the evaluation, Ms. Isaac began to avoid going out at night, fearing that something bad would happen and she would be unable to summon help. More recently, she avoided going out in the daytime as well. She also felt “exposed and vulnerable” walking to the grocery store three blocks away, so she avoided shopping. After describing that she had figured out how to get her food delivered, she added, “It’s ridiculous. I honestly feel something terrible is going to happen in one of the aisles and no one will help me, so I won’t even go in.” When in her apartment, she could often relax and enjoy a good book or movie.\n\nMs. Isaac said she had “always been a little nervous.” Through much of kindergarten, she had cried inconsolably when her mother tried to drop her off. She reported seeing a counselor at age 10, during her parents’ divorce, because “my mother thought I was too clingy.” She added that she had never liked being alone, having had boyfriends constantly (occasionally overlapping) since age 16. She explained, “I hated being single, and I was always pretty, so I was never single for very long.” Nevertheless, until the recent breakup, she said she had always thought of herself as “fine.” She had been successful at work, jogged daily, maintained a solid network of friends, and had “no real complaints.”\n\nOn initial interview, Ms. Isaac said she had been sad for a few weeks after her boyfriend left, but denied ever having felt worthless, guilty, hopeless, anhedonic, or suicidal. She said her weight was unchanged and her sleep was fine. The patient denied psychomotor changes. She did describe significant anxiety, with a Generalized Anxiety Disorder–7 score of 18, indicating severe anxiety.",

        "vignette": "A psychiatric transplant liaison service was called to evaluate Robert Jennings, a 50-year-old married white man, for a liver transplant in the context of an alcohol use disorder, advanced cirrhosis, and no other prior psychiatric history. Several weeks earlier, he had been hospitalized with acute alcohol-associated hepatitis and diagnosed with end-stage liver disease. Prednisolone 40 mg/day was prescribed for treatment of the hepatitis. Prior to that hospitalization, he had been unaware that his alcohol consumption was seriously damaging his health and was shocked to learn that he would eventually require a liver transplant. Upon discharge, he began an addiction treatment program that was mandatory for him to be listed for possible transplantation.\n\nOutpatient psychiatric consultation was requested by the transplant team after the patient’s family expressed concern that he had recently become increasingly irritable and anxious and seemed to be having difficulty coping with the requirements for transplantation. Mr. Jennings’s primary care physician had recently prescribed alprazolam 0.5 mg as needed for his anxiety. This was initially helpful, but after several days his family noticed he seemed more irritable, lethargic, and forgetful.\n\nWhen interviewed, the patient said that he had been tired for months prior to the diagnosis and that the fatigue had hampered his ability to work (his job required making deliveries for a shipping firm). Although the diagnosis had been a shock, he said he had left the hospital feeling “great, better than I’d felt in years.” For about a week after discharge, he described having enhanced energy and a sense of well-being, but he then began to feel anxious and restless. He slept poorly, unable to concentrate, and worried constantly about his health, finances, and family. He became less engaged with his family and stopped watching movies, normally his favorite pastime.\n\nHe denied having nightmares, flashbacks, avoidant behaviors, or racing thoughts. He also denied low mood, tearfulness, appetite changes, anhedonia, helplessness, hopelessness, or suicidality. He reported that he had started drinking daily 10 years earlier, stating that he enjoyed the taste of beer and liked socializing with friends after work. He developed tolerance to alcohol, needing to consume six to eight drinks per night to achieve the same effect. He described some withdrawal symptoms in the morning but did not drink during work hours; he underwent random testing due to his job as a truck driver. He did miss some family activities, preferring to drink, and this had been a source of marital conflict. He admitted feeling guilty about his alcohol use and its impact on him and his family. He denied using any alcohol since his hospitalization. He admitted to anger over having to undergo addiction counseling and had argued with the transplant team about this requirement. He denied having been an anxious person and considered himself able to handle most of life’s challenges without being overwhelmed. His family confirmed his description of himself and viewed his recent behavior as uncharacteristic.\n\nOn mental status examination, Mr. Jennings was a thin, jaundiced, tired-appearing man. His gait was normal, but he was fidgety while seated. He maintained eye contact and responded appropriately, although he repeatedly made comments like, “Something isn’t right” and “It’s not all in my head.” His affect was anxious and irritable, and his speech was terse. He appeared distracted but denied confusion and disorientation. He had no delusions or hallucinations. His thoughts were logical and coherent, without disorganization, and there was no latency to his responses. He scored 26 out of 30 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, missing points for recall and serial 7s. He scored in the normal range for Trail Making Test A and B but asked to have the instructions repeated for Trails B.",

He had been struggling with depressive symptoms for years and had tried fluoxetine, citalopram, and supportive psychotherapy, with minor improvement. He worked full-time but engaged in very few activities outside of work.\n\nWhen asked how he felt, Mr. King said that his mood was low, he was unable to enjoy things, and he had insomnia, feelings of hopelessness, low energy, and difficulty concentrating and making decisions. He denied current suicidality but added that a few years earlier, he had taken a full bottle of medication with the intent to kill himself. He reported that he had done this during a time that he was abusing alcohol. He denied current alcohol or illicit substance use.\n\nWhen asked about anxiety, Mr. King said he was worried about contracting diseases such as HIV. Aware of an unusually strong disinfectant smell, the interviewer asked the patient if he had any particular cleaning behaviors related to the HIV concerns. Mr. King paused and clarified that he avoided touching practically anything outside of his home. When further encouraged, Mr. King said that if he even came close to things that he considered potentially contaminated, he had to wash his hands incessantly with household bleach. He described that he felt like “something was still there” in his hands and he had to wash his hands until it felt that he had finally done it “right.”\n\nOn average, Mr. King washed his hands up to 30 times a day, spending hours on this routine. Physical contact was particularly difficult. Shopping for groceries and taking public transportation were a big problem, and he had almost given up trying to socialize or engage in romantic relationships. These behaviors had only intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic, though a co-worker liked to joke that Mr. King had been cleaning and social distancing for years before it became fashionable.\n\nWhen asked if he had other worries, Mr. King replied that he had intrusive images of hitting someone, fears that he would say things that might be offensive or inaccurate, and concerns about disturbing his neighbors. To counteract the anxiety produced by these images and thoughts, he constantly replayed prior conversations in his mind, kept diaries to record what he said, and often apologized for fear he might have sounded offensive. When he showered, he made sure that the water in the tub only reached a certain level for fear that if he were not attentive, he would flood his neighbors.\n\nMr. King used gloves at work and performed well. He had no medical problems. He spent most of his free time at home. Although he enjoyed the company of others, the fear of having to touch something if he was invited to a meal or to another person’s home was too much for him to handle.\n\nThe examination revealed a casually dressed man who smelled strongly of bleach. He was worried and constricted but cooperative, coherent, and goal directed. He denied hallucinations and other strongly held ideas. He denied a current intention to hurt himself or others. He was cognitively intact. He recognized that his fears and urges were “kinda crazy,” but he felt they were out of his control.",

She noted that since adolescence, her son had been concerned with germs, which led to long-standing hand-washing and showering rituals. During the prior 6 months, his symptoms had markedly worsened. He had become preoccupied with being infected by COVID-19 and spent the day cleaning not only his body but all of his clothing and linen. He had begun to insist that the family also wash their clothing and linen regularly, and that they keep the windows shut all the time. He allowed no visitors to their home. When the parents were occasionally exposed to other people by going outside, he insisted that they wear their masks in his presence for the ensuing 48 hours. The resulting conflicts had led to the current consultation.\n\nMr. Lewis had in the past received a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and cognitive-behavioral therapy for his symptoms. These had had some positive effects, and he had been able to complete high school successfully. Nevertheless, his symptoms had prevented him from completing college or working outside the home; he had long felt that his home was relatively germ-free in comparison to the outside world. However, over the past 6 months, he had increasingly indicated that home, too, was contaminated, including with COVID-19.\n\nAt the time of presentation, Mr. Lewis had no other obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms such as sexual, religious, or other obsessions; appearance or acquisition preoccupations; or body-focused repetitive behaviors. However, in the past he had also experienced obsessions relating to fears of harming himself or others, together with associated checking compulsions (e.g., checking that the stove was switched off). He had a childhood history of motor tics. During high school, he found that marijuana reduced his anxiety. He denied having had access to marijuana and other psychoactive substances since leaving school.\n\nMr. Lewis was interviewed over video using a telehealth system. He appeared disheveled and unkempt. He was completely convinced that COVID-19 had contaminated his home and that his washing and cleaning were necessary to stay uninfected. When challenged with information about COVID-19’s mode of spread, he answered that COVID-19 might come into the home through an open window or the sweat of visitors, and his masked parents could certainly get infected by going to the grocery store. He added that his parents had tried to convince him that he was excessively worried, but he did not believe them. In fact, his worries kept returning even when he tried to think of something else.\n\nThere was no evidence of hallucinations or of a formal thought disorder.

Since age 13, he had been excessively preoccupied with his “scarred” skin, “thinning” hair, “asymmetrical” ears, and “wimpy” and “inadequately muscular” body build. Although he looked normal, Mr. Mancini was completely convinced that he looked “ugly and hideous,” and he believed that other people talked about him and made fun of him because of his appearance.\n\nMr. Mancini spent 5–6 hours a day compulsively checking his disliked body areas in mirrors and other reflecting surfaces such as windows, excessively styling his hair “to create an illusion of fullness,” pulling on his ears to try to “even them up,” and comparing his appearance with that of others. He compulsively picked his skin, sometimes using razor blades, to try to “clear it up.” He lifted weights daily and regularly wore several layers of T-shirts to look bigger. He almost always wore a cap to hide his hair. He had received dermatological treatment for his skin concerns but felt it had not helped.\n\nMr. Mancini missed several months of high school because he was too preoccupied to do schoolwork, felt compelled to leave class to check mirrors, and was too self-conscious to be seen by others; for these reasons, he was unable to attend college. He became socially withdrawn and did not date “because no girl would want to go out with someone as ugly as me.” He often considered suicide because he felt that life was not worth living “if I look like a freak” and because he felt isolated and ostracized because of his “ugliness.” His parents expressed concern over his “violent outbursts,” which occurred when he was feeling especially angry and distressed over how he looked or when they tried to pull him away from the mirror.\n\nMr. Mancini reported depressed mood, anhedonia, worthlessness, poor concentration, and suicidal ideation, all of which he attributed to his appearance concerns. To self-medicate his distress over his appearance, he drank alcohol and smoked marijuana. He used protein powder to “build up muscle” but denied use of anabolic steroids or other performance-enhancing drugs or drugs of abuse. He had distressing and problematic anxiety in social situations during his late teens that he attributed to feeling “stupid,” but he denied recent social anxiety that was unrelated to his appearance concerns.\n\nMr. Mancini had no significant medical history and was taking no medication. His mother had obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).\n\nMr. Mancini was neatly dressed and groomed and wore a baseball cap. He had no obvious physical defects. His eye contact was poor. He was oriented and grossly cognitively intact. His affect was irritable; his mood was depressed, with passive suicidal ideation. He had no psychomotor abnormalities; his speech was normal. He was completely convinced that he was ugly and was certain that other people talked about him and laughed at him because of his physical appearance; he had no other psychotic symptoms.

She had never taken any psychiatric medication but had completed a course of cognitive-behavioral therapy for a previous depressive episode 5 years earlier.\n\nMs. Nichols’s medical history was unremarkable. She lived alone in a two-bedroom apartment and had no family or friends nearby. She had a university degree and worked as a part-time sales assistant in a charity thrift shop. She said she had dated in college but had “somehow been too busy” in recent years.\n\nOn initial examination, she was an articulate, well-dressed woman who was coherent and cooperative. She was clearly in a low mood. She complained about poor concentration and difficulties getting organized. She denied any substance misuse.\n\nThe clinician noted that Ms. Nichols’s purse was filled with bills and other papers. When asked, the patient initially shrugged it off, indicating that she “carried around my office.” When the interviewer inquired further, it emerged that Ms. Nichols had had difficulty discarding important business papers, newspapers, and magazines for as long as she could remember. She felt that it all started when her mother got rid of her old toys when she was age 12. Now, many years later, Ms. Nichols’s apartment had become filled with books, stationery, crafts, plastic packages, cardboard boxes, and all sorts of other things. She said she knew it was a little crazy, but these items could be handy one day. She said, “Waste not, want not.” She also reported that many of her possessions were beautiful, unique, and irreplaceable, or had strong sentimental value. The thought of discarding any of these possessions caused her great distress.\n\nOver a series of interviews, the clinician developed a clearer understanding of the extent of the problem. Rooms in Ms. Nichols’s apartment had begun to fill when she was in her early 30s, and by the time of the interview, she had little room to live. Her kitchen was almost entirely full, so she used a mini fridge and a toaster oven that she had wedged into piles of paper in the hallway. She ate her meals in the only available chair. At night, she moved a pile of papers from the bed onto that chair so she could sleep. Ms. Nichols continued to buy from the charity thrift store where she worked and also picked up daily free newspapers that she planned to read in the future.\n\nEmbarrassed by the condition of her apartment, she had told no one about her behavior and had invited no one into her apartment for at least 15 years. She also avoided social functions and dating, because—despite being naturally sociable and very lonely—she knew she would be unable to reciprocate with invitations to her home. She was surprised to have told the clinician, because she had not told even her own mother, but she would like help. She declined the clinician’s offer of a home visit or a telehealth visit but did offer some photographs of her living room from her telephone’s camera. The photographs showed furniture, papers, boxes, and clothes piled from floor to ceiling.\n\nMs. Nichols described long-standing feelings of sadness and loneliness, as well as anxiety whenever she tried to clean up or whenever someone tried to befriend her. She denied other psychiatric symptoms, including delusions, hallucinations, obsessions, and compulsive behavior.",

        "vignette": "Zoe Oliver was a 22-year-old single woman who presented to her general practitioner after reading a magazine article about trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder). She had never previously told anyone other than her mother about her hair pulling, but the magazine had indicated that it was fairly common and treatable. She was pessimistic that anything would work, but she and her mother agreed that she should seek help.\n\nMs. Oliver’s hair pulling most often took place as a ritual when she returned home from her job as a paralegal. She would search for hairs of a particular texture from the crown of her head (though she also pulled from her eyebrows, eyelashes, and pubic region). She felt intense relief if the hair came out with its root. She would then typically bite off the root of the hair and swallow the rest of the hair. She had never experienced any gastrointestinal symptoms after hair swallowing. She said the hair pulling had begun at age 12, and she had never known anyone with similar behaviors.\n\nMs. Oliver fought hard to stop the behavior and, at times, had been able to stop for several months at a time. When the hair pulling returned, she would again feel ashamed and angry at herself. Scarves and hats covered the bald patch, but she would usually withdraw from friends and boyfriends to avoid being caught.\n\nEven when demoralized about the behavior, Ms. Oliver did not have vegetative symptoms of depression. Aside from fears of being found out, she lacked prominent anxiety. She denied obsessions, compulsions, hoarding, tics, and preoccupations with either bodily defects or having an illness. She also had no history of a range of other body-focused repetitive behaviors, such as lip biting or cheek chewing, in either herself or her close family members.\n\nWhen asked what she would do if she could not find the “right” kind of hair to pull, she admitted that she would often pick at her skin or at a scab. The scab’s coming off in just the right way led to a feeling of relief that was similar to that which she experienced when hair pulling. She would also sometimes chew and swallow her scabs. Ms. Oliver often picked at scabs on her back so that the lesions would not be easily visible to others. Nevertheless, the resultant scarring did lead her to avoid situations like beach parties and dates and other situations where her behavior might be exposed.",

        "vignette": "Adriana was a 4-year-old girl referred to an early childhood mental health care clinic for evaluation of “dangerous behaviors.” The parents were particularly concerned that Adriana maintained poor boundaries, was impulsive, and was too quick to trust strangers.\n\nAdriana had been adopted from an Eastern European orphanage at age 29 months. At the time of the adoption, Adriana’s medical records were reviewed by a local pediatrician, who found no problems aside from growth parameters that were all below the 5th percentile. When the adoptive parents met her at the orphanage, Adriana approached without shyness and visited easily with them. The parents had been pleasantly reassured by the child’s happy demeanor and her spontaneous, warm hugs.\n\nNot long after her adoption, Adriana began to clearly seek out her mother for comfort when distressed or hurt. At most other times, however, Adriana did not distinguish between strangers and her family. In the grocery store, she would warmly hug whoever was waiting next to them in line. In group and family settings, she would frequently try to sit in the laps of people she had barely met. Once, at a shopping mall, she tried to leave with another family. Her parents were concerned that this behavior might put her at risk of abduction or abuse.\n\nCompared with other children her age, Adriana had trouble taking turns and sitting for circle time at school. She interrupted, intruded into classmates’ play space, and occasionally hit others. Small triggers upset her for prolonged periods. She had trouble soothing herself but would generally calm down if held by her teacher or a parent.\n\nAdriana lived with her adoptive mother and father and her 12-year-old brother, who was the biological child of her parents. Her mother stayed home for Adriana’s first year in the United States, but Adriana had been attending a half-day child care program for the past year. Her mother noted progress in the child’s development, although she remained language delayed, with comprehension better than productive language. She was slower than classmates in developing school readiness skills, but her gross and fine motor skills were considered average. Her sleep and appetite were fine. She had gained weight, but her head circumference remained just below the 5th percentile.\n\nOn examination, she was a pleasant, well-groomed girl who appeared younger than her age. She spoke little but did appear to pay attention to the interviewer. Within a few minutes, she tried to crawl onto the interviewer’s lap.",

        "vignette": "Traumatic Event: Bethany Pinsky, age 23, had gone to a theater to see the local premiere of a big-budget movie. As she settled into her seat, waiting for the show to begin, a young man in a ski mask suddenly appeared in front of the screen. Brandishing an assault rifle, he fired directly into the audience. She saw many people get shot, including the woman sitting next to her. People all around began screaming, and there was a confused stampede for the exit door. Terrified, she somehow fought her way to the exit and escaped, uninjured, to the parking lot, where police cars were just arriving.\n\nCharles Quigley, age 25, went to the same movie theater at the same time. He too feared for his life. Hiding behind a row of seats, he was able to crawl to the aisle and sprint to the exit. Although covered in blood, he escaped without physical injury.\n\nBethany and Charles, 2 Days Later: Two days later, both Ms. Pinsky and Mr. Quigley considered themselves “nervous wrecks.” Grateful that they were alive and uninjured, they nevertheless found themselves extremely anxious and on edge. They jumped at the slightest noise. They kept watching television for the latest information about the shooting, but every time there was actual videotaped footage of the event, they experienced panic attacks, broke out into a sweat, were unable to calm down, and could not stop thinking about the traumatic event. They could not sleep at night because of nightmares, and during the day they felt assaulted by intrusive and unwelcome memories of gunshots, screams, and their own personal terror during the event.\n\nBethany, 2 Weeks Later: Ms. Pinsky had reclaimed most of her pretraumatic thoughts, feelings, and behaviors within 2 weeks. Although traumatic reminders of the shooting sometimes led to a brief panic or physiological reaction, these did not dominate her waking hours. She no longer experienced nightmares. She knew that she would never forget what happened in that movie theater, but for the most part, her life was returning to normal and had returned to the trajectory it had been following before the shootings occurred.\n\nCharles, 2 Weeks Later: Mr. Quigley had not recovered 2 weeks later. He felt emotionally constricted and unable to experience pleasant or positive feelings. He jumped at the slightest sound, he was unable to focus on his work, and his sleep was fitful and marked by traumatic nightmares. He tried to avoid any reminders of the shootings but nevertheless relentlessly recalled the sound of gunfire, the screams, and the sticky feel of the blood pouring out of his neighbor’s chest and onto him as he hid behind the seats. He felt episodically disconnected from his surroundings and from himself. He viewed his life as having been changed by this traumatic experience.",

        "vignette": "Dylan, a 15-year-old high school student, was referred to a psychiatrist for help in dealing with stress from being involved in a serious automobile accident 2 weeks earlier. On the day of the accident, Dylan was riding in the front passenger seat when, as the car was pulling out of a driveway, it was struck by an oncoming SUV that was speeding through a yellow light. The car he was in was hit squarely on the driver’s side, which caused the car to roll over once and come to rest right side up. The collision of metal on metal made an extremely loud noise. The driver of the car, a high school classmate, was knocked unconscious for a short period and was bleeding from a gash in his forehead. Upon seeing his injured friend, Dylan became afraid that his friend might be dead. His friend in the back seat of the car was frantically trying to unlatch her seat belt. Dylan’s door was jammed, and Dylan feared that their car might catch fire while he was stuck in it. After a few minutes, the driver, Dylan, and the other passenger were able to exit through the passenger doors and move away from the car. They realized that the driver of the SUV was unharmed and had already called the police. An ambulance was on its way. All three were transported to a local emergency room, where they were attended to and released to their parents’ care after a few hours.\n\nDylan had not had a good night’s sleep since the accident. He often awoke in the middle of the night with his heart racing, visualizing oncoming headlights. He was having trouble concentrating and was unable to effectively complete his homework. His parents, who had begun to drive him to and from school, noticed that he was anxious every time they pulled out of a driveway or crossed an intersection. Although he had recently received his driving permit, he refused to practice driving with his father. He was also unusually short-tempered with his parents, his younger sisters, and his friends. He had recently gone to see a movie but had walked out of the theater before the movie started; he complained that the sound system was too loud. His concerned parents tried to talk to him about his stress, but he would irritably cut them off. After doing poorly on an important exam, however, he accepted the encouragement of a favorite teacher to go to a psychiatrist.\n\nWhen seen, Dylan described additional difficulties. He hated that he was “jumpy” around loud noises, and he could not shake the image of his injured and unresponsive friend. He had waves of anger toward the driver of the SUV. He reported feeling embarrassed and disappointed in himself for being reluctant to practice driving. He stated that about 5 years earlier, he had witnessed the near-drowning of one of his younger sisters. Also, he mentioned that this past month was the first anniversary of his grandfather’s death.",

        "vignette": "Eric Reynolds, a 75-year-old retired electrician, sought help at the Veterans Affairs outpatient mental health care clinic because of his “very short fuse” and tendency to be “easily triggered.” Mr. Reynolds indicated that he had had these symptoms for decades, but that he had finally agreed to get treated because his wife seemed desperate that he get in better control.\n\nMr. Reynolds indicated that he always felt on guard, especially while in public. When unexpectedly startled by sudden noises, he tended to fly into a rage. That was apparently one reason he had chosen to be a self-employed electrician: he could work by himself. Similarly, he enjoyed hunting and gardening, activities that he could enjoy in quiet solitude.\n\nReluctantly, he described intrusive memories of watching his fellow soldiers die in the field, which caused him enormous shame, guilt, and sadness, Several times a week, he awakes in a panicky sweat after a combat nightmare, although, as he said, “It’s ridiculous. Those guys have been dead for 50 years.”\n\nAlthough these symptoms are very distressing, Mr. Reynolds is most worried about his “hair-trigger” temper. Without cause, he finds himself antagonizing other drivers who cut him off, confronting strangers who stand too close to him in checkout lines, and shifting into “attack mode” when approached from behind by others. He springs into this aggressive mode automatically, without a thought or consideration of the circumstances. Although he keeps a handgun in the console of his car for self-protection, Mr. Reynolds has no intention of harming others. He is always remorseful after a threatening incident and worries that he might inadvertently hurt someone. Most recently, while drifting off to sleep on his physician’s examination table, a nurse touched his foot, and he leapt up and began cursing in a threatening manner. He felt as if he were back on guard duty, when he was accidentally dozing, and an incoming mortar round stunned him into action. His reaction scared both the nurse and himself.\n\nMr. Reynolds’s symptoms apparently began soon after he left Vietnam, where he served as a field radio operator. He never sought help for his symptoms, apparently because of his independent and self-reliant nature. After retirement as a self-employed electrician, he spent almost all of his time at home. During these past few years, his wife and adult children became more aware of his various symptoms, including how they were putting a severe strain on his family relationships and overall happiness.\n\nMr. Reynolds was raised in a loving family that struggled financially as Midwestern farmers. At age 20, Mr. Reynolds was drafted into the U.S. Army and deployed to Vietnam. He described himself as having been upbeat and happy prior to his army induction. He said he enjoyed basic training and his first few weeks in Vietnam, until one of his comrades got killed. At that point, all he cared about was getting home alive, even if it meant killing others. His personality changed from that of a happy-go-lucky farm boy to a terrified, overprotective soldier. Upon returning to civilian life, he managed to get a graduate business degree, but he became a self-employed electrician because of his need to stay isolated in his work. In his retirement, he hoped to volunteer, garden, and get some “peace and quiet.” It turned out, however, that his retirement was much like the rest of his adult life: although he could occasionally settle into one of his hobbies, most of his days were filled with tension, guilt, and arguments.\n\nDespite having used alcohol and marijuana during his early adulthood, he had not consumed excessive alcohol for several decades or used marijuana since the age of 30. He had no legal history.\n\nOn examination, Mr. Reynolds was a well-groomed man who appeared anxious and somewhat guarded. He was coherent and articulate. His speech was at a normal rate, but the pace accelerated when he discussed disturbing content. He denied depression but was anxious. His affect was somewhat constricted but appropriate to content. His thought process was coherent and linear. He denied all suicidal and homicidal ideation. He had no psychotic symptoms, delusions, or hallucinations. He had very good insight. He was well oriented and seemed to have above-average intelligence.",

        "vignette": "Franklin Sims was a 21-year-old single African American man who sought treatment at a university-affiliated community mental health care clinic because he felt “stressed out,” withdrawn from friends, and “worried about money.” He said he had been feeling depressed for 3 months, and he attributed the “nosedive” to the end of a 3-year romantic relationship shortly after he and his girlfriend had seriously discussed marriage.\n\nMr. Sims, the son of working-class parents, had supported himself financially since high school and was accustomed to feeling nervous about making ends meet. He was angered by his girlfriend’s decision to end the relationship, particularly her failure to understand his concerns about establishing financial stability. He increasingly ruminated about money, his grades, and his future.\n\nMr. Sims was a full-time undergraduate employed as a full-time midnight-shift warehouse worker. He was accustomed to this schedule, but he had increasingly found it difficult to concentrate in class after staying awake all night at the warehouse. When he had a day off, his sleep and energy were fine, and he still enjoyed hanging out with his friends. His appetite was unchanged, and his physical health was good. His grades had recently declined, however, and he had become increasingly discouraged about money and about being his family’s first college student. His parents did not understand why he had decided to attend an out-of-state university, and he was increasingly dissatisfied with life on the predominantly white college campus after some recent experiences of racial discrimination. He had not previously sought any type of mental health care services, but a supportive cousin suggested that he see a therapist after he had told her that he sometimes just felt like giving up.\n\nMr. Sims was an only child—a self-described “good student and popular kid.” High school was complicated by his parents’ periodic unemployment, financial strains, and related marital difficulties.\n\nHe started drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana in ninth grade, but neither had ever caused him difficulty. At the time of the evaluation, he said he occasionally had a beer or marijuana cigarette at parties, but that he didn’t have the time, money, or inclination to get intoxicated.\n\nOn examination, Mr. Sims was punctual, cooperative, pleasant, attentive, appropriately dressed, and well groomed. He spoke coherently. He appeared generally worried and constricted, but he smiled appropriately several times during the interview. He said he felt bad about his declining grades, but he denied feeling guilty or worthless. He had a quiet, dry sense of humor. He denied current suicidality, homicidality, and psychosis. He was cognitively intact, and his insight and judgment were considered good.",

        "vignette": "The psychiatric consultation-liaison service at a large hospital was asked to “rule out depression” in Gabriela Trentino, a 65-year-old woman with recurrent lung cancer, after she was noted to display sad affect and tearfulness on morning rounds.\n\nMs. Trentino was a widowed Italian American homemaker with two grown sons. She had just been admitted to the medical service for shortness of breath. She was subsequently found to have a unilateral pleural effusion. Ms. Trentino had already been through several rounds of chemotherapy over the prior few months. At the time of the consultation, she was awaiting the results of thoracentesis to assess for pulmonary metastases.\n\nInterviewed separately, Ms. Trentino and her two sons agreed that until this hospitalization, she had never previously been especially depressed or anxious but had instead been the family’s “rock.” She had never seen a therapist, taken psychiatric medication, or used alcohol, opiates, or illicit drugs. Her family history was notable for a father who drank to excess, which she described as the reason she had never tasted alcohol.\n\nOn examination, the patient was a well-groomed woman sitting in bed with an oxygen nasal cannula in place, wringing her hands and dabbing at her eyes with a wet tissue. She was cooperative and coherent. She was visibly dysphoric, with a constricted, worried affect. She reported being extremely worried about the pending thoracentesis study. She knew that metastases could mean “a death sentence” and said, “I want to be alive for my son’s marriage this year.” She added tearfully, “I’ve been through so much with the illness already.  . . . When is it going to stop?”\n\nMs. Trentino endorsed poor sleep and impaired concentration since her admission to the hospital 5 days earlier. She had been eating less than usual. She said she was “too sad and worried” to do her usual daily crossword. She denied confusion and psychotic symptoms. She appeared cognitively intact, and her Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 29 out of 30, with 1 lost point for incorrect recall of an object after 5 minutes. She adamantly denied suicidal ideation, again speaking of her love for her two children.\n\nMs. Trentino’s vital signs were notable for an oxygen saturation of 94% on room air (corrected to 99% on nasal cannula), and her chest X ray showed a large left-sided pleural effusion. Neurological examination was unremarkable. Her basic lab results were otherwise within normal limits. Collateral information from nursing staff indicated that she rang her call bell frequently throughout the day to ask about medication and test details.\n\nDiscussion with the patient’s family members revealed appropriate concern about their mother’s health, as well as frustration over her psychological state. As one of the sons told the psychiatric consultant, “We understand this is a stressful time for Mom, but all she does in the hospital is cry all day and keep on asking us the same questions over and over again. She’s usually the pillar of the family, and now she’s needy and pessimistic. Can you do something?”",

Upon arrival, Hannah had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8, indicating severe compromise. She was intubated and admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. After stabilization over several days, she was admitted to an inpatient psychiatric unit. Current regulatory practice mandates suicide screening for all patients; in this case, Hannah screened positive for suicidal ideation, plan, and attempt on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS).\n\nWhile Hannah was intubated, her parents and her best friend agreed that she appeared to have been in her usual good mood until the evening of the overdose. The best friend reported that a different friend had texted Hannah that she had seen Hannah’s boyfriend kissing another girl. Within a couple of hours of reading that text, Hannah was found by her parents, confused and barely arousable. On her desk was a note: “I just want to sleep forever.” The parents immediately called an ambulance.\n\nPsychiatric history was notable for an absence of depression, suicidal ideation, self-injurious behaviors, mania, or psychosis. She had no previous psychiatric contacts, hospitalizations, or psychotherapy. According to her parents and her best friend, Hannah never used cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, or other illicit drugs. She had no legal history\n\nHannah lived with her parents and two younger sisters. Her academic performance as an eleventh grader at a local public school was stellar. She reported that she hoped to be a physician or attorney. Her best friend said she had been cheerful earlier in the day. Family psychiatric history was notable for her mother having an anxiety disorder for which she was prescribed clonazepam and alprazolam. As a late adolescent, the mother had also made two suicide attempts by medication overdose. Her father had chronic back pain from a sports injury, for which he took oxycodone. Extended family history was notable for a paternal uncle with an alcohol use disorder. No one in the extended family had committed suicide.\n\nAfter she was extubated, Hannah said she felt fine, and that the suicidal feelings were completely gone. She also said that she had been doing well until the minute she read about her boyfriend kissing another girl. Hannah denied having any disturbances of mood, anxiety, sleep, appetite, energy, or concentration, either at the time of the evaluation or in the weeks leading up to the overdose. She denied somatic complaints, psychotic features, and any history of self-injury, such as cutting. She denied any history of trauma or substance use. She recalled that the thought to die came “out of the blue,” and that she immediately wrote the suicide note and gathered medications from her parents’ medicine cabinet. In retrospect, she was horrified by the overdose and grateful that she was alive.\n\nHannah continued to deny depression and suicidality throughout her hospitalization. She was discharged to outpatient care within the hospital clinic. No psychotropic medication was prescribed. She was seen weekly for cognitive-behavioral therapy that focused on coping skills when angry or disappointed. After 6 months, Hannah was noted to be doing well and to have been consistently free of suicidal ideation, intent, or behavior. At that point, Hannah, her parents, and the psychologist agreed to end the treatment, with the understanding that she would restart treatment should she experience any trouble coping.",

        "vignette": "Isaac Ulysse, a 29-year-old surgery resident at a large urban hospital, was referred to his employee assistance program because of “burnout.” Dr. Ulysse’s supervisors had become concerned about his appearing increasingly distracted and sad. After performing very well at their medical school and during the first 2 years of surgery training, Dr. Ulysse was now manifesting some problems, with his most recent performance review being notable for uncharacteristic sloppiness and lateness. Dr. Ulysse had shrugged off two referrals, but after being told that he was being released from work until he got clearance from psychiatry, he agreed to an evaluation.\n\nDr. Ulysse stated that he was fine, “just a little burned out.” He’d always prided himself on having more energy than everyone else, but he’d started getting worn down during the COVID-19 pandemic. He said he was sleeping poorly, was always tired, and was having trouble concentrating. After about 20 minutes, he asked if he could leave, that he felt better already. The psychiatrist explained that she would need to meet with him at least a few times before she could allow him to go back to work.\n\nReminded that he wasn’t yet ready to go back to work, Dr. Ulysse appeared to slump in his seat. When the psychiatrist asked him to say more, he replied that he hated being this way, hated being weak.\n\nHe said he knew he had burnout. He’d read up on it, and he felt exhausted, cynical about his being a “cog in the medical-industrial complex,” and less able to finish his daily work. He thought he might also have a depressive disorder, given that he was sad just about every day and also felt tired, worthless, and unable to sleep and concentrate normally. He said this had been going on for 12 or 18 months, but he’d been “good at hiding things until recently.” Dr. Ulysse asked whether the psychiatrist could diagnose him with burnout, since he’d prefer not to get a label that is a “career killer, at least for a surgeon.” He said he would be completely adherent with an antidepressant medication if the psychiatrist would let him go back to work. When asked if he felt suicidal, he responded that he had always thought that was a ridiculous question: “If you’re really serious about suicide, why tell somebody who has 911 on speed dial? But no, I’m not going to kill myself.”\n\nAt this point, the psychiatrist asked for more background information. Dr. Ulysse was the only child born to a pharmacist and a French professor, who had left Haiti when he was born. He had grown up in a suburban area where he was often the only Black child in his grade. When asked if that was difficult for him, he looked skeptical. “Yeah,” he said, “I know all about microaggressions and structural racism, all that stuff, but my strategy was to always be smarter, funnier, nicer, and more athletic than everybody else. I always had a confident smile on my face, and now nothing makes me happy. My nickname at my fancy high school was Superman. I literally dated the homecoming queen, and nobody seemed to mind about the Black/white thing.” At that point, he laughed and added, “well, except for my Gran, my dad’s mother, who lived with us when I was growing up. She thought I was asking for trouble.”\n\nAfter a few moments of silence, Dr. Ulysse began to quietly cry. When asked to say more, he explained that his parents worked “all the time” when he was young, so his grandmother lived with them and took care of him throughout his school years. She had died of COVID-19 about 18 months earlier. Since then, he described thinking about her “all the time” and having become increasingly preoccupied by his failure to convince her to get the COVID vaccine.\n\nHe said he knew it was ridiculous, but he had partially believed her when she had insisted that she was able to protect everyone in the family from the virus. “Did I mention my Gran was a Catholic witch, and a very good one?” Dr. Ulysse added that although he knew she was dead, part of him continued to expect her to walk through the door, and he looked up multiple times every day, expecting her to be there. He spent long hours reviewing his inability to convince her to get the vaccine as well as his decision not to visit her for months for fear of infecting her. He awoke with nightmares most nights. He didn’t remember the content of the dreams very well, but they tended to be about his grandmother disappearing and him being unable to help. He noted that he had become increasingly angry and bitter at colleagues, his parents, and his ex-girlfriend. Since she had moved out of their apartment 6 months earlier, he hadn’t spoken to her or seen any of his friends. His parents called frequently and have tried to “kidnap” him for a weekend with family, but they appear to have gotten frustrated that he was being so stubborn. He said that he was okay watching TV—where he focused on “pestilence and wars”—but he just felt too numb to talk to people. He also stated that he barely knew who he was anymore, and that his job as a surgery trainee had come to seem irrelevant if it meant that he couldn’t even help his family. Although he was definitely not going to kill himself, and he knew the whole idea was “stupid,” he did daydream almost every day about being dead so that he could see his grandmother again.",

        "vignette": "Judith Vaughan was a 29-year-old special education teacher who sought a psychiatric consultation because “I’m tired of always being sad and alone.”\n\nThe patient reported chronic, severe depression that had not responded to multiple trials of antidepressants and mood stabilizer augmentation. She reported greater benefit from psychotherapies based on cognitive-behavioral therapy and dialectical behavior therapy. Electroconvulsive therapy had been suggested, but she had refused. She had been hospitalized twice for suicidal ideation and severe self-cutting that required stitches.\n\nMs. Vaughan reported that previous therapists had focused on the likelihood of trauma, but she casually dismissed the possibility that she had ever been abused. It had been her younger sister who had reported “weird sexual touching” by their father when Ms. Vaughan was 13. There had never been a police investigation, but her father had apologized to the patient and her sister as part of a resultant church intervention and an inpatient treatment for alcoholism and “sex addiction.” She denied any feelings about these events and said, “He took care of the problem. I have no reason to be mad at him.”\n\nMs. Vaughan reported little memory for her life between the ages of about 7 and 13 years. Her siblings would joke about her inability to recall family holidays, school events, and vacation trips. She explained her amnesia by saying, “I don’t remember anything because nothing happened.”\n\nShe reported a “good” relationship with both parents. Her father remained “controlling” toward her mother and still had “anger issues,” but had been abstinent from alcohol for 16 years. On closer questioning, Ms. Vaughan reported that her self-injurious and suicidal behavior primarily occurred after visits to see her family or when her parents surprised her by visiting.\n\nMs. Vaughan described being “socially withdrawn” until high school, at which point she became academically successful and a member of numerous teams and clubs. She did well in college. She excelled at her job and was regarded as a gifted teacher of autistic children. She described several friendships of many years. She reported difficulty with intimacy with men, experiencing intense fear and disgust at any attempted sexual advances. Whenever she did get at all involved with a man, she felt intense shame and a sense of her own “badness,” although she felt worthless at other times as well. She tended to sleep poorly and often felt tired.\n\nShe denied use of alcohol or drugs. She added that even the smell of alcohol made her feel like throwing up.\n\nOn mental status examination, the patient was well groomed and cooperative. Her responses were coherent and goal directed, but often devoid of emotional content. She appeared sad and constricted. She described herself as “numb.” She denied hallucinations, confusion, and a current intention to kill herself. However, thoughts of suicide were “always around.”\n\nMore specific questions led Ms. Vaughan to deny that she had ongoing amnesia for daily life, particularly denying ever being told of behavior she could not recall, unexplained possessions, subjective time loss, fugue episodes, or inexplicable fluctuations in skills, habits, and/or knowledge. She denied a sense of subjective self-division, hallucinations, inner voices, or passive influence symptoms. She denied flashbacks or intrusive memories, but she did report recurrent nightmares of being chased by “a dangerous man” from whom she could not escape. She reported difficulty concentrating, although she was “hyperfocused” at work. She reported an intense startle reaction. She said that she often found herself silently counting and singing rather than let herself daydream. She added that she was very careful, checking multiple times every night to ensure that her doors were locked. When she got anxious, she found that rearranging her furniture helped her feel safer.",

        "vignette": "Ken Waldron, a 20-year-old college sophomore, was referred by his resident advisor (RA) to the school’s mental health care clinic after he appeared depressed in the weeks following a breakup with his girlfriend. Mr. Waldron did not attend the evaluation session, telling his RA that “everybody gets bummed after a breakup—I'll be fine.” When Mr. Waldron seemed “strange and out of it,” his RA made another appointment and then accompanied Ken to the meeting.\n\nIn that initial session, Mr. Waldron was hesitant but revealed that he had been crushed by the breakup. While he had previously been an excellent student, he’d quit doing homework and just looked out the window during class. He noticed that his grades had declined markedly, but “I don’t seem to care.” Although he said he felt lonely, he also admitted to steadily deleting incoming texts, so that he rarely communicated with his friends and family.\n\nWhen asked to describe other symptoms of depression, Mr. Waldron replied that he didn’t have anything to say. He said that his mind felt blank, “as usual.” He added that he also felt increasingly detached from his physical body, going about his daily activities “like a robot.” He said he felt so disconnected that he often wondered if he were dead or living in a dream, or just had “no self.”\n\nMr. Waldron said that he’d been depressed for a few weeks after the breakup. He said he’d never been in love before and was shocked when Jill told him she needed “time apart.” For weeks afterward, he felt sad and a little desperate, but he’d continued to see friends and go to class; however, at some point, things began to change. He said he started feeling numb, unreal, and disconnected, but it was all a little fuzzy.\n\nMr. Waldron described a time-limited bout of extreme anxiety in tenth grade. At that time, panic attacks had begun and then escalated in severity and frequency over 2 months. During those attacks, he had felt very detached, as if everything around him was unreal. The symptoms sometimes lasted for several hours and were reminiscent of his current complaints. The onset appeared to coincide with his mother’s entry into a psychiatric hospital. When she was discharged, all of his symptoms cleared rapidly. He did not seek treatment at that time.\n\nMr. Waldron also described experiencing transient feelings of unreality in elementary school, just after his parents divorced and his father left young Jason and his mother, who had a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. His childhood was significant for pervasive loneliness and the sense that he was the only adult in the family. His mother was only marginally functional, with a few actively psychotic episodes. His father rarely visited but did provide enough money for them to continue to live in reasonable comfort. Jason often stayed with his grandparents on weekends, but in general, he and his mother lived a very isolated life. He did well in school and had a few close friends, but he largely kept to himself and rarely brought friends home. Jill would have been the first girlfriend to meet his mother.\n\nMr. Waldron denied using any drugs, in particular cannabis, hallucinogens, or ketamine, and his urine toxicology was negative. Although his home life featured emotional neglect by both parents and emotional abuse when his mother was actively psychotic, he denied physical or sexual abuse. He denied any psychiatric history of mania, psychosis, or other past psychiatric symptoms, except as described above. He also specifically denied amnesia, blackouts, multiple identities, hallucinations, paranoia, and other unusual thoughts or experiences.\n\nResults of routine laboratory tests, a blood toxicology screen, and a physical examination were normal, as were a brain magnetic resonance imaging scan and an electroencephalogram. Consultations with an otorhinolaryngologist and a neurologist were noncontributory.",

        "vignette": "Lourdes Zayas, a 33-year-old Puerto Rican woman born in the United States, was brought to the emergency room (ER) after she became distraught and tried to swallow bleach.\n\nThe patient, who had no previous psychiatric history, had apparently been doing fine until the day before, when her fiancé was murdered in a drug-related incident in Puerto Rico. Her family reported that Ms. Zayas reacted initially with inordinate calm. Concerned, relatives discreetly followed her around in their small apartment for several hours. She did not speak but instead engaged in repetitive, unnecessary tasks such as folding and unfolding clothes.\n\nThat afternoon, standing at the washing machine, she had cried out, grabbed a bottle of bleach, and tried to drink from it. Her brother knocked it away. She fell to the ground, shaking, screaming, and crying. This episode lasted a few seconds, after which she “lay as if dead” for a few minutes. The family recalled no tonic-clonic movements, tongue biting, or loss of sphincter control. When the ambulance arrived, Ms. Zayas was crying softly, repeating the name of her fiancé, and was generally unresponsive to questions. After medical staff treated mild burns to her lips, she was triaged to the psychiatry department.\n\nOver the next few hours, Ms. Zayas became more responsive. During a clinical interview done in Spanish, she reported being struck “numb” (insensible) by the news of her fiancé’s death and described a sense of being disconnected from her body, her emotions, and her surroundings. These symptoms were still present in the ER but diminished over several hours. She also described amnesia for what occurred from the moment when she cried out and her vision went “dark” (oscura), to when she “awoke” in the ER.\n\nWhile being kept under observation for 24 hours, Ms. Zayas had two more episodes of sudden agitation, crying, and screaming, during which she attempted to scratch her face and to leave the room. Because she responded quickly to verbal intervention and reassuring physical contact, she was not given medications or placed in restraints, but was kept on one-to-one observation. Her laboratory test results were unremarkable, as were an electroencephalogram and a lumbar puncture.\n\nOn examination, she was crying softly, her mood was sad, and she said she did not remember making a suicide attempt. She was oriented to time, person, and place; had no psychotic symptoms; and denied current suicidal ideation.\n\nMs. Zayas was transferred to an inpatient psychiatric unit for evaluation. She initially had difficulty falling asleep and had sad, scary dreams about her fiancé. She denied recalling anything from the hours after she tried to swallow bleach. She made efforts to avoid thinking about her fiancé and was disturbed by intrusive recollections of their time together, but she never met DSM-5 criteria for acute stress disorder or major depressive disorder. Her symptoms had improved significantly after 1 week. She took no medications at the hospital and was discharged after 10 days with follow-up to outpatient care. She attended a single appointment 1 month later, at which point she and her family agreed that she was episodically sad about the death of her fiancé but essentially back to her normal self. At that point, she was lost to follow-up.",

        "vignette": "Michelle Adams, a 51-year-old former hairdresser, came to a psychiatric clinic at the urging of her primary care doctor. A note sent ahead revealed that she had been tearful and frustrated at her last medical appointment, and her doctor, who had been struggling to control the patient’s persistent back pain, felt that an evaluation by a psychiatrist might be helpful.\n\nGreeting Ms. Adams in the waiting room, the psychiatrist was struck by both her appearance and her manner: here was a woman with shaggy silver hair and dark sunglasses, seated in a wheelchair, who offered a limp handshake and a plaintive sigh before asking the psychiatrist if he would mind pushing her wheelchair into his office. She was tired from a long commute, and, she explained, “Nobody on the street offered to help me out. Can you believe that?”\n\nOnce settled, Ms. Adams stated that she had been suffering from unbearable back pain for the previous 13 months. On the night “that changed everything,” she had locked herself out of her apartment and, while trying to climb in through a fire escape, had fallen and fractured her pelvis, coccyx, right elbow, and three ribs. Although she did not require surgery, she was bed-bound for 6 weeks and then underwent several months of physical therapy. Daily opioid medication had been only moderately helpful. She had seen “a dozen” doctors of various specialties and tried multiple treatments, including anesthetic injections and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation therapy, but her pain was unrelenting. Throughout this ordeal and for years previously, Ms. Adams smoked cannabis daily, explaining that a joint enjoyed in hourly puffs “softened” her pain and helped her to relax. She did not drink alcohol or use other illicit drugs.\n\nPrior to the accident, Ms. Adams had worked at a neighborhood salon for more than 20 years. She was proud to have had a large number of devoted clients, and she relished the camaraderie with her colleagues, whom she referred to as “my real family.” She had been unable to return to work since her accident on account of the pain. “These doctors keep telling me I’m good to go back to work,” she said with visible anger, “but they don’t know what I’m going through.” Her voice broke. “They don’t believe me. They think I’m lying.”\n\nShe added that although friends had initially reached out after the accident, lately they had seemed less sympathetic. She let incoming telephone calls go to voice mail most of the time because she just did not feel up to socializing on account of the pain. In the previous month, she had stopped bathing daily and gotten slack about cleaning her apartment. Without the structure of work, she often found herself up until 5:00 a.m., and pain woke her several times before she finally got out of bed in the afternoon. As for her mood, she said, “I’m so depressed it’s ridiculous.” She often felt hopeless of any possibility of living without pain but denied ever thinking of suicide. She explained that her Catholic faith prevented her from considering taking her own life.\n\nMs. Adams had never seen a psychiatrist before and did not recall ever having felt depressed prior to her accident, although she described a “hot temper” as a family trait. She spoke of only one meaningful romantic relationship, many years previously, with a woman who was emotionally abusive. When asked about any legal difficulties, she revealed several arrests for theft in her 20s. She was “in the wrong place at the wrong time,” she said, and was never convicted of a crime.",

        "vignette": "Norma Balaban, a 37-year-old married woman who worked as an administrative assistant to a university dean, was referred by her primary care physician for evaluation of depression and multiple somatic symptoms. She had been generally healthy, other than binge eating and obesity, until a year earlier and had undergone gastric bypass surgery 6 years earlier.\n\nAs she entered the consulting room, Ms. Balaban handed the psychiatrist a three-page summary of her physical concerns. Nocturnal leg spasms and daytime leg aches had been her initial concerns. She then developed sleep difficulties that led to “brain fog” and head heaviness. She had intermittent cold sensations in her extremities, face, ears, eyes, and nasal passages. Pulsating sensations in her eyes were, she thought, more pronounced after a poor night’s sleep. In recent months, she had developed difficulty urinating, menstrual irregularity, and multiple muscle complaints, including right gluteal pain with a burning sensation into her right thigh. She also had neck stiffness with accompanying thoracic back spasms.\n\nMs. Balaban’s primary care physician had evaluated the initial symptoms and then referred her to a rheumatologist and a neurologist. The rheumatologist diagnosed mechanical back pain without evidence of inflammatory arthritis. She had also diagnosed possible migraines with peripheral neuropathic and ocular symptoms. The neurologist noted that Ms. Balaban was also being evaluated by a neurologist and a neuro-ophthalmologist at a nearby medical center. The other neurologist concluded her evaluation with a provisional diagnosis of “atypical migraine variant,” noting that “the patient seemed to also have a significant degree of depression, which might be aggravating the symptoms or even be an underlying precipitating factor.” A review of tests done at the two medical centers indicated that Ms. Balaban had received the following essentially normal tests: two electroencephalograms, an electromyogram, three brain and three spinal magnetic resonance images, two lumbar puncture studies, and serial laboratory exams. Psychiatric consultation had been recommended, but the patient declined until repeatedly urged by her primary care physician.\n\nMs. Balaban initially spoke to the psychiatrist primarily about her physical complaints. She was very frustrated that despite having seen several specialists, she had received no clear diagnosis, and she was still very concerned about her symptoms. She had started taking fluoxetine and gabapentin, prescribed by her primary care physician, and experienced partial improvement in her mood and some of her pains. She found it difficult to concentrate and complete her work and was spending a lot of time on the internet researching her symptoms. For the past several months, she had kept a spreadsheet that tried to link her symptoms to her blood pressure and pulse.\n\nShe also felt bad about not spending enough time with her children or husband, but just did not have the energy. She acknowledged bouts of depressed mood over the prior year with some anhedonia and occasional thoughts of suicide (she had considered crashing her car), but no anorexia or guilt. She described having experienced premenstrual depressive symptoms for about a year.\n\nMs. Balaban had been treated for postpartum depression 6 years earlier after the birth of her second child. Family history was significant for cancer, depression, and hypertension.\n\nMs. Balaban lived with her husband and their daughters, ages 10 and 6 years. Her husband was being treated for depression. The patient had graduated from college and was the longtime administrative assistant to a dean at the local university. She grew up in a small town in a rural area. She reported a happy childhood and denied any experiences of physical or sexual abuse. There was no history of a substance use disorder.\n\nOn mental status examination, the patient was alert, casually but neatly dressed, cooperative, and not at all defensive. Her mood and affect were depressed, and she demonstrated psychomotor retardation. There were no abnormalities of thought process or content, no abnormalities of perception, and no evident cognitive dysfunction.",

        "vignette": "Oscar Capek, a 43-year-old man, was brought by his wife to an emergency room (ER) for what he described as a relapse of his chronic Lyme disease. He explained that he had been fatigued for a month and bedridden for a week. Then, saying he was too tired and confused to give much information, he asked the ER team to call his psychiatrist.\n\nThe psychiatrist reported that he had treated Mr. Capek for more than two decades. He first saw Mr. Capek for a panic attack. It resolved with surprisingly small doses of clonazepam. After that, however, Mr. Capek continued to see him for help coping with his chronic illness. Initially a graduate student pursuing a master’s degree in accounting, Mr. Capek dropped out of school over worries that the demands of his studies would exacerbate his disease. Since that time, his wife, a registered nurse, had been his primary support. He supplemented their income with small accounting jobs but limited these lest the stress affect his health.\n\nMr. Capek usually felt physically and emotionally well. He deemed his occasional fatigue, anxiety, and concentration difficulties “controllable” and did not require treatment. Mr. Capek was typically averse to psychotropic medications and took a homeopathic approach to his disease, including exercise and proper nutrition. When his panic symptoms would reemerge, he used small doses (e.g., one-quarter of a 0.5-mg lorazepam pill). His psychiatric sessions were commonly concerned about his underlying disease; he often brought articles on chronic Lyme disease for discussion and was active in a local Lyme disease support group.\n\nMr. Capek’s symptoms would occasionally worsen. However, these worsenings occurred less than yearly, and these “exacerbations” usually related to some apparent stress. The worst episode had been 1 year earlier, when his wife briefly left him following his revelation of an affair. Mr. Capek expressed shame about his behavior toward his wife—both the affair and his inability to support her. He subsequently cut off contact with the other woman and attempted to expand his accounting work. The psychiatrist speculated that similar stress was behind his current symptoms.\n\nThe psychiatrist communicated regularly with Mr. Capek’s internist. His Lyme disease tests had thus far been negative. When the internist reported this, Mr. Capek became defensive and produced literature on the inaccuracy of Lyme disease testing. Eventually, the internist and the psychiatrist agreed on a conservative treatment approach with a neutral stance regarding the disease’s validity.\n\nOn examination, Mr. Capek was a healthy, well-developed adult male. He was anxious and spoke quietly with his eyes closed. He frequently lost his train of thought, but with encouragement and patience, he could give a detailed history consistent with the psychiatrist’s account. Physical examination findings were unremarkable, and a standard laboratory screen was normal except for a slightly low hemoglobin value. The medical team chose to defer further Lyme testing, given the patient’s many past negative tests. However, on hearing about the low hemoglobin, Mr. Capek became alarmed, dismissed reassurances, and insisted that the team investigate this further.",

Before she was taken to the emergency room (ER), emergency medical services administered several doses of lorazepam, with no change in her condition. On arrival at the ER, a loading dose of fosphenytoin was administered to her; it stopped the convulsive activity. Blood tests obtained in the ER revealed therapeutic levels of her usual antiepileptics and no evidence of any infection or metabolic disturbance. Urine toxicology screens were negative for the use of illicit substances. Ms. Delcampo was admitted to the neurology service for further monitoring.\n\nDuring her admission, a routine electroencephalogram (EEG) was ordered. Shortly after the study began, Ms. Delcampo began convulsing; this prompted administration of intravenous (IV) lorazepam. When the EEG was reviewed, no epileptiform activity was identified. Ms. Delcampo was placed on video-EEG (vEEG) monitoring, and her antiepileptics were tapered and discontinued. In the course of her monitoring, Ms. Delcampo had several episodes of convulsive motor activity; however, none was associated with epileptiform activity on the EEG. Psychiatric consultation was requested.\n\nOn interview, Ms. Delcampo denied prior psychiatric evaluations, diagnoses, or treatments. She denied having depressed mood or any disturbance of sleep, energy, concentration, or appetite. She reported no thoughts of harming herself or others. She endorsed no signs or symptoms consistent with mania or psychosis. There was no family history of psychiatric illness or substance abuse. Her examination revealed a well-groomed woman, sitting on her hospital bed with EEG leads in place. She was pleasant and engaged, and she made good eye contact. Cognitive testing revealed no deficits.\n\nMs. Delcampo noted that she had recently moved to the state to begin graduate school; she was excited about starting her studies and “finally getting my career on track.” She denied any recent specific psychosocial stressors other than her move and said, “My life is finally where I want it to be.” She was future oriented and concerned about the impact that her seizures might have on her long-term health. She was worried that a protracted hospitalization might cause her to miss the first day of classes (only a week away from the time of the interview). Moreover, she was quite concerned about the costs of her hospitalization because her health insurance coverage did not begin until the school semester commenced and the payment for extended benefits coverage from her previous employer would have a significant impact on her budget.\n\nWhen the findings of the vEEG study were discussed with Ms. Delcampo, she quickly became quite irritable, asking, “So, everyone thinks I’m just making this up?” She was not calmed by her treaters’ attempts to clarify that they did not believe her to be faking her symptoms or by their reassurance that her symptoms might be helped by structured therapy. Ms. Delcampo pulled her EEG leads from her scalp, dressed herself, and left the hospital against medical advice.",

        "vignette": "A hospital-based psychiatric consultation-liaison service was called to assess possible depression in Rebecca Ehrlich, a 24-year-old woman who had been hospitalized 2 days earlier for severe abdominal pain. She had been admitted through the emergency room for the latest flare-up of her underlying Crohn’s disease. The consultation was called after the nurses became concerned that she was sad and lonely and was having a difficult time adjusting to her medical condition.\n\nMs. Ehrlich was interviewed by the medical student on the psychiatry service. The patient indicated that the pain was excruciating and that she was neither sad nor lonely but was simply visiting from out of town, so no one knew she was even in the hospital. She told the medical student that her only previous therapy had been in college, when she went to student health services to get help for anxiety about test taking and her career choice. She had successfully completed a short course of cognitive-behavioral therapy, and the anxiety had not reappeared. She denied any other psychiatric history and had never taken psychiatric medication. In college, she studied psychology and worked part-time as a hospital orderly. Ms. Ehrlich had considered a career in medicine or nursing and asked the student how he had decided to go to medical school.\n\nMs. Ehrlich reported that she had previously worked regularly and had “quite a few friends,” but that the recurrent abdominal pain had wrecked her social life and her job prospects. She had lost a job the year before because of absenteeism and had missed several job interviews due to her Crohn’s flares. She had dated as a teenager but had been in no relationships since starting college. These things “were not the end of the world, but how would you feel?” As a member of an online bowel disorders support group, Ms. Ehrlich e-mailed other members on a daily basis. She added that the only person in the family who “got” her was an aunt who also had Crohn’s disease.\n\nThe primary medical team was having difficulty obtaining collateral information from previous physicians, but the medical student was able to contact Ms. Ehrlich’s mother. She did not know the exact names or phone numbers of her daughter’s medical providers but did recall some of the hospitals and could recall, approximately, some of the physicians’ names. She added that her daughter had not wanted her to be involved in her care and had not told her she was out of town, much less that she was in the hospital. She did say that the Crohn’s disease had been diagnosed 2 years earlier, during her daughter’s last semester of college. The mother estimated that Ms. Ehrlich had been hospitalized at least six times, in contrast with the daughter’s report of two earlier hospitalizations. Neither the gastrointestinal (GI) team nor the medical student was able to locate Ms. Ehrlich’s primary gastroenterologist, whose name the patient could spell only phonetically.\n\nOn examination, Ms. Ehrlich was cooperative and conversant, and appeared comfortable. Her speech was fluent. She appeared calm and unworried about her upcoming procedures. Her thought process was linear. She denied paranoia, hallucinations, or suicidality. Attention and both recent and remote memory were intact. She acknowledged that it had been difficult living with Crohn’s disease, but she was optimistic that her symptoms would improve. She denied depressive symptoms. She looked sad at the beginning of the interview, but she appeared more engaged and euthymic the more she talked. She could not explain why the team was unable to locate her doctor and became irritated when the medical student pressed more specifically to elicit further details about her prior care. She was taken to have an endoscopy and a colonoscopy at the end of the interview.\n\nMs. Ehrlich’s endoscopy and colonoscopy results were normal. That evening, the medical student from psychiatry sat in with the GI team as they reviewed the normal results with the patient. She said she was relieved there was no longer anything seriously wrong with her. The GI team told her that she could be discharged the next morning and that she should have her internist call them. She readily agreed.\n\nAfter the GI team left, Ms. Ehrlich told the student that she was “feeling better already.” She quickly removed her own intravenous line and started to get dressed. The student went to get the primary GI team. When they returned, the patient was gone.\n\nThe medical student spent much of the next day calling hospitals and physicians that met descriptions provided by the patient and her mother. That afternoon, one of the physicians called back and indicated that he had treated Ms. Ehrlich 6 months earlier at a hospital near her mother’s home. That admission was strikingly similar: after a short hospitalization, she quickly fled from the hospital after a normal colonoscopy.",

His parents reported that he had developed constipation, with only one bowel movement in the past week, and that he had vomited earlier in the day. Teachers at his special education classroom for children with intellectual developmental disorders had written a report earlier in the week indicating that Thomas had been having difficulties since soon after transferring from a similar school in a different state about 4 months earlier. The teachers and parents agreed that Thomas often looked distressed, rocking, crying, and clutching his stomach.\n\nOne week earlier, a pediatrician had diagnosed an acute exacerbation of chronic constipation. Use of a recommended over-the-counter laxative was not helpful, and Thomas began to complain of nighttime pain. The discomfort led to a diminished interest in his favorite hobbies, which were video games and sports. Instead, he tended to stay in his room, playing with army men figurines that he had inherited from his grandfather’s collection. Aside from episodes of irritability and tearfulness, he was generally doing well in school, both in the classroom and on the playground. When not complaining of stomachaches, Thomas ate well and maintained his position at about the 40th percentile for height and weight on the growth curve.\n\nThomas’s past medical history was significant for constipation and stomachaches, as well as for intermittent headaches. All of these symptoms had worsened several months earlier, after the family moved from a house in semirural Florida into an old walk-up apartment in a large urban city in a different state. He shared a room with his younger brother (age 6 years), the product of a normal, unexpected pregnancy, who was enrolled in a regular education class at the local public school. Thomas said his brother was his “best friend.” Thomas was adopted at birth, and nothing was known of his biological parents except that they were teenagers unable to care for the child.\n\nOn medical examination in the ER, Thomas was a well-groomed boy sitting on his mother’s lap. He was crying and irritable and refused to speak to the examiner. Instead, he would repeat to his parents that his stomach hurt. On physical examination, he was afebrile and had stable vital signs. His physical examination was remarkable only for general abdominal tenderness, although he was difficult to assess because he cried uncontrollably through most of the exam.\n\nAn abdominal X ray revealed multiple small metallic particles throughout the gastrointestinal tract, initially suspected to be ingested high-lead paint flakes, as well as three 2-centimeter-long metallic objects in his stomach. A blood lead level was 20 μg/dL (whereas normal level for children is < 5 μg/dL). More specific questioning revealed that Thomas, being constipated, often spent long stretches on the toilet by himself. His parents added that although the bathroom was in the process of being renovated, its paint was old and peeling. Consultants decided that the larger foreign bodies in the stomach might not safely pass and could be accounting for the constipation. Endoscopy successfully extricated three antique toy soldiers from Thomas’s stomach.",

Their sessions focused on anxiety, not on eating behavior.\n\nUma’s eating difficulties started at age 9, when she began refusing to eat and reporting a fear that she would vomit.

At age 9, Uma was above the 25th percentile for both height and weight (52 inches, 58 pounds), but by age 11, she had essentially stopped growing and had dropped to the 5th percentile on her growth curves (52.5 inches, 55 pounds).\n\nThe only child of two professional parents who had divorced 5 years earlier, Uma lived with her mother on weekdays and with her nearby father on weekends. Her medical history was significant for her premature birth at 34 weeks’ gestation. She was slow to achieve her initial milestones but by age 2 was developmentally normal. Yearly physical examinations had been unremarkable with the exception of the recent decline of her growth trajectory. Uma had always been petite, but her height and weight had never fallen below the 25th percentile for stature and weight for age on the growth chart. Uma was a talented student who was well liked by her teachers. She had never had more than a few friends, but recently she had stopped socializing entirely and had been coming directly home after school, reporting that her stomach felt calmer when she was in her own home.\n\nFor the prior 2 years, Uma had eaten only very small amounts of food over very long durations of time. Her parents had tried to pique her interest by experimenting with foods from different cultures and of different colors and textures. None of this seemed effective in improving her appetite. They also tried to let her pick restaurants to try, but Uma had gradually refused to eat outside of either parent’s home. Both parents reported a similar mealtime pattern: Uma would agree to sit at the table but then spent her time rearranging food on her plate, cutting food items into small pieces, and crying if urged to eat another bite.\n\nWhen asked more about her fear of vomiting, Uma remembered one incident, at age 4, when she ate soup and her stomach became upset and then she subsequently vomited. More recently, Uma had developed fear of eating in public and ate no food during the school day. She denied any concerns about her appearance and said that she had first become aware of her low weight at her most recent visit to the pediatrician. When educated about the dangers of low body weight, Uma became tearful and expressed a clear desire to gain weight.",

She reported that she needed to improve her diet and exercise but felt out of control. She added that she had gone to her internist several times in recent months for stomachaches, and he finally insisted that she see a psychiatrist.\n\nMs. Hoffman had been living alone since her college graduation 2 years earlier. She had recently been promoted in her job as an accountant, and said that she enjoyed her work. She mentioned having some friends from high school and being interested in dating, but she felt too tired and sad to do much besides meet up for a quick dinner after work. She was unable to exercise because of low energy, slept poorly, and frequently had stomachaches. These symptoms and the resulting social dysfunction had caused her to feel increasingly isolated, lonely, and sad. She often found herself feeling worthless and wondering how she was going to get through the week, but she denied suicidal intent or plan.\n\nShe said she had accepted the psychiatric referral so that she could get an antidepressant medication, but “it had to be one that didn’t cause weight gain. Hopefully, I could get one that would cause weight loss, instead.” Ms. Hoffman added that she couldn’t get back to her ideal weight despite lots of effort. When asked about the effort, Ms. Hoffman grew quiet but did eventually answer: “I wasn’t going to talk about this, but I’m a ‘failed anorexic.’ I can diet for about half a day, but by dinner, I’m starving, so I eat everything I can find, and then I throw up. It’s mortifying.”\n\nMs. Hoffman reported that she had started dieting at about age 13; she noted that, in retrospect, she was “being ridiculous,” and that her weight had been fine. She said her downfall really began when she started “stress eating” in college. When she realized she had gained 10 or 15 pounds, she began to routinely skip breakfast. She often skipped lunch as well, but then, famished, she would overeat in the late afternoon and evening.\n\nBy the end of her sophomore year, Ms. Hoffman had started inducing vomiting, a practice she learned about in a magazine. She had developed her current eating pattern during her junior year and continued it after graduation: no breakfast; a “light” lunch; an “average” dinner, often with friends; and then she’d rush back to her apartment for a second dinner and a pint or two of ice cream, followed by self-induced vomiting.",

        "vignette": "Yasmine Isherwood, a 55-year-old married woman, had been in psychiatric treatment for 6 months for an episode of major depressive disorder. She had responded well to a combination of psychotherapy and medications (fluoxetine and bupropion), but she began to complain of weight gain. She was at her “highest weight ever,” which was 140 pounds (her height was 5 feet 5 inches, so her BMI was 23.3).\n\nThe psychiatrist embarked on a clarification of Ms. Isherwood’s eating history, which was marked by recurrent, distressing episodes of uncontrollable eating of large amounts of food. The overeating was not new but seemed to have worsened while she was taking antidepressants. She reported that she often worked late in her job as marketing director for a large software company, and that the eating episodes often occurred on one of 2 days per week that she happened to get home before her husband, a cardiologist at a local hospital. These “eating jags” were notable for a sense that she was out of control. She ate rapidly and alone, until uncomfortably full. She would then feel depressed, tired, and disgusted with herself. She usually binged on healthy food but also had “sugar binges” where she ate primarily sweets, especially ice cream and candy. She denied current or past self-induced vomiting, fasting, or misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or weight-loss agents. She reported exercising for an hour almost every day but denied being “addicted” to it. She did report that in her late 20s, she had become a competitive runner. At that time, she ran an average of about 35 miles per week, despite a lingering foot injury that eventually forced her to shift to swimming, biking, and the elliptical machine.\n\nMs. Isherwood stated that she had binged on food “for as long as I can remember.” She was “chunky” as a child but stayed at a normal weight throughout high school (120–125 pounds) because she was so active. She denied a history of anorexia nervosa. At age 28, when she was competitively running, she reached her lowest adult weight of 113 pounds. At that point, she felt “vital, healthy, and in control.”\n\nIn her mid-30s, she had a major depressive episode that lasted 2 years. She had a severely depressed mood, did not talk, “closed down,” stayed in bed, was very fatigued, slept more than usual, and was unable to function. This was one of the few times in her life that the binge eating stopped and she lost weight. She denied a history of hypomanic or manic episodes. Although she lived with frequent sadness, she denied other serious depressive episodes until the past year. She denied a history of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and any significant use of alcohol, tobacco, or illicit substances.\n\nThe evaluation revealed a well-nourished, well-developed female who was coherent and cooperative. Her speech was fluent and not pressured. She had a mildly depressed mood but had a reactive affect with appropriate smiles. She denied guilt, suicidality, and hopelessness. She said her energy was normal except for post-binge fatigue. She denied psychosis and confusion. Her cognition was normal. Her medical history was unremarkable, and physical examination and basic laboratory test results provided by her internist were within normal limits.",

        "vignette": "Zack was an 8-year-old boy brought to the outpatient child psychiatry clinic by his mother because of increasing tantrums and somatic complaints without an apparent cause. The mother reported that the symptoms appeared related to the nights that he spent with his aunt, another single mom with a boy similar in age to Zack. He had been close to this aunt since birth but had only recently begun to spend every Friday night with her when the mother took on a night shift at work.\n\nFor 2 months prior to the consultation, Zack would report nausea and headaches on Fridays and complain that his aunt’s house was “creepy.” He continued to visit, with reluctance, although he did once call his mother at work demanding that she pick him up, saying, “Other kids live in their own home every day of the week.”\n\nIn recent weeks, Zack screamed and hid when it came time to go to his aunt’s home. His mother became concerned that something could have “happened” to Zack during a visit. The mother struggled to reconcile this with the fact that Zack had no objections to seeing the aunt and cousin anywhere else, and he had no objection to the cousin sleeping at their home. Her sister had always been “a good mom” and was always home during the sleepovers. She did have a boyfriend, but Zack seemed to like him. In fact, Zack seemed especially excited to go to the park or ball games with his cousin and the boyfriend.\n\nZack had never previously had particularly significant separation, behavioral, or emotional issues. He achieved all developmental milestones on time. He had never seen a doctor aside from routine visits and one bad cold when he was age 3. Zack had yet to achieve consistent overnight continence, however, and did wet the bed approximately twice weekly. He had no daytime voiding symptoms or constipation. The pediatrician had told them that this was “normal” at Zack’s age. The mother had never made a big deal about the bed-wetting, and Zack had never expressed significant distress about it.\n\nFamily history was negative for all psychiatric illness on the mother’s side, and the mother said her own developmental landmarks were normal as far as she had been told. The mother knew little about Zack’s father’s developmental or family history, and she had not seen him since before Zack was born.\n\nOn mental status examination, Zack was cooperative and appeared well nourished and well cared for. He had little difficulty separating from his mother. After an initial period of warming up to the interviewer, his speech was spontaneous with a vocabulary appropriate for his age. He maintained age-appropriate eye contact. His affect was initially mildly anxious, but he rapidly calmed. Anxiety only reappeared upon discussing his sleepovers, when Zack demonstrated some fidgeting, decreased eye contact, and mild irritability directed toward his mother. When asked about the bed-wetting, Zack appeared embarrassed. He said he had wet the bed at his aunt’s house a few times and that both his cousin and his aunt’s boyfriend teased him about it. His aunt had intervened, but he described being “scared” that he would do it again.",

        "vignette": "Aidan Johns, a 30-year-old graduate student in English, visited a psychiatrist to discuss his difficulty staying asleep. The trouble began 4 months earlier, when he started to wake up at 3:00 every morning, no matter when he went to bed, and then was unable to fall back to sleep. As a result, he felt “out of it” during the day. This led him to feel increasingly worried about how he was going to finish his doctoral dissertation when he was unable to concentrate owing to exhaustion. When his sleep difficulties began, he woke with nothing particular on his mind. As the trouble persisted, he found himself dreading the upcoming day and wondering how he would teach his classes or focus on his writing if he was getting only a few hours of sleep. Some mornings he lay awake in the dark next to his fiancée, who was sleeping soundly. On other mornings he would cut his losses, rise from bed, and go very early to his office on campus.\n\nAfter a month of interrupted sleep, Mr. Johns visited a physician’s assistant at the university’s student health services, where he customarily got his medical care. (He suffered from asthma, for which he occasionally took inhaled β2-adrenergic receptor agonists, and a year earlier he had had mononucleosis.) The physician’s assistant prescribed a sedative-hypnotic, which did not help. “Falling asleep was never the problem,” Mr. Johns explained. Meanwhile, he heeded some of the advice he read online. Although he felt reliant on coffee during the day, he never drank it after 2:00 p.m. An avid tennis player, he restricted his court time to the early morning. He did have a glass or two of wine every night at dinner with his fiancée, however. “By dinnertime I start to worry about whether I’ll be able to sleep,” he said, “and, to be honest, the wine helps.”\n\nThe patient, a slender and fit-appearing young man looking very much the part of the young academic in a tweed jacket and tortoise-rimmed glasses, was pleasant and open in his storytelling. Mr. Johns did not appear tired but told the evaluating psychiatrist, “I made a point to see you in the morning, before I hit the wall.” He did not look sad or on edge and was not sure if he had ever felt depressed. But he was certain of the nagging, low-level anxiety that was currently oppressing him. “This sleep problem has taken over,” he explained. “I’m stressed about my work, and my fiancée and I have been arguing. But it’s all because I’m so tired.”\n\nAlthough this was his first visit to a psychiatrist, Mr. Johns spoke of a fulfilling 3-year psychodynamic psychotherapy with a social worker while in college. “I was just looking to understand myself better,” he explained, adding with a chuckle that as the son of a child psychiatrist, he was accustomed to people assuming he was “crazy.” He recalled always being an “easy sleeper” prior to his recent difficulties; as a child he was the first to fall asleep at slumber parties, and as an adult he inspired the envy of his fiancée for the ease with which he could doze off on an airplane.",

        "vignette": "Bernadette Kleber was a 34-year-old divorced, unemployed white mother of three school-age children. She was living with a new companion. Ms. Kleber presented to a psychiatrist for anxiety and sleepiness.\n\nMs. Kleber had experienced anxiety much of her life, but she had become much more worried and stressed since the birth of her first child 10 years before. She said she was “okay at home” but anxious in social situations. She avoided having to interact with new people, fearing that she would be embarrassed and judged. For example, she wanted to lose the weight that she had gained since the births of her children (current body mass index [BMI] 27.7) but was afraid of the ridicule that might accompany her efforts at the gym. She had gradually withdrawn from situations in which she might be forced to meet new people, and this made it almost impossible for her to interview for a new job, much less work in one. She had been successfully treated for social anxiety disorder 5 years earlier with psychotherapy, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [SSRI] antidepressant, and clonazepam 0.25 mg twice daily, but her symptoms had returned over the prior year. She denied increasing the dose of either medication or taking any other medication (prescribed or over the counter) for anxiety. Although excited about her new relationship, she was worried her new girlfriend would leave her if she did not “tune up my act.”\n\nShe denied periods of significant depression, although she said she had experienced multiple periods of feeling frustrated with her limited effectiveness. She also denied all manic symptoms.\n\nThe psychiatrist then asked Ms. Kleber about her “sleepiness.” She said she slept more than anyone she knew. She said she typically slept at least 9 hours per night but then took two naps for 5 additional hours during the day. She did not recall a problem until the end of high school, when she started falling asleep around 8:00 or 9:00 p.m. and dozing every afternoon. When she tried to go to college, she realized how much more sleep she needed than her friends and eventually dropped out because she could not stay awake in class. Despite the naps, she typically fell asleep when visiting friends or family and when reading or watching TV. She quit driving alone for fear of falling asleep at the wheel. Late afternoon naps were not restorative and had no apparent impact on her falling asleep at night.\n\nRaising a family was difficult, especially because mornings were Ms. Kleber’s worst period. For at least half an hour after waking, she was disoriented and confused, making it difficult to get her children to school. Throughout the day, she said she felt “scattered and inattentive.”\n\nSnoring had appeared 5 years earlier. Her companion was unsure whether Ms. Kleber also had breathing pauses during her sleep. Ms. Kleber denied having ever experienced sleep paralysis or abruptly falling asleep in the middle of a sentence. Although she would fall asleep while socializing, it would generally occur during a lull in the conversation while she was in a quiet spot in the corner of a couch. She denied falling down when she fell asleep. She reported experiencing hypnopompic hallucinations several times per year since she was a teenager.\n\nOn examination, Ms. Kleber was an overweight woman who was cooperative and coherent. She was concerned about her anxiety but preoccupied with her sleep problem. She denied depression, suicidality, psychosis, and memory complaints. Her insight and judgment appeared intact.\n\nHer physical examination was essentially noncontributory. Her medical history was significant only for hypercholesterolemia and occasional migraine headaches. Ms. Kleber did have some muscular complaints, such as weakness in her legs and pain in her left arm; these were related to exertion. She has smoked marijuana occasionally to help with her pain but denied that the marijuana was an important contributor to her sleepiness. She denied a history of head trauma and unusual illnesses. She denied a family history of sleep or mood problems, although multiple relatives were “anxious.”\n\nMs. Kleber was referred for sleep studies. Polysomnography showed an apnea hypopnea index of 3 events per hour. The next day, she underwent a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), which indicated a mean sleep latency of 7 minutes with one sleep-onset REM period during the testing. A lumbar puncture was done to assess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of hypocretin-1; the level appeared in the normal range.",

He had been having some trouble focusing on his work as an information technology consultant and was worried that he would lose his job. A selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant had been started 6 months earlier, resulting in some improvement of symptoms, and Mr. Linares reported that he was adherent to this medication.\n\nHe denied recent stressors. In addition to having been diagnosed with depression, he had received diagnoses of hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease. He complained of heartburn as well as erectile dysfunction, for which he had not been medically evaluated.\n\nMr. Linares was born in Venezuela. He had two grown children.

He was evaluated as an outpatient in the renal unit of a small hospital during his routine hemodialysis.\n\nMr. Meng had been diagnosed with diabetes soon after his immigration to the United States 15 years earlier. He developed progressive renal insufficiency and had begun hemodialysis 7 years earlier. He was divorced, with two adult children and three young grandchildren. He currently lived with one of his children. Before starting on dialysis, Mr. Meng had worked episodically in a local grocery store owned by friends. Prior to emigrating from China, he had enjoyed a career as a pharmacist. He spoke little English; all interviews were conducted with a Mandarin interpreter.\n\nAt the time of the evaluation, Mr. Meng said he felt “itchy, creepy, and crawly,” like “worms were crawling underneath his skin.” These symptoms had fluctuated over the past few years but had worsened in recent weeks, and he felt like he was “going crazy.” He described being worried and often tired, but noted that he always cheered up when playing with his grandchildren or when visiting with old friends from his hometown. He did not display a thought disorder. A review of the chart indicated that Mr. Meng’s physical complaints had been conceptualized at various times as akathisia, peripheral neuropathy, and “psychosomatic” and “psychotically ruminative” symptoms. He had been euthymic and off all psychiatric medications for 2 years at the time of this evaluation.\n\nMr. Meng noted that his physical symptoms were worse at night, when he tried to sit still or lie down. The discomfort was only in his legs. Rubbing them helped, but the greatest relief came from standing up and pacing. Dialysis was especially difficult because of “being strapped to a machine for hours.” He also complained of daytime sleepiness and fatigue.

One of the nurses mentioned that he often asked them to cut short his dialysis, generally looked tired, and always seemed to be “jumping around.” The staff wondered whether he might be nonadherent to his medications as well as being uncooperative at times during the dialysis.",

They were both successful attorneys in their late 30s. They had known each other since high school, had been dating for about 2 years, and planned to get married in about 6 months. Both denied ever having previously seen a therapist or received a psychiatric diagnosis.\n\nThe couples therapist met with them together for one session. Both Ms. Olsen and Mr. Nelson reported being very much in love and wanting the marriage to work out, but they also said that they were fighting much of the time. Ms. Olsen said she admired Mr. Nelson’s intelligence and steadiness and did not know why they fought. He, on the other hand, said he was still “totally infatuated” but upset about Ms. Olsen’s overall lack of interest in him. As the session neared a close, Mr. Nelson asked Ms. Olsen whether she wanted to bring up “the schedule, the alcohol, or the sex thing,” at which she smiled and said, “I’m afraid we’re out of time for today.”\n\nThe therapist met with each of them separately. At his meeting, Mr. Nelson said his biggest concern with Ms. Olsen was her lack of interest in sex. She seemed to go through the motions, he said, and always relied on alcohol. He worried that he was a “7 trying to date a 10” and that she just did not find him attractive. He was distressed about the fact that, try as he might, he was unable to bring her to orgasm or even to get her significantly aroused. This was, in turn, leading him to initiate sex less frequently, and even when he tried, he would “often just give up half-way through.” He had brought it up with her several times, but she had insisted that there was no problem. The therapist asked what he had meant by “the schedule thing.” He explained that since they had begun dating, she had limited their time together to one “school night,” usually a Tuesday, and then either a Friday or Saturday night. She had insisted that the schedule was necessary for her to complete her work and see her best girlfriends, but he had increasingly come to believe it was to avoid him.\n\nIn her individual session, Ms. Olsen said she was most frustrated by Mr. Nelson’s intensity and high desire for sex. She had set up their weekly schedule because otherwise he would want to constantly have sex with her. As it was, he wanted sex every time they got together, often twice in the same night. She readily admitted that she got drunk to tolerate intercourse. She added that she had used alcohol to numb herself since she began dating while in her teens. Until she had started dating Mr. Nelson, most of her sexual experiences had been “while drunk with strangers.” She had had a couple of boyfriends, but one was secretly gay and the other was “happy to get a blow job every now and then.” She had not told Mr. Nelson about these misadventures because she preferred that he continue to see her as “the near-virginal beauty queen.” Although alcohol made intercourse acceptable, “sexual arousal was almost never tolerable” and made her want to pass out. In recent months, Mr. Nelson had increasingly “forced the orgasm issue.” In the past, she would simply have broken up with any boyfriend who acted that way, but she believed she needed to stick it out because she was nearing 40 and this would be her “last chance to have a baby.” When asked why she thought she had these issues with sex, Ms. Olsen looked out the window for almost a minute and then answered, “I’m not going to tell you.”",

        "vignette": "Irene Rohmer, a 25-year-old salesperson, presented to a psychiatrist because of anxiety and depression. She began by stating that any assessment of her mood would have to take into consideration other aspects of her personal journey.\n\nMs. Rohmer had been born without complications, assigned male at birth, and raised as a boy. As long as she could remember, she had been teased and called a “sissy” by neighborhood boys. She had generally preferred the company of girls throughout childhood. During her teen years, she continued to have many female friends but considered herself a gay male and dated a few other gay teens. She recalled trying her best to “fit in” but noted that she had always felt like an outsider.\n\nAt age 19, during a romantic relationship with a man, she become aware of an intense desire to be a woman. That relationship ended, but Ms. Rohmer’s desire to be a woman evolved into a strong sense that she had been born as the wrong gender. She tried to figure out whether this sense had existed earlier, but all she could recall was occasionally wishing she were a girl to fit in more comfortably with her friends.\n\nBy age 20, Ms. Rohmer was very unhappy about being seen as a man. She viewed her genitalia as “repugnant” and a “mistake of nature.” Her family and some of her friends had not supported her developing sense of herself, and she recalled feeling increasingly hopeless, with episodic suicidal ideation and one nonlethal suicide attempt by overdose at age 21.\n\nBeginning at age 22, Ms. Rohmer lived as a female, including changing her name and exclusively wearing women’s clothes. She struggled to access appropriate health services and encountered multiple barriers to obtaining appropriate treatments, but, at the age of 24, Ms. Rohmer was evaluated by two psychiatrists skilled in transgender health, who agreed with her perspective, and she started gender-affirming hormone therapy.\n\nAs her transition progressed, she began to feel more comfortable in the female role and pleased with having secondary sexual characteristics that were more consistent with her experienced gender. She explored her sexuality during this time, dating both gay and straight men. Her anxiety diminished, although, as a member of a disenfranchised subgroup, she felt vulnerable to various types of aggression, including potential partner violence.\n\nThe following year, at age 25, Ms. Rohmer had the gender on her driver’s license and passport changed from male to female (a change of gender markers) and underwent gender-affirming surgeries that included vaginoplasty and breast augmentation. The results of these surgeries were satisfactory, and she was often happy with the transition. She described herself as being “more comfortable in her skin” than she had ever been, and she only infrequently felt hopeless and suicidal. Despite not feeling particularly accepted by her family of origin or by some of her old friends, she found warm support from other friends and colleagues at work. Although she has many friends who are gender nonbinary/gender nonconforming, Ms. Rohmer identifies as a heterosexual female.\n\nShe said she tended to worry that people were judging her negatively, but this worry was less intense now than it had been earlier in her transition. She denied any recent suicide attempts, depression, or self-injurious behavior. She said she had “almost” given up on having a successful relationship but was “somehow” still optimistic that something would work out.",

        "vignette": "Kyle was a 12-year-old boy who reluctantly agreed to admission to a psychiatric unit after getting arrested for breaking into a grocery store. His mother said she was “exhausted,” adding that it was hard to raise a boy who “doesn’t know the rules.”\n\nBeginning as a young child, Kyle was unusually aggressive, bullying other children and taking their things. When confronted by his mother, stepfather, or a teacher, he had long tended to curse, punch, and show no concern for possible punishment. Disruptive, impulsive, and “fidgety,” Kyle was diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and placed in a special education program by second grade. He began to see a psychiatrist in fourth grade for weekly psychotherapy and medications (quetiapine and dexmethylphenidate). He was adherent only sporadically with both the medication and the therapy. When asked why this was, he replied that his psychiatrist was “stupid.”\n\nDuring the year prior to the admission, he had been caught stealing from school lockers (a cell phone, a jacket, a laptop computer), disciplined after “mugging” a classmate for his wallet, and suspended after multiple physical fights with classmates. He had been arrested twice for these behaviors. His mother and teachers agreed that although he could be charming to strangers, people quickly caught on to the fact that he was a “con artist.” Kyle was consistently unremorseful, externalizing of blame, and uninterested in the feelings of others. He was disorganized, was inattentive and uninterested in following instructions, and constantly lost his possessions. He generally did not do his homework, and when he did, his performance was erratic. When confronted about his poor performance, he tended to say, “And what are you going to do, shoot me?” Kyle, his mother, and his teachers agreed that he was a loner and not well liked by his peers.\n\nKyle lived with his mother, stepfather, and two younger half-siblings. His stepfather was unemployed, and his mother worked part-time as a cashier in a grocery store. His biological father was in prison for drug possession. Both biological grandfathers had a history of alcohol use disorder.\n\nKyle’s early history was normal. The pregnancy was uneventful, and he reached all of his milestones on time. There was no history of sexual or physical abuse. Kyle had no known medical problems, alcohol or substance abuse, or participation in gang activities. He had not been caught with weapons, had not set fires, and had not been seen as particularly cruel to other children or animals. He had been regularly truant from school but had neither run away nor stayed away from home until late at night.\n\nWhen interviewed on the psychiatric unit, Kyle was casually groomed and appeared his stated age of 12. He was fidgety and made sporadic eye contact with the interviewer. He said he was “mad” and insisted he would rather be in jail than on a psychiatric unit. His speech was loud but coherent, goal directed, and of normal rate. His affect was irritable and angry. He denied suicidal or homicidal ideation. He denied psychotic symptoms. He denied feeling depressed. He had no obvious cognitive deficits but declined more formal testing. His insight was limited, and his judgment was poor by history.",

        "vignette": "Lucas Sandahl, a 32-year-old landscape architect, presented to a psychiatrist for help with anger. He came to the office with his wife, the mother of their two young children. The couple agreed that Mr. Sandahl had become “almost impossible to live with.” Mrs. Sandahl reported that although she had always considered her husband “high-strung,” his outbursts were increasing in both frequency and intensity, and she worried that he would become violent with her.\n\nTheir most recent argument began when Mr. Sandahl came home after a “hard day at work” to find that dinner was not ready. When he entered the kitchen and saw his wife sitting at the table reading the newspaper, he “exploded” and launched into a tirade about how “bad” a wife she was. When Mrs. Sandahl tried to explain her own long day, Mr. Sandahl cursed at her and broke glassware and a kitchen chair. Terrified, she ran out of the kitchen, gathered up the toddlers, and left for her mother’s house a few miles away. The next day, she told her husband that he would need to get help immediately or prepare for a divorce.\n\nMr. Sandahl said his “blowups” began in childhood but did not become “problematic” for him until age 13. At about that time, he started having frequent fights with classmates that would occasionally result in trips to the principal’s office. In between the altercations, he was active socially and a solid student.\n\nMr. Sandahl estimated that he had had approximately four verbal outbursts a week in recent years, generally in response to frustration, unexpected demands, or perceived insults. In addition to these heated verbal tussles, Mr. Sandahl described acts of violence about every 2 months; for example, he threw a computer monitor across the room when it started “acting up,” he kicked a hole in a wall when one of his children would not quit crying, and he destroyed his mobile phone during an argument with his mother. He denied physical fights since his adolescence, although he had nearly come to blows with a neighbor as well as an assortment of strangers and employees. The idea that he might physically hurt someone scared Mr. Sandahl “to the core.”\n\nThese outbursts blighted his relationships with colleagues and romantic partners and led to his decision to start his own landscaping company at age 25. The business had done well, despite his demanding style and “hair-trigger” temper that led to high employee turnover.\n\nMr. Sandahl described the episodes as short-lived, reaching a peak within seconds and rarely lasting more than a few minutes. Between episodes, he described himself as feeling “fine.” He had experienced brief periods of depressed mood and increased anxiety, but these had not impaired him significantly and tended to resolve on their own within a week. Mr. Sandahl drank socially, but neither he nor his wife linked the outbursts to the alcohol. He had a history of experimentation with various drugs of abuse, but not in recent years.\n\nMr. Sandahl reported at least two other immediate family members with significant “anger issues.” His father was emotionally abusive and perfectionistic, expecting “great things” from his only son. Mr. Sandahl’s older sister also had problems with her temper; he attributed her three divorces to her emotionally abusive behavior.\n\nOn examination, Mr. Sandahl was casually dressed, cooperative, and coherent. He was worried about his behavior and contrite toward his wife. He denied depression, psychosis, and confusion. He denied any thoughts of hurting himself or others. He was cognitively intact. His insight and judgment were good during the course of the interview.",

Mr. Tucker denied having had a drink since making the appointment 3 days earlier.\n\nFor 20 years after high school, Mr. Tucker typically drank 3–5 beers per evening, five times per week. Over the last 7 years, he had consumed alcohol almost daily, with an average of 6 beers on weeknights and 12 beers on weekends and holidays. His wife repeatedly voiced her concern that he was “drinking too much,” but despite his efforts to limit his alcohol intake, Mr. Tucker continued to spend much of the weekend drinking, sometimes missing family get-togethers, and often passed out while watching TV in the evening. He remained productive at work, however, and never called in sick. In many ways, his history represented what is typically seen in alcohol use disorder. Mr. Tucker had achieved two 30-day periods of abstinence in the previous 4 years. Both times, he said he had quit drinking “cold turkey” in response to his wife’s concerns. He denied having had symptoms of alcohol withdrawal either time.\n\nIn the 6 months prior to the evaluation, Mr. Tucker had become uncharacteristically irritable, fatigued, dysphoric, and worried. He was unable to enjoy his usual activities, including food and sex, and had difficulty concentrating. He also reacted more emotionally to stresses and expressed unsubstantiated concern about the future of his business. The patient often awoke at 2:00 a.m. and had trouble getting back to sleep.\n\nMr. Tucker and his wife indicated that although this period of sadness had lasted 6 months, he had experienced several similar episodes in the prior 5 years, lasting 4–6 weeks each. They denied any such episodes earlier in his life.\n\nMr. Tucker had been married for 18 years, and he and his wife had one 17-year-old daughter. The patient was a high school graduate with 2 years of community college who currently owned a successful plumbing company. He denied any other history of psychiatric or medical problems, as well as any history of mania or suicide attempts. He had never seen a psychiatrist before.\n\nAt a recent annual checkup, Mr. Tucker’s internist noted a mildly elevated blood pressure (135/92), a γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) value of 47 IU/L, and a mean corpuscular volume of 92.5 μm3. All other laboratory results were in the normal range.\n\nAt the time of his first visit, Mr. Tucker was neatly dressed, maintained good eye contact, and showed no evidence of confusion or psychotic symptoms. His eyes teared up when he talked about the future, and he admitted to having felt sad for most of the day on a regular basis for the last 6 months, but he denied suicidal ideation or plans. His cognition was within normal limits, and he demonstrated an understanding of the effects that the alcohol was having on him.\n\nA physical examination by the psychiatrist revealed a normal pulse rate, no tremor or sweating, and only a slightly elevated blood pressure.",

For many years, Mr. Underwood had drunk alcohol only after work, but about a year prior to the evaluation he had begun to routinely drink in the morning whenever he had the day off. More recently, he had begun to feel “shaky” every morning and would sometimes treat that sensation with a drink, followed by more alcohol during the day.\n\nMr. Underwood experienced a number of problems related to drinking. His wife was “at the end of her rope” and considering divorce. His diminished ability to concentrate at work was “sinking” his once-promising career. He was spending more time trying to recover from the effects of drinking and found himself planning strategies both for abstinence and for surreptitiously taking his next drink.\n\nMr. Underwood first tried alcohol in high school and said that he had always been able to hold his liquor more than his friends could. In college, he was one of the heaviest drinkers in a fraternity known as “Animal House” around campus. Through his 30s, he gradually increased the frequency of his drinking from primarily on weekends to daily. Over the prior year, he had switched from being exclusively a beer drinker to drinking vodka. He had gone to many Alcoholics Anonymous meetings over the years but tended to drink as soon as the meeting ended. He had received no formal treatment.\n\nThe patient denied recent use of other substances; he had smoked marijuana and snorted cocaine several times during college but never since. He had used no other illicit drugs and took no medications. He did not smoke cigarettes. He had experienced blackouts on several occasions during college but not since then. He had no history of seizures and no other medical problems. Family history was significant for alcohol use disorder in his father and paternal grandfather.\n\nMr. Underwood entered the alcohol treatment program at approximately 3:00 p.m., having not had a drink since the evening before. He was diaphoretic and exhibited significant tremulousness in his hands. He complained of anxiety, restlessness, irritability, nausea, and recent insomnia.\n\nClinical evaluation revealed a casually groomed, diaphoretic man who was cooperative but anxiously pacing and who immediately said, “I’m getting ready to jump out of my skin.” Speech was of normal rate, rhythm, and tone. He denied depression. There was no evidence of psychotic thinking, and he denied auditory, visual, or tactile hallucinations. He was alert and oriented to person, place, and date. He had no gross memory deficits, but his attention and concentration were noted to be reduced.\n\nNotable features of his physical examination were marked diaphoresis, a blood pressure of 155/95, a heart rate of 104 beats/minute, severe tremulousness in his upper extremities, and hyperactive deep tendon reflexes throughout. Laboratory test findings were within normal limits except for aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, which were approximately 3 times normal.",

He had always been “on top of things.” At age 35, he was independently wealthy as the owner of several clothing franchises, lived with an ex-partner in a more-than-comfortable apartment in New York City, worked out every day, enjoyed the company of a group of loving friends, and, although single, had not given up on the idea of someday (preferably soon) finding the perfect man to share his life with. Mr. Vincent came out to his Irish Catholic family when he was 19. His parents had already guessed that Mr. Vincent was gay long before he told them, and they took the non-news fairly well. Their main concern had been that their son might be discriminated against because of his sexuality, get hurt, and live a lonely life. Nothing could be farther from the way things turned out: Mr. Vincent was “out and proud” and living it up.\n\nWhen Mr. Vincent found himself with a substance use problem, he addressed it the same way he had dealt with pretty much everything else: head on. For the first time in his life, he decided to see a psychiatrist.\n\nMr. Vincent described a pattern that revolved around weekend “party and play” activities. On Friday and Saturday evenings—and occasionally during the week—he would go out to dinner with friends and then to a club or a private party. He tended to drink two or three cocktails and four to five glasses of wine during the evening. Without the alcohol, he found he could easily say “no” to substances, but “after a good buzz, if someone has coke—and there is always someone around who has coke—I use. And then my heart starts to race, and then I do everything I can to hook up. I used to go online, but these days, it’s all on Scruff and good ol’ Grindr.”\n\nParty and play are classic code words for drugs and sex, respectively. The term is sometimes abbreviated PNP.\n\nScruff and Grindr are smartphone applications that use GPS to identify and connect similarly inclined individuals in a person’s geographical vicinity.\n\nOverall, Mr. Vincent drank alcohol and used cocaine three to four times a week and “occasionally used Tina and bath salts.” He could hardly attend Monday morning meetings, much less prepare for them, and had been trying to cut down on his cocaine use for the prior 6 months without success.\n\nTina is slang for crystal methamphetamine (i.e., from crystal to Christina to Tina). Bath salts is slang for a powder that contains a variety of synthetic stimulants (e.g., cathinone derivatives).\n\nSince Mr. Vincent had started using cocaine regularly, he had lost weight and had trouble sleeping. He worried that his effort at the gym was going to waste. His business continued to succeed, but his own effectiveness had decreased. Most importantly, he did not practice safer sex when high on stimulants, and because he did not want to be on a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) regimen, he worried about HIV seroconversion.",

His mother gave him several tablets of hydrocodone-acetaminophen that she had for back pain, and he found this helpful. When he ran out of the pills and his pain persisted, he went to the emergency room. He was told he had a mild sprain. He was given a 1-month supply of hydrocodone-acetaminophen. He took the pills as prescribed for 1 month, and his pain resolved.\n\nAfter stopping the pills, however, Mr. Winters began to experience a recurrence of the pain in his knee. He saw an orthopedist, who ordered imaging studies and determined that there was no structural damage. Mr. Winters was given another 1-month supply of hydrocodone-acetaminophen. This time, however, he needed to take more than prescribed in order to ease the pain. He also felt dysphoric and “achy” when he abstained from taking the medication, and described a “craving” for more opioids. He returned to the orthopedist, who referred him to a pain specialist.\n\nMr. Winters was too embarrassed to go to the pain specialist, believing that his faith and strength should help him overcome the pain. He found it impossible to live without the pain medication, however, because of the pain, dysphoria, and muscle aches when he stopped the medication. He also began to “enjoy the high” and experienced intense craving. He began to frequent emergency rooms to receive more opioids, often lying about the timing and nature of his right knee pain, and even stole pills from his mother on two occasions. He became preoccupied with trying to find more opioids, and his work and home life suffered. He endorsed low mood, especially when contemplating the impact of opioids on his life, but denied any other mood or neurovegetative symptoms. Eventually, he told his primary care doctor about his opioid use and low mood, and that doctor referred him to the outpatient psychiatry clinic.\n\nMr. Winters had a history of two lifetime major depressive episodes that were treated successfully with escitalopram by his primary care doctor. He also had a history of an alcohol use disorder when he was in his 20s. He managed to quit using alcohol on his own after a family intervention. He smoked two packs of cigarettes daily. His father suffered from depression, and “almost everyone” on his mother’s side of the family had “issues with addiction.” He had been married to his wife for 20 years, and they had two school-age children. He had been a minister in his church for 15 years. Results of a recent physical examination and laboratory testing performed by his primary care physician had been within normal limits.\n\nOn mental status examination, Mr. Winters was cooperative and did not exhibit any psychomotor abnormalities. He answered most questions briefly, often simply saying “yes” or “no.” Speech was of a normal rate and tone, without tangentiality or circumstantiality. He reported that his mood was “lousy,” and his affect was dysphoric and constricted. He denied symptoms of paranoia or hallucinations. He denied any thoughts of harming himself or others.

At the time of the appointment, he had been without a permanent home for over 6 months. He had lived in various places, including his car and friends’ homes. For over 1 month prior to presentation, he had been living in a tent in the woods. He had called his parents on his recent birthday, and they had offered to pay for substance use disorder treatment as long as they could pay directly.\n\nMr. Xavier reported that his problem started at age 24, when he had a new wife and young child and had taken on two jobs to make ends meet (working in a factory and as a local delivery driver). When he injured his back and could not get to work because of the pain, a friend offered him a few tablets of acetaminophen-oxycodone (Percocet). Not only did his pain disappear, but his energy and mood improved. For the first time in his life, he felt “normal and happy.”\n\nMr. Xavier continued to use one to four Percocet tablets per day for 1½ years. He never took more than one pill at a time. Then, at age 26, he snorted half a bag of heroin (about $5 on the street). “It took about 10 minutes, but I was transported into an indescribable euphoria. Like taking that first Percocet times 10. . . . You chase that first feeling for the rest of your life. It never repeats.” Within months of starting heroin, he began using it intravenously in an effort to glimpse the euphoria again.\n\nAfter that first experience with heroin, the progression of use was rapid. Within 6 months, Mr. Xavier was unemployed, separated from his family, and homeless. “I was sleeping in my car or on the streets . . . using up to 30 bags [$300] daily.”\n\nMr. Xavier began to reach out for help. He enrolled in outpatient rehabilitation for opioid users. The cravings to use, even while in treatment, were intense. Mr. Xavier reported multiple relapses. He added cocaine to the heroin injections, and “speedballs” became Mr. Xavier’s drug of choice for a while, but he then returned to using only heroin. The first of multiple accidental overdoses occurred in a vacant house when he was 27. He had been admitted to “about 10 detoxes and rehabs” but would typically relapse within hours or weeks of discharge. He had also gone sporadically to Narcotics Anonymous meetings for years.\n\nTo acquire money for his habit, he broke into homes, stole from relatives, and wrote bad checks. “Every penny went to drugs. I’m lucky not to be in prison, but not so lucky in that everybody hates me.”\n\nHe decided to move to Martha’s Vineyard a year prior to the consultation because it “sounded like a quiet place.” He brought some methadone with him, but the eventual withdrawal was “fierce.”\n\nHe continued to use heroin and oxycodone when he could easily get them. Otherwise, he drank alcohol heavily, although he said, “I need to stop drinking—that’s what really gets me in trouble.” He also took diazepam (Valium) sporadically; however, he did not consider that to be a problem but more of a way to get through the day.\n\nHe worked occasionally as a landscaper. His boss—someone he had met at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting—had made it clear that he would call when there was extra work to be done, but that until Mr. Xavier got clean, the boss would not actually expect him to show up. He had held a variety of other odd jobs, including office supplies salesman, veterinary assistant, and gas station attendant. He had not seen his daughter in over 2 years.\n\nOn examination, Mr. Xavier appeared somewhat unkempt. He was generally cooperative but appeared restless, and at one point he urgently left the room; when he returned, he reported that he was experiencing bouts of diarrhea. His pupils were enlarged and his skin was remarkable for sweating and piloerection. He yawned several times and appeared irritable and unhappy. His arms and legs frequently twitched. He repeatedly blew his nose and appeared tearful. His speech was rapid, and he appeared impatient. He denied psychotic symptoms, suicidality, and homicidality. He said he was hopeful that if he could get some Suboxone (buprenorphine and naloxone), he might be able to keep a job and maybe get to be a real father.\n\nLaboratory studies were negative for HIV and hepatitis A, B, and C.",

This was his first psychiatric evaluation. He reported no past psychiatric history.\n\nMr. Yates traced his increased stress to a death in his city 4 months earlier. The death was recorded on video and featured an unarmed Black man being murdered by two white off-duty policemen who had accused him of theft. Like many people, Mr. Yates first saw the video via his social media “timeline,” where it was routinely reposted by his friends. Because the murder had occurred in his hometown, it received much local attention.\n\nMr. Yates’s social media timeline began to fill up with other examples of police brutality toward Black men. He said he watched the videos because they were “trending” and appeared on his social media timeline abruptly, unfiltered, and without warning. In addition, he became increasingly aware of news programming, social media posts, and community memorials relating to the deaths and abuse of other Black men. Although he described trying to avoid details about these tragedies, he said that news, images, and videos were unavoidable, and he had become increasingly preoccupied with fears for the safety of his wife, his young sons, his extended family, and himself.\n\nMr. Yates reported that under normal circumstances, he “didn’t like to talk about this stuff,” but his wife had insisted that he get treatment because she was concerned that he “didn’t seem himself.” Mr. Yates wanted the evaluating psychiatrist to understand that he was not paranoid or overly sensitive about racism, and that up until recently, he’d been good about “compartmentalizing.” Nevertheless, he admitted that it had become difficult to stop thinking about violence against unarmed Black men. He had recently disabled his social media accounts in a proactive effort to minimize his exposure to images and commentary regarding the incidents. In addition to stopping use of social media, he reported avoidance of newspapers, the internet, and television.\n\nMr. Yates noted that he had also become edgy, nervous, and always on guard against attack. He had gradually reduced his explorations around the city, preferring to stay close to home. Although he had previously jogged every morning before work, he quit jogging in the local community park because he “didn’t want any trouble.” Mr. Yates reported his sleep over the past 3 months as being interrupted by vivid, disturbing dreams of being chased by police officers.\n\nFor Mr. Yates, evenings were particularly stressful, and he had recently increased his use of alcohol and cannabis to “unwind” at the end of the day. He also had begun to drink a six-pack, or more, of beer after dinner, often “passing out” in the family den. The alcohol helped him to relax, and smoking “a blunt” of marijuana before bedtime improved his sleep and reduced nightmares. He stated that the biggest problem with the cannabis was his wife’s complaining that their young children might see him using it or that his use might be detected in a random urine toxicology screen at work. Mr. Yates had been increasingly late to work but had not mentioned to his wife that he had twice been reprimanded by his supervisor for the lateness.\n\nMr. Yates reported first using both cannabis and alcohol at fraternity parties when he was about 19 years old. Throughout college, he smoked small amounts of marijuana once or twice weekly and rarely drank more than two beers at a time. In the decade since his college graduation, he had smoked marijuana only occasionally and tended to have no more than 1 or 2 beers on the weekend. He had never smoked tobacco or used other substances. His use of alcohol and cannabis had not increased until 3 months prior to the evaluation, after he started seeing the videos.\n\nMr. Yates denied experiencing feelings of worthlessness, guilt, or hopelessness. He reported no prior history of panic attacks, mania, psychosis, or obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and he had never received psychiatric hospitalization or outpatient treatment. He denied suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, or previous history of suicidality. There was no family psychiatric history aside from his father, who developed posttraumatic stress disorder following military service in Vietnam.",

He denied having any prior history of a psychiatric or substance use disorder. He was appropriately dressed and groomed, expressed himself fluently in both English and Spanish, spoke in normal tone and volume, and on examination presented with intact cognitive function and average intelligence.\n\nMr. Zambrano had been betting on sports and playing cards since childhood, noting in the evaluation that gambling “is part of our culture.” His own father’s favorite hobby and stress reliever had been to play poker with friends at night, and Mr. Zambrano remembered with affection the father-son camaraderie they shared on these occasions. Poker became for him a familial activity that he increasingly used to relieve work-related stress. He relished the excitement as well as the intellectual challenge and competition.\n\nCard games did not, however, remain a benign pastime for Mr. Zambrano. He had begun to lose more money than he could afford. Over the 2 years prior to his presentation for treatment, he had gradually increased the frequency and stakes of his poker nights. When he lost, he tended to place even larger bets, convinced that the odds would favor him the following time. When he won, he felt great and would continue to play, convinced he was “on a streak.” Although losses made him feel unworthy, stupid, and irritable, he believed success would come if he could fine-tune his strategy. He felt a powerful, almost constant impulse to increase the tempo of his gambling and recover the money he had lost. When he tried to cut back on gambling, he felt irritable and preoccupied, and quickly returned to his poker nights.\n\nBy the time Mr. Zambrano presented to the gambling clinic, he felt desperate. Nightly poker had led to daytime fatigue and poor performance at his coaching job, which he had previously loved. He was consumed with thoughts about his next poker game. His wife and son had long resented his time away from the family, but his wife had just found out that he had used up his son’s college fund plus accumulated $30,000 in credit card debt. When his wife threatened to file for divorce, he felt sad and depressed and decided to seek treatment.",

It was late in the evening, and no one from the admitting team was available, but a social work note in the chart indicated that the patient’s fracture appeared to have been the result of his tripping in his messy apartment. The note also stated that the patient had no children or known living family.\n\nThe neighbor who had brought Mr. Alvarez to the hospital had stated that the patient had been more reclusive in recent years and that his self-care had worsened after his wife’s death 6 months earlier. Up until the day of the surgery, however, he had been able to function independently in his apartment. The neighbor, a nurse, also mentioned that while they were waiting for the ambulance, her husband had sat with Mr. Alvarez while she searched the apartment for pill bottles. She said she had found only an unopened bottle of acetaminophen and a dusty bottle of a medication used for hypertension.\n\nRoutine admission laboratory results indicated that Mr. Alvarez had an elevated blood urea nitrogen level, a low albumin level, and a high normal mean corpuscular volume. His blood pressure was 160/110. In addition to medications related to the surgery, the chart indicated that he had received haloperidol 2 mg after a bout of agitation. A nursing note 1 hour after the haloperidol administration indicated that the patient was “worried and stiff.”\n\nOn mental status examination, Mr. Alvarez was lying at a 45-degree angle in his unkempt bed. He appeared thin and had moderate temporal wasting. His affect was sad, worried, and constricted. He appeared stiff and uncomfortable. He did not immediately respond to the interviewer’s questions and comments. His eyes remained generally shut, but they did flicker open a few times, and his body habitus implied that he was awake. After multiple efforts, the psychiatrist was able to get the patient to say “I’m fine” and “Get out.” When asked where he was, Mr. Alvarez said, “My apartment.” When he did open his eyes, the patient appeared confused. He did not respond to other questions and declined to do a clock drawing test. The surgery team had called in a one-to-one companion earlier in the day, and she said that the patient was generally either asleep or trying to get out of bed and that he had not been making any sense all day.",

His wife reported that Mr. Cullman had begun to change at age 68, about a year after his retirement. He had gradually stopped playing golf and cards, activities he had enjoyed “for decades.” He had explained that seeing his friends was no longer “fun,” and he generally refused to socialize. Instead, he sat on the couch all day, worrying about finances and the future. He denied sadness, however, and any suicidal or homicidal ideation. His wife said he was sleeping 10–12 hours a day instead of his customary 7 hours and that he had, uncharacteristically, gained 8 pounds in less than 1 year.\n\nHis wife had become worried that retirement had left Mr. Cullman depressed, and she had mentioned her concerns to their primary care physician. Their physician agreed and prescribed sertraline (titrated to 100 mg/day for 8 months) and then sustained-release venlafaxine (titrated to 150 mg twice daily and maintained at that level for over 1 year). Mr. Cullman’s symptoms gradually worsened during these medication trials, and the internist ultimately referred him for a psychiatric evaluation.\n\nMr. Cullman’s past psychiatric history was notable for an episode in his 20s when he had difficulty at work, felt apathetic and unconnected, and had difficulty concentrating. These symptoms persisted for several months and resolved without treatment as his work situation improved.\n\nMr. Cullman’s family history was positive for a single major depressive episode in one of his two younger brothers; the depression responded well to psychotherapy and an antidepressant medication. His mother had developed dementia in her 70s.\n\nMr. Cullman’s personal history revealed unremarkable development and childhood, graduation from college with a degree in business, a successful career as a corporate manager, and retirement at age 67. He and his wife had been married for 45 years, denied significant discord, and had three children and four grandchildren who were in good health. Premorbidly, he had been outgoing, energetic, and well organized.\n\nMr. Cullman’s medical history was notable for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He was taking lisinopril, metformin, simvastatin, and venlafaxine.\n\nMental status examination revealed an alert, cooperative man who was neatly dressed and who had a steady but slow gait and no abnormal movements other than psychomotor slowing. Mr. Cullman’s speech was soft in volume but normal in rate and rhythm, without paraphasic errors. He had a limited range of emotional expression, denied feeling sad or guilty, but felt he had retired too early. He denied self-blame, hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts or plans. He was aware that his wife was concerned and acknowledged that he was less energetic and active than in the past. He ascribed these changes to his retirement. He said he was generally satisfied with his life.\n\nOn cognitive examination, Mr. Cullman was oriented except for the date. He remembered one of three objects in 2 minutes, performed three of five serial 7 subtractions correctly, named four common objects correctly, and repeated a complex sentence accurately. He was able to draw the face of a clock and place the numbers correctly but was not able to correctly place the hands at 10 minutes after 2. His blood pressure was 142/82, and his pulse was 84 and regular. His physical examination was noncontributory. His neurological examination revealed intact cranial nerves and 1+ symmetric deep tendon reflexes.",

She had reduced her social interactions, stopped going to her senior citizens center, and dropped out of her weekly card game because she experienced no pleasure and could not adequately concentrate. She had lost 7 pounds in the prior 2 months, and her sleep was interrupted by periods of insomnia with agonizing ruminations. This was the first time she had experienced any psychiatric symptoms.\n\nMs. Druker had retired 10 years earlier after a successful career as an attorney. She had been divorced for 30 years. Her two children and three grandchildren lived nearby, and she had been seeing them often before this episode.\n\nMs. Drucker had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of coronary occlusion for which she had received a stent.

        "vignette": "Carl Estel, a 74-year-old right-handed married man, was brought for a neuropsychiatric evaluation after a multi-year decline marked by stiffness, forgetfulness, and apathy. His wife had been trying to get him in for an evaluation for years and had finally become desperate enough to enlist his brothers to bring him for the evaluation.\n\nMrs. Estel described her husband’s problems as starting when he retired from his job as a plumbing contractor at age 65. He had seemed “out of sorts” almost immediately, and she had wondered at the time whether he was getting depressed. He became uncharacteristically forgetful, misplacing items and neglecting to pay bills. He had trouble with appointments, medications, and calculations. He had refused to see a physician until he was involved in a traffic accident a few years prior to this evaluation. At that time, a physician had found no significant physical injuries but had said that the accident was caused by inattention and diminished depth perception; she had recommended that Mr. Estel stop driving, and suggested that he get a more thorough evaluation for early dementia.\n\nOver the past year, things had gotten worse. Mr. Estel often could not recall the outcome of sporting events that he had just watched on television, although his memory improved with cues. He resisted activities such as travel and socializing that he had previously enjoyed. A former athlete, he stopped taking walks around the neighborhood after several falls. He quit playing cards with neighbors because the rules had become confusing. He looked depressed and acted apathetic but generally said he was fine. His judgment and problem-solving skills appeared to have significantly declined. Despite having completed 4 years of college and worked for many years as a successful professional plumber, Mr. Estel was now periodically unable to operate household appliances.\n\nAll of these cognitive problems seemed to fluctuate, so that his wife reported that sometimes he was “almost like his old self,” whereas at other times it was “like living with a zombie, a depressed zombie.” She also described his frequent exhaustion, daytime drowsiness, and staring spells.\n\nWhen asked specifically about her husband’s sleep, Mrs. Estel reported that in fact neither of them slept well. Mainly, she said, it was because of her husband “acting out his dreams.” During these episodes, which occurred several times a month, he would punch and scream, and would occasionally fall out of bed. After sustaining bruises as a result of several of the episodes, Mrs. Estel decided it would be safer to sleep on the couch. She recalled that these sleep episodes began just before her husband retired; she had wondered at the time whether he had posttraumatic stress disorder, but she did not think he had suffered any particular trauma. A few years earlier, a friend had offered her a “sleeping pill” that had helped her own husband with dementia. Mr. Estel had responded to the unknown medication with extreme rigidity and confusion, and his wife had nearly taken him to the emergency room in the middle of the night.\n\nMrs. Estel denied that her husband had ever had any psychiatric illness. When asked about psychotic symptoms, she said that perhaps every week or so, he swatted at invisible things in the air. She did not think he heard voices or felt suspicious.\n\nMr. Estel’s medical history was notable for hypercholesterolemia, cardiovascular disease with a history of stent placement, and possible transient ischemic attacks. His family history was positive for his mother having developed dementia in her mid-70s.\n\nOn examination, Mr. Estel was a stooped, stiff man who shuffled into the office. While listening to his wife present the history, he stared into space, seeming to pay no attention to the content of the conversation. His right hand was tremulous. He appeared depressed, but when asked, he said he felt fine. His voice was so quiet that words were often unintelligible even when the interviewer leaned close. He drooled at times and did not notice until his wife wiped his chin.\n\nWhen asked to participate in cognitive testing, he shrugged his shoulders and said, “I don’t know.”",

        "vignette": "Part 1:\n\nDorothy Franklin, a 54-year-old married former waitress, was brought into the psychiatric emergency room (ER) by her husband for escalating delusions and visual hallucinations. Her husband reported that she had been episodically agitated for about 10 years, uncharacteristically suspicious for about 6 months, and complaining of daily hallucinations for weeks to months. The patient referred to her experience as “my nightmare.” In a terrified voice, she explained, “I see a judge standing in front of me. Plain as day. He is a good judge, but he threatens to kill me, and I can’t stop him. I can’t believe no one else can see him. Can you help?”\n\nMr. Franklin reports that his wife had been “completely fine” until about a decade earlier, when she was in her early 40s. At that point, he reports that she had become frequently agitated, paranoid, worried, and occasionally aggressive. He had brought her to psychiatrists and internists, and she had received several diagnoses, including late-onset schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, paranoid personality, and anxiety. She and her husband could not recall the names of all of the many psychiatric medications that she had been prescribed over the years, but they included antidepressant, antipsychotic, antianxiety, and mood-stabilizing medications.\n\nMs. Franklin had smoked half a pack of cigarettes a day for many years but only rarely drank alcohol and never used recreational drugs. She had worked as a waitress for 20 years but quit 10 years prior to the evaluation because of too many “dropped trays,” misremembered customer orders, and uncharacteristic irritability. Around that time, she was arrested for “hitting someone” in a shopping mall, and she and her husband decided she needed to reduce her stress level.\n\nThe patient had two healthy adult children in their late 20s. She had one sister with “depression and irritability.” The patient’s mother had passed away 10 years earlier at age 70. She had been wheelchair bound for years because of severe dementia, postural instability, and involuntary movements. The patient’s maternal grandfather “got sick” in his late 50s and completed suicide with a firearm at age 62.\n\nOn mental status examination in the ER, Ms. Franklin was frightened but cooperative. She appeared her stated age, with thin body habitus and good grooming and hygiene. She sat next to her husband, holding his hand and often looking to him when asked questions. She had moderate psychomotor slowing, and noticeable involuntary “dancelike” movements of her trunk and upper extremities. Her eye contact was intermittent but intense. Ms. Franklin described her mood as “not well at all,” and her affect was blunted and minimally reactive. Her speech was soft and slowed, with minimal spontaneity. Her thought process was linear but slowed. She was preoccupied by paranoid delusions and visual hallucinations. She reported actively hallucinating during the interview. She denied suicidal and homicidal thoughts or plans. On cognitive examination, she was alert and oriented to person, place, and time. She had good attention and concentration, although she had significant impairments in both short- and long-term memory. Her performance on the Mini-Mental State Examination and clock drawing test revealed moderate impairment in planning and visuospatial tasks.\n\nIn the ER, results from extensive laboratory testing were normal. The patient was admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit for safety and for further workup of her psychotic symptoms.\n\nPart 2:\n\nAfter Ms. Franklin was admitted to the psychiatric unit, she received brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to rule out mass lesions (e.g., tumor or stroke) and demyelinating processes (e.g., multiple sclerosis). MRI findings were normal, and the neurology department was consulted for diagnostic assistance and administration of EEG to evaluate for a possible seizure disorder. While she was actively hallucinating, Ms. Franklin’s electroencephalogram was negative for seizure activity.\n\nGiven the nature and time course of Ms. Franklin’s symptoms, coupled with her family history of dementia and delayed-onset psychiatric disturbances, the psychiatry and neurology teams became concerned about the possibility of Huntington’s disease. After extensive discussion with the patient and her spouse, she agreed to undergo genetic testing for Huntington’s disease, and the test result was positive for 44 trinucleotide (CAG) repeats. After further psychosocial and medication management, she and her husband were referred to a comprehensive outpatient Huntington’s disease clinic.",

        "vignette": "Only upon the repeated and fervent insistence of her parents did 19-year-old Emily reluctantly agree to see a psychiatrist. “It’s not me you want to see,” Emily proclaimed emphatically. “It’s my insane parents who need your help.” Emily did not offer a chief complaint, aside from the concern that her parents were driving her “crazy.” She added, “Everything is going great in my life. I have plenty of friends, go out almost every night, and always have lots of fun.”\n\nWhile Emily was taking some time away from “the so-called real world,” her sister was attending Duke University, her younger brother was excelling at a competitive private high school, and both her parents seemed to enjoy their careers as radiologists. She asked, “Don’t you think that’s enough strivers for one family?”\n\nEmily agreed to have her parents join the session, and they told a different story. They tearfully disclosed that their daughter had become irritable, unproductive, and oppositional. She drank to intoxication almost every night, often not returning home for an entire weekend. In searching her room, they had found small amounts of marijuana, alprazolam (Xanax), cocaine, and prescription stimulants. The parents described the changes in Emily’s personality as “an adolescent nightmare” and described her friends as “losers who do nothing but dye their hair, get tattoos, and hate everything.” Emily’s attitudes and behavior contrasted markedly with those of her parents and siblings. “We don’t mind that she is doing her own thing and that she isn’t conservative like the rest of us,” her father said, “but it’s like we don’t even recognize who she’s become.”\n\nAccording to her parents, Emily’s “adolescent nightmare” began 4 years earlier. She had apparently been a studious 15-year-old girl with a lively sense of humor and a wide circle of “terrific friends.” “Almost overnight,” she began to shun her longtime friends in favor of “dropouts and malcontents” and began to accumulate traffic tickets and school detentions. Instead of her former bright-eyed curiosity, Emily manifested a lack of interest in all her academic subjects, and her grades dropped from As to Ds. The parents were at an absolute loss to explain the sudden and dramatic change.\n\nThe abrupt change in performance led the psychiatrist to ask Emily to take a battery of neuropsychological tests so the results could be compared with those of tests that she had taken when she had applied to a private high school several years earlier. In particular, Emily retook two high school admissions tests: the System for Assessment and Group Evaluation (SAGE), which measures a broad array of academic and perceptual aptitudes, and the Differential Aptitude Tests (DAT), which focus on reasoning, spelling, and perceptual skills.\n\nOn the SAGE, her average percentile scores dropped from the upper 10% for a 13-year-old to the bottom 10% for an adult (and the bottom 20% for a 13-year-old). When Emily took the DAT at age 13, she scored in the highest range for ninth graders across almost all measures. Her worst result had been in spelling, where she scored at the second-highest level. Upon repeating the test at age 19, she scored below the high school average in all measures.\n\nEEG, brain CT, and T2-weighted brain MRI scans showed no evidence of structural brain damage. However, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) T2-weighted MRI displayed a clear lesion in the left frontal cortex, highly suggestive of previous injury to that region.\n\nUpon further questioning about the crucial period in which she seemed to have changed, Emily admitted to being in a traffic accident with her now ex-boyfriend, Mark. Although Emily did not recall much from this episode, she remembered that she hit her head and that she had bad headaches for many weeks thereafter. Because Emily was not bleeding and there was no damage to the car, neither Mark nor Emily reported the incident to anyone. With Emily’s permission, the psychiatrist contacted Mark, who was away at college but a willing and excellent historian. He remembered the incident well. “Emily hit her head very, very hard on the dashboard of my car. She was not totally unconscious but very dazed. For about 3 hours, she spoke very slowly, complained that her head hurt badly, and was confused. For about 2 hours she didn’t know where she was or what day it was. She also threw up twice. I was really scared, but Emily didn’t want me to worry her parents since they’re so overprotective. And then she broke up with me, and we’ve hardly spoken since.”",

        "vignette": "Frazier Archer was a 34-year-old single white man who called a mood and personality disorders research program because an ex-friend had once said he was “borderline,” and Mr. Archer wanted to learn more about his personality.\n\nDuring his diagnostic research interview, Mr. Archer was initially reluctant to share personal information, citing a concern that his words would be misunderstood, misconstrued, or used against him. When asked about his relationships, he described regular, almost daily situations in which he was sure he was being lied to or deceived. He was particularly wary of people in leadership positions and people who had studied psychology and, therefore, had “training to understand the human mind,” which they used to manipulate people. Unlike those around him, Mr. Archer believed he did not “drink the Kool-Aid” and was able to detect manipulation and deceit.\n\nMr. Archer was employed as an assistant manager for a grocery store chain. He was extremely detail oriented at work, and had trouble delegating and completing tasks. He noted that his coworkers consistently failed to complete tasks the way that he would like. This led him to work routinely long hours “fixing their mistakes.” Numerous employers and colleagues had told him that he focused excessively on rules, lists, and small details, and that he needed to be more friendly. He described having held numerous jobs over the years, but he was quick to add, “I’ve quit as often as I’ve been fired.”\n\nDuring the interview, he emphasized that unlike many people, he understood the value of quality over productivity. He believed that his “high standards” had contributed to his “bad temper” and emotional “ups and downs.” He socialized only “superficially” with a handful of acquaintances and could recall the exact moments when previous “so-called friends and lovers” had betrayed him. He spent most of his time alone.\n\nMr. Archer denied any significant history of trauma, any current or past problems with substance use, and any history of head trauma or loss of consciousness. He also denied any history of mental health diagnosis or treatment, but he did feel he might have a mental health condition that had not yet been diagnosed. He described some social anxiety and difficulties with academic achievement in childhood, which he attributed to his own high standards and “unreliable” childhood friends.\n\nOn mental status examination, Mr. Archer appeared well groomed, cooperative, and oriented. His speech varied; at times he would pause thoughtfully prior to answering questions and provide very slow, deliberate responses. At other points in the interview he became angry and offered lengthy and digressive responses. However, he seemed generally coherent and did not evidence any perceptual disturbances. His affect was occasionally inappropriate (e.g., smiling while crying) and generally constricted. He reported apathy as to whether he lived or died but did not report any active suicidal ideation or homicidal ideation.\n\nNotably, Mr. Archer became irritated and argumentative with research staff when he was told that although he could receive verbal feedback on his interviews, he could not receive a copy of the completed questionnaires and diagnostic tools. He commented that he would document in his personal records that research staff were refusing him the forms.",

        "vignette": "Grzegorz Buchalski was an 87-year-old white man who was brought to the psychiatric emergency room (ER) by paramedics after they had been called to his apartment by neighbors when they noticed an odd smell. Apparently, his 90-year-old sister had died some days earlier after a lengthy illness. Mr. Buchalski had delayed reporting her death for several reasons. He had become increasingly disorganized as his sister’s health had worsened, and he was worried that his landlord would use the apartment’s condition as a pretext for eviction. He had tried to clean up, but his attempts consisted mainly of moving items from one place to another. He said he was about to call for help when the police and paramedics showed up.\n\nIn the ER, Mr. Buchalski recognized that his actions were odd and that he should have called for help sooner. At times, he became tearful when discussing the situation and his sister’s death; at other times, he seemed aloof, speaking about these in a calm, factual way. He also wanted to clarify that his apartment had indeed been a mess but that much of the apparent mess was actually his large collection of articles on bioluminescence, a topic he had been researching for decades.\n\nA licensed plumber, electrician, and locksmith, Mr. Buchalski had worked until age 65. He described his late sister as having been always “a little strange.” She had never worked and had been married once, briefly. Aside from the several-month marriage, she and Mr. Buchalski had lived in the family’s two-bedroom Manhattan apartment their entire lives. Neither of them had ever seen a psychiatrist.\n\nWhen questioned, Mr. Buchalski stated that he had never had a romantic or sexual relationship and had never had many friends or social contacts outside his family. He explained that he had been poor and Polish and had had to work all the time. He had taken night classes to better understand “the strange world we live in,” and he said his intellectual interests were what he found most gratifying. He said he had been upset as he realized that his sister was dying, but he would call it “numb” rather than depressed. He also denied any history of manic or psychotic symptoms. After an hour with the psychiatric trainee, Mr. Buchalski confided that he hoped the medical school might be interested in some of his papers after his death. He said he believed that bioluminescent and genetic technologies were on the verge of a breakthrough that might allow the skin of animals and then humans to glow in subtle colors that would allow people to more directly recognize emotions. He had written the notes for such technology, but they had grown into a “way-too-long science fiction novel with lots of footnotes.”\n\nOn examination, Mr. Buchalski was a thin, elderly man dressed neatly in khakis and button-down shirt. He was meticulous and much preferred to discuss his interests in science than his own story. He made appropriate eye contact and had a polite, pleasant demeanor. His speech was coherent and goal directed. His mood was “fine,” and his affect was appropriate though perhaps unusually cheerful under the circumstances. He denied all symptoms of psychosis, depression, and mania. Aside from his comments about bioluminescence, he said nothing that sounded delusional. He was cognitively intact, and his insight and judgment were considered generally good, although historically impaired in regard to his delay in calling the police about his sister.",

        "vignette": "Henry, a 19-year-old college sophomore, was referred to the student health center by a teaching assistant who noticed that he appeared odd, worried, and preoccupied and that his lab notebook was filled with bizarrely threatening drawings.\n\nHenry appeared on time for the psychiatric consultation. Although suspicious about the reason for the referral, he explained that he generally “followed orders” and would do what he was asked. He agreed that he had been suspicious of some of his classmates, believing they were undermining his abilities. He said they were telling his instructors that he was “a weird guy” and that they did not want him as a lab partner. The referral to the psychiatrist was, he said, confirmation of his perception.\n\nHenry described how he had seen two students “flip a coin” over whether he was gay or straight. Coins, he asserted, could often predict the future. He had once flipped a coin and “heads” had predicted his mother’s illness. He believed his thoughts often came true.\n\nHenry had transferred to this out-of-town university after an initial year at his local community college. The transfer was his parents’ idea, he said, and was part of their agenda to get him to be like everyone else and go to parties and hang out with girls. He said all such behavior was a waste of time. Although they had tried to push him into moving into the dorms, he had refused, and instead lived by himself in an off-campus apartment.\n\nWith Henry’s permission, his mother was called for collateral information. She said Henry had been quiet, shy, and reserved since childhood. He had never had close friends, had never dated, and had denied wanting to have friends. He acknowledged feeling depressed and anxious at times, but these feelings did not improve when he was around other people. He was teased by other kids and would come home upset. His mother cried while explaining that she always felt bad for him because he never really “fit in,” and that she and her husband had tried to coach him for years without success. She wondered how a person could function without any social life.\n\nShe added that ghosts, telepathy, and witchcraft had fascinated Henry since junior high school. He had long thought that he could change the outcome of events like earthquakes and hurricanes by thinking about them. He had consistently denied any substance use disorder, and two drug screens had been negative in the prior 2 years. She mentioned that her grandfather had died in an “insane asylum” many years before Henry was born, but she did not know his diagnosis.\n\nOn examination, Henry was tall, thin, and dressed in jeans and a T-shirt. He was alert and wary and, although nonspontaneous, he answered questions directly. He denied feeling depressed or confused. Henry denied any history of suicidal thoughts, plans, or attempts. He denied having any auditory or visual hallucinations, panic attacks, obsessions, compulsions, or phobias. His intellectual skills seemed above average, and his Mini-Mental State Examination score was 30 out of 30.",

        "vignette": "Ike Crocker was a 32-year-old white divorced carpenter referred for a mental health evaluation by the human resources department of a large construction business that had been his employer for 2 weeks. At his initial job interview, Mr. Crocker presented as very motivated and provided two carpentry school certifications that indicated a high level of skill and training. Since his employment began, his supervisors had noted frequent arguments, absenteeism, poor workmanship, and multiple errors that might have been dangerous. When confronted, he was reportedly dismissive, indicating that the problem was “cheap wood” and “bad management” and added that if someone got hurt, “it’s because of their own stupidity.”\n\nWhen the head of human resources met with him to discuss termination, Mr. Crocker quickly pointed out that he had both attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and bipolar disorder. He said that if not granted an accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act, he would sue. He demanded a psychiatric evaluation.\n\nDuring the mental health evaluation, Mr. Crocker focused on unfairness at the company and on how he was “a hell of a better carpenter than anyone there could ever be.” He claimed that his two marriages had ended because of jealousy. He said that his wives were “always thinking I was with other women,” which is why “they both lied to judges and got restraining orders saying I’d hit them.” As “payback for the jail time,” he refused to pay child support for his two children. He had no interest in seeing either of his two boys because they were “little liars” like their mothers.\n\nMr. Crocker said he “must have been smart” because he had been able to make Cs in school despite showing up only half the time. He spent time in juvenile hall at age 14 for stealing “kid stuff, like tennis shoes and wallets that were practically empty.” He left school at age 15 after being “framed for stealing a car” by his principal. Mr. Crocker pointed out these historical facts as evidence that he was able to overcome injustice and adversity. A review of a juvenile probation officer’s report indicated that beginning in the first grade, he often bullied children with disabilities, was noted to smile when his victims would cry, and consistently lacked remorse or guilt for his actions.\n\nIn regard to substance use, Mr. Crocker said he smoked marijuana as a teenager and started drinking alcohol on a “regular basis” after he first got married at age 22. He denied that use of either substance was a problem.\n\nMr. Crocker concluded the interview by demanding a note from the examiner that he had “bipolar” and “ADHD.” He said that he was “bipolar” because he had “ups and downs” and got “mad real fast.” Mr. Crocker denied other symptoms of mania. He said he got down when disappointed, but he had “a short memory” and “could get out of a funk pretty quick.” Mr. Crocker reported no difficulties in his sleep, mood, or appetite. He learned about ADHD because “both of my boys got it.” He concluded the interview with a request for medications, adding that the only ones that worked were stimulants (“any of them”) and a specific short-acting benzodiazepine.\n\nOn mental status examination, Mr. Crocker was a casually dressed man who made reasonable eye contact and was without abnormal movements. His speech was coherent, goal directed, and of normal rate. There was no evidence of any thought disorder or hallucinations. He was preoccupied with blaming others, but these comments appeared to represent overvalued ideas rather than delusions. He was cognitively intact. His insight into his situation was poor.\n\nThe head of human resources did a background check during the course of the psychiatric evaluation. Phone calls revealed that Mr. Crocker had been expelled from two carpentry training programs and that both of his graduation certificates had been falsified. He had been fired from his job at one local construction company after a fistfight with his supervisor and from another job after abruptly leaving a job site. A quick review of the company’s records indicated that Mr. Crocker had provided them with the same false documentation.",

She had spent the prior 6 months isolated in her apartment, lying in bed, eating junk food, watching television, and doing more online shopping than she could afford. Multiple treatments had yielded little effect.\n\nMs. Delgado was the middle of three children in an upper-middle-class immigrant family in which the father reportedly valued professional achievement over all else. She felt isolated throughout her school years and experienced recurrent periods of depressed mood. Within her family, she was known for angry outbursts. She had done well academically in high school but dropped out of college because of frustrations with a roommate and a professor.\n\nShe had attempted a series of internships and entry-level jobs with the expectation that she would return to college, but she kept quitting because “bosses are idiots. They come across as great and they all turn out to be twisted.” These “traumas” always left her feeling terrible about herself (“I can’t even succeed as a clerk?”) and angry at her bosses (“I could run the place and probably will”). She had dated men when she was younger but never let them get close physically because she became too anxious when any intimacy began to develop. Most of her friends from the neighborhood had “become frauds or losers,” while she had stayed “Facebook friends” with some friends from college, and they were all “doing amazing things all over the world. I’ll definitely meet up with them if they ever come back to town.”\n\nMs. Delgado said that she was generally “down and depressed” but that she had had dozens of 1- to 2-day “manias” in which she was energized and edgy and pulled all-nighters. She tended to “crash” the next day and sleep for 12 hours.\n\nMs. Delgado reported that she occasionally cut herself, “but only superficially.” She had persistent thoughts that she would be better off dead, and she had been psychiatrically hospitalized three times after overdoses.\n\nShe indicated that psychotherapy had never been especially helpful, nor had her medication treatments, which had included mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and low-dose antipsychotic medication.\n\nMrs. Delgado was a casually groomed and somewhat unkempt woman who was cooperative, coherent, and goal directed during the interview. She was generally dysphoric, with a constricted affect, but did smile appropriately several times. She described shame at her poor performance but also believed she was “on Earth to do something great.” She described her father as a spectacular success, but he was also a “Machiavellian loser who was always trying to manipulate people.” She described quitting jobs because people were disrespectful. Toward the end of the initial session, she became angry with the interviewer after he glanced at the clock (“Are you bored already?”).",

The fall had left her downcast and depressed, although she denied other depressive symptoms aside from a poor mood. She spoke at length about the fall and about how it reminded her of a fall that she had sustained a few years earlier. At that time, she had gone to see a neurosurgeon, who told her to rest and take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. She described feeling “abandoned and not cared about” by him. The pain had diminished her ability to exercise, and she was upset that she had gained weight. While relating the events surrounding the fall, Ms. Fuentes began to cry.\n\nWhen asked about her suicidal comments, she said they were “no big deal”—they were “just a threat” aimed at her husband to “teach him a lesson” because “he has no compassion for me” and had not been supportive since the fall. She insisted that her comments about overdosing did not have another meaning. When her ER interviewer expressed concern about the possibility that she would kill herself, she exclaimed with a smile, “Oh wow, I didn’t realize it’s so serious. I guess I shouldn’t do that again.” She then shrugged and laughed. She went on to talk about how “nice and sweet” it was that so many doctors and social workers wanted to hear her story, calling many of them by their first names. She was also somewhat flirtatious with her male resident interviewer, who had mentioned that she was the “best-dressed woman in the ER.”\n\nAccording to her outpatient psychiatrist of 3 years, she had never before expressed suicidal ideation until this week, and he would be unable to check in on her until after he left on vacation the next day. Ms. Fuentes’s husband reported that she talked about suicide “like other people complain about the weather. She’s just trying to get me worried, but it doesn’t work anymore.” He said he would never have suggested she go to the ER and thought the psychiatrist had overreacted.\n\nMs. Fuentes initially sought outpatient psychotherapy at age 47 because she was feeling depressed and unsupported by her husband. During 3 years of outpatient treatment, Ms. Fuentes had been prescribed adequate trials of sertraline, escitalopram, fluoxetine, and paroxetine. None seemed to help.\n\nMs. Fuentes described being “an early bloomer.” She became sexually active with older men when she was in high school. She said dating had been the most fun thing she had ever done and that she missed seeing men “jump through hoops” to sleep with her. She lived with her 73-year-old husband. Her 25-year-old son lived nearby with his wife and young son. She described her husband as a “very famous” musician. She said that he had never helped around the house or with child-rearing and did not appreciate how much work she put into taking care of their son and grandson.",

        "vignette": "Larry Goranov was a 57-year-old man who demanded an expert review of the psychiatric care that he had received for the prior 7 years at a psychiatric clinic connected to a medical school. Mr. Goranov indicated to the clinic’s psychiatric director that he had been depressed for many years, but weekly psychotherapy and multiple different psychiatric medications had made no difference.\n\nMr. Goranov reported feeling sad, tired, and frustrated “for decades.” He rarely looked forward to anything. He had lost his last job 3 years earlier, had broken up with a girlfriend slightly later, and doubted that he would ever work or date again. He was embarrassed that he still lived with his mother, who was in her 80s. He denied any immediate intention or plan to kill himself, but stated that if he did not improve by the time his mother died, he did not see what he would have to live for. He denied disturbances in sleep, appetite, or concentration.\n\nClinic records indicated that Mr. Goranov had been adherent to adequate trials of fluoxetine, escitalopram, sertraline, duloxetine, venlafaxine, and bupropion, as well as augmentation with quetiapine, aripiprazole, lithium, and levothyroxine. He had experienced some improvement in his mood while taking escitalopram but did not have remission of symptoms. He also received a course of cognitive-behavioral therapy early in his treatment, but he had been dismissive of the therapist and treatment, did not do his assigned homework, and appeared to make no effort to use the therapy between sessions.\n\nMr. Goranov expressed frustration at his lack of improvement, the nature of his treatment, and his specific therapy. He found it “humiliating” that he was forced to see trainees who rotated off his case every year or two. He frequently found that the psychiatry residents were not especially educated, cultured, or sophisticated, and thought that they knew less about psychotherapy than he did. He much preferred to work with female therapists “because at least they’re pretty, and men are too competitive and envious.”\n\nMr. Goranov had worked as an insurance broker from age 25 to 40. He explained, “It’s ridiculous. I was the best broker they had ever seen, but I still can’t get a job. I think the problem is that the profession is filled with big egos, and I can’t keep my mouth shut about it.” After being “blackballed” by insurance agencies, Mr. Goranov did not work for 5 years, until he was hired by an automobile dealer. He said that although it was beneath him to sell cars, he was successful, and “in no time, I was running the place.” He quit within a few months after an argument with the owner. Despite encouragement from several therapists, Mr. Goranov had not applied for a job or pursued employment rehabilitation or volunteer work; he strongly viewed these options as beneath him.\n\nMr. Goranov has “given up on women.” He had many partners as a younger man, but he generally found them to be unappreciative and “only in it for the free meals.” Psychotherapy notes from the clinic indicate that he responded to demonstrations of interest with suspicion. This tendency held true in regard to both women who had tried to befriend him and therapists who had taken an interest in his care. Mr. Goranov described himself as someone who had a lot of love to give, but added that the world was full of manipulators. He said he had a few buddies, but his mother was the only one he truly cared about. His parents had emigrated from Eastern Europe when he was a child. He had no siblings, and his father had died when the patient was 41. He had met a few relatives over the years, “but they didn’t speak English, so I didn’t pay them much attention.” He enjoyed fine restaurants and “five-star hotels,” but he added that he could no longer afford them. He exercised daily and was concerned about maintaining his body. Most of his time was spent at home watching television or reading novels and biographies.\n\nOn examination, the patient was neatly groomed, had slicked-back hair, and wore designer hip-hop-inspired clothing generally favored by men in their 20s. He was coherent, goal directed, and generally cooperative. He said he was sad and angry. His affect was constricted and dismissive. He denied an intention to kill himself but felt hopeless and thought of death fairly often. He was cognitively intact.",

She avoided speaking up or talking on telephones, worried about how she would sound. She dreaded public speaking.\n\nShe was similarly reticent with friends. She said she had always been a people pleaser who preferred to hide her feelings with a cheerful, compliant, attentive demeanor. She had a few friends, whom she described as “warm and lifelong.” She felt lonely after her recent move and had not yet met anyone from school or the local community.\n\nShe said she had broken up with her first serious boyfriend 2 years earlier. He had initially been “kind and patient.” Through him, she had a social life by proxy. Soon after she moved in with him, however, he turned out to be an “angry alcoholic.” She had not dated since that experience.\n\nMs. Herbert grew up in a metropolitan area with her parents and three older siblings. Her brother was “hyperactive and antisocial” and took up everyone’s attention, whereas her sisters were “hypercompetitive and perfect.” Her mother was anxiously compliant, “like me.” Ms. Herbert’s father was a very successful investment manager who often pointed out ways in which his children did not live up to his expectations. He could be supportive but tended to disregard emotional uncertainty in favor of a “tough optimism.” Teasing and competition “saturated” the household, and “it didn’t help that I was forced to go to the same girls’ school where my sisters had been stars and where everyone was rich and catty.” She developed a keen sensitivity to criticism and failure.\n\nHer parents divorced during her senior year of high school. Her father married another woman soon thereafter. Although she had planned to attend the same elite university as her two sisters, she chose to attend a local community college at the last minute. She explained that it was good to be away from all the competition, and her mother needed the support.\n\nMs. Herbert’s strengths included excellent work in her major, chemistry, especially after one senior professor took a special interest. Family camping trips had led to a mastery of outdoor skills, and she found that she enjoyed being out in the woods, flexing her independence. She also enjoyed babysitting and volunteering in animal shelters, because kids and animals “appreciate everything you do and aren’t mean.”\n\nDuring the evaluation, Ms. Herbert was a well-dressed young woman of short stature who was attentive, coherent, and goal directed. She smiled a lot, especially when talking about things that would have made most people angry. When the psychiatrist offered a trial comment, linking Ms. Herbert’s current anxiety to experiences with her father, the patient said nothing but was visibly upset. After several such instances, the psychiatrist worried that any interpretive comments might be taken as criticism and had to check a tendency to avoid sensitive subjects. Explicitly discussing his concerns led both the patient and psychiatrist to relax and allowed the conversation to continue more productively.",

He wished someone would tell him where to go next so that he would not have to face the “burden” of decision. At work, he found it easy to follow his boss’s directions but had difficulty making even minor independent decisions. The situation was “depressing,” he said, but nothing new.\n\nMr. Irvin also reported dissatisfaction with his relationships with women. He described a series of several-month-long relationships over the prior 10 years that ended despite his doing “everything I could” and “never getting angry or yelling.” His most recent relationship had been with an opera singer. He reported having gone to several operas and taken singing classes to impress her, even though he did not particularly enjoy music. That relationship had recently ended for unclear reasons. He said his mood and self-confidence were tied to his dating. Being single made him feel desperate, but desperation made it even harder to get a girlfriend. He said he felt trapped by that spiral. Since the latest breakup, he had been quite sad, with frequent crying spells. It was this depression that had prompted him to seek treatment. He denied all other symptoms of depression, including problems with sleep, appetite, energy, suicidality, and ability to enjoy things.\n\nMr. Irvin initially denied taking any medications, but he eventually revealed that 1 year earlier his primary care physician had begun to prescribe alprazolam 0.5 mg/day for “anxiety.” His dose had escalated, and at the time of the evaluation, Mr. Irvin was taking 5 mg/day and getting prescriptions from three different physicians. Cutting back led to anxiety and “the shakes.”\n\nMr. Irvin denied any prior personal or family psychiatric history, including outpatient psychiatric appointments.\n\nAfter hearing this history, the psychiatrist was concerned about Mr. Irvin’s escalating alprazolam use and his chronic difficulties with independence. She thought the most accurate diagnosis was benzodiazepine use disorder comorbid with a personality disorder. However, she was concerned about the negative unintended effects that these diagnoses might have on the patient, including his employment and insurance coverage, as well as how he would be dealt with by future clinicians. She typed into the electronic medical record a diagnosis of “adjustment disorder with depressed mood.” Two weeks later, Mr. Irvin’s insurance company asked her for his diagnosis, and she gave the same diagnosis.",

Mr. Kleinman described a several-month-long apartment search that was made “agonizing” by Mr. Judd’s work schedule and his “endless” list of apartment demands. They were unable to come to a decision, and eventually they decided to just share Mr. Judd’s apartment. As Mr. Kleinman concluded, “Ogden won.”\n\nMr. Judd refused to hire movers for his boyfriend’s belongings, insisting on personally packing and taking an inventory of every item in his boyfriend’s place. What should have taken 2 days took 1 week. Once the items were transported to Mr. Judd’s apartment, Mr. Kleinman began to complain about Mr. Judd’s “crazy rules” about where items could be placed on the bookshelf, which direction the hangers in the closet faced, and whether their clothes could be intermingled. Moreover, Mr. Kleinman complained that there was hardly any space for his possessions because Mr. Judd never threw anything away. “I’m terrified of losing something important,” added Mr. Judd.\n\nOver the ensuing weeks, arguments broke out nightly as they unpacked boxes and settled in. Making matters worse, Mr. Judd would often come home after 9:00 or 10:00 p.m., because he had a personal rule to always have a blank “to-do” list by the end of the day. Mr. Kleinman would often wake early in the morning to find Mr. Judd grimly organizing shelves or closets or cleaning the floor. Throughout this process, Mr. Judd appeared to be working hard at everything while enjoying himself less and getting less done. Mr. Kleinman found himself feeling increasingly detached from his boyfriend the longer they lived together.\n\nMr. Judd denied symptoms of depression and free-floating anxiety. He said that he had never experimented with cigarettes or alcohol, adding, “I wouldn’t want to feel like I was out of control.” He denied a family history of mental illness. He was raised in a two-parent household and was an above-average high school and college student. He was an only child and first shared a room as a college freshman. He described that experience as being difficult due to “conflicting styles—he was a mess and I knew that things should be kept neat.” He had moved mid-year into a single dorm room and had not lived with anyone until Mr. Kleinman moved in. Mr. Judd was well liked by his boss, earning recognition as “employee of the month” three times in 2 years. Feedback from colleagues and subordinates was less enthusiastic, indicating that he was a micromanager on shared projects, and often critical of his colleagues’ efforts. Also, it seemed he had a reputation as a bore, stemming from a happy hour trivia night in which he had repeatedly questioned the answers his coworkers provided.\n\nOn examination, Mr. Judd was a thin man with eyeglasses and gelled hair, sitting on a couch next to his boyfriend. He was meticulously dressed. He was cooperative with the interview and sat quietly while his boyfriend spoke, interrupting on a few occasions to contradict. His speech was normal in rate and tone. His affect was irritable. There was no evidence of depression. He denied specific phobias and did not think he had ever experienced a panic attack. At the end of the consultation, Mr. Judd remarked, “I know I’m difficult, but I really do want this to work out.”",

        "vignette": "Raven Lundquist (she/her, preferring Raven) was a 24-year-old graduate student in philosophy who presented for a psychiatric evaluation at her brother’s insistence. The two siblings lived together, and the brother threatened to withhold her allowance from a small trust if she didn’t get “some help.”\n\nRaven explained that her brother was worried about her being “sadomasochistic.” In public, he might just say that he was worried that she was an alcoholic and out of control, but she thought he just didn’t like her interest in “BDSM” (bondage, domination/discipline, sadism/submission, and masochism).\n\nShe said that she had been in a relationship with Lilly for about a year. The two of them self-identified as queer, a label they found less stigmatizing than “lesbian.” One evening, after an evening of drinking with her brother, Raven told him that she and Lilly enjoyed going to bondage parties, where they would role-play “mistress-slave scenes” in which they would wear tight leather clothing and high heels, and Lilly would whip Raven and call her derogatory or humiliating names. Raven was fine with being seen as a masochist in public, but in private, she generally enjoyed being in charge.\n\nRaven asked the psychiatrist whether he was “the kind of shrink who pathologizes everything? Surely, you’re not like my brother, who gets squeamish about anything related to kink. But that’s his problem, right doctor? Don’t you agree that his concerns are just homophobia?” She asked whether the psychiatrist had read Justine by the Marquis de Sade, “which isn’t as well written as Lolita, but it strikes a chord. By the way, Lilly laughs at my reading choices, calling me an ‘old-school perv.’ ”\n\nOn questioning about other BDSM activities, Raven said she sometimes drugged Lilly without Lilly’s knowledge. She found the sense of control to be extremely sexually exciting. Raven said she did not think Lilly would mind if she found out, given that Lilly identified as a sadomasochist and would often let Raven tie her up. Raven admitted that she had secretly drugged previous sexual partners, but that only one had complained about it, and “only when she found photos on my camera.” That lover had broken off the relationship immediately and claimed that she would have gone to the police if the “photos weren’t so embarrassing.”\n\nWhen asked about her brother’s concern about her alcohol use, Raven immediately said she did “no illegal drugs, no tobacco, not even weed.” Upon further questioning, she did say she might have an alcohol problem. She said she often planned to have a single drink but generally ended up getting significantly intoxicated. She generally got along well with Lilly and her brother, but they often got into verbal fights after everyone had “become really drunk.” She said she often enjoyed her “binges,” with the only problem being that she often missed early morning classes because of hangovers. She had no criminal history.\n\nRaven’s childhood history was notable for having been abandoned by their mother while young. She and her brother had lived with relatives and in foster homes before they had been adopted by a woman whom she referred to as our “intrusive but well-meaning pseudo-mother.” That woman had died the year before, leaving behind a small trust fund for the two of them. Raven had memory gaps from her childhood and thought she might have been sexually molested. “The abuse narrative would make sense, wouldn’t it? But I really don’t remember.” Raven’s medical history was pertinent for having had scoliosis; as a child, she was treated with insertion of a Harrington rod and an extended hospitalization.\n\nRaven described sexual attraction to both men and women but preferred women because “they are typically more submissive.” When she masturbated, and when she drugged sexual partners, she fantasized about “power and control,” particularly about molesting unwilling partners.\n\nShe said she felt calm when in sexual control, and when intoxicated, but that she otherwise felt “pretty anxious.” Previous psychiatrists had diagnosed her with generalized anxiety disorder, for which she had been prescribed a benzodiazepine; these were also the medications she used to drug sexual partners.\n\nRaven said she sometimes felt down and depressed but did not think she had ever had a “clinical depression.” While often anxious, she denied ever having phobias or panic. She denied ever feeling suicidal but had sometimes thought about killing the drugged sexual partners, which, “as you surely know, I would never actually do.” She denied obsessions, compulsions, delusions, and hallucinations. She was intelligent and cognitively intact.",

        "vignette": "Terry Najarian, a 65-year-old salesman for a large corporation, presented for a psychiatric evaluation after his wife threatened to leave him. Although he said he was embarrassed to discuss his issues with a stranger, he described his sexual interest in women’s undergarments in a quite matter-of-fact manner. This interest had surfaced several years earlier and had not been a problem until he was caught masturbating by his wife 6 weeks prior to the evaluation. Upon seeing him dressed in panties and a bra, she initially “went nuts,” thinking he was having an affair. After he clarified that he was not seeing anyone else, she “shut him out” and hardly spoke to him. When they argued, she called him a “pervert” and made it clear that she was considering divorce unless he “got help.”\n\nMr. Najarian’s habit began in the setting of his wife’s severe arthritis and likely depression, both of which significantly reduced her overall activity level and specifically her interest in sex. His “fetish” was the bright spot during his frequent and otherwise dreary business trips. He also masturbated at home but generally waited until his wife was out of the house. His specific pattern was to masturbate about twice weekly, using bras and panties that he had collected over several years. He said that intercourse with his wife had faded to “every month or two” but was mutually satisfying.\n\nThe patient had been married for over 30 years, and the couple had two grown children. Mr. Najarian had planned to retire comfortably later that year, but not if the two choices were either “to be poor after we split the assets or to sit around the house all day and be called a pervert.”\n\nHe became visibly anxious when discussing his marital difficulties. He described some recent difficulty falling asleep and “worried constantly” about his marriage but denied other psychiatric problems. He had made a show of throwing away a half dozen pieces of underwear, which had seemed to reassure his wife, but he had saved his “favorites” and “could always buy more.” He said he was of mixed mind. He did not want to end his marriage, but he saw nothing harmful in his new mode of masturbating. “I’m not unfaithful or doing anything bad,” he said. “It just excites me, and my wife certainly doesn’t want to be having sex a few times a week.”\n\nMr. Najarian denied any difficulties related to sexual functioning, adding that he could maintain erections and achieve orgasm without women’s undergarments. He recalled being aroused when he touched women’s underwear as a teenager and had masturbated repeatedly to that experience. That fantasy had disappeared when he became sexually active with his wife. He denied any personal or family history of mental illness.",

        "vignette": "Vance Orren was a 28-year-old self-reported cisgender heterosexual man who was arrested after pushing a stranger in front of an oncoming subway train. He told police that he believed the man was going to “tell everyone that I was a faggot” and that he, Mr. Orren, was trying to protect himself from the “homosexual conspiracy.”\n\nMr. Orren had a history of a psychotic disorder, a cocaine use disorder, and nonadherence to medication and psychotherapy at the time of the incident. He was unemployed. In court, Mr. Orren entered a plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease (the “insanity defense”) and underwent a full psychiatric evaluation, including assessment of his sexual history and desires.\n\nAs part of his legal case, Mr. Orren underwent a structured sex offender evaluation. He reported that his first sexual contact was at age 12, when his uncle and an 18-year-old male cousin “did things” to him while he was in foster care. They would take him to McDonald’s afterward, “so it was fine.” By the time he was 14 or 15, he was regularly having sex with males and females who ranged in age “from about ten to in their thirties.”\n\nHe was unable to answer whether the sexual contact was always consensual, saying, “No one ever called the cops.” As an adult, he said that he preferred having sex with “young girls, because they don’t fight much.” He said that he usually only had sex with adults when he hired prostitutes or prostituted himself in exchange for money or drugs, although he said that sometimes when high, he “might have done stuff that I don’t really remember.”\n\nThe structured sex offender evaluation included penile plethysmography, assessment of visual reaction time using Viewing Time (a measure of the amount of time a person looks at a particular photo or other visual representation of a sexually stimulating situation), and a detailed interview about his sexual practices. This evaluation concluded that his main sexual attraction was to girls between the ages of 8 and 13 years.\n\nMr. Orren’s personal history was significant for multiple childhood disruptions that led to his moving into the foster care system at age 7. At age 9, his first foster mother caught him repeatedly stealing toys and bullying other children. When she reprimanded him, he hit her with a brick, knocking her unconscious. That led to placement in a second foster home. He began using drugs and alcohol at age 11. He was first incarcerated at 13, for shoplifting from an electronics store in order to obtain money for marijuana. At that point, he went back to live with his maternal grandmother, who has episodically provided him a home since then. During those 15 years, he has been arrested at least a dozen times, mostly for drug possession.\n\nMr. Orren stopped attending school in eighth grade, at about the same time that he was admitted to his first psychiatric inpatient unit. That admission was triggered by his beating his head against a wall “to stop the voices.” He was given a DSM-IV diagnosis of psychosis not otherwise specified, treated with risperidone, and discharged after 1 week. Soon after discharge, he discontinued the antipsychotic medication.\n\nBetween the ages of 15 and 28, Mr. Orren regularly abused cocaine and alcohol and often used other substances when they were available. By the time of his arrest, he had had at least seven psychiatric admissions, always for auditory hallucinations and persecutory delusions (usually of a sexual nature). It was not clear which substances he was using prior to and during these episodes of psychosis or whether they were implicated in the development of his psychiatric symptoms. He had also been admitted twice for alcohol detoxification after he went into withdrawal while unable to acquire alcohol. He was consistently nonadherent to any type of outpatient treatment. He maintained sobriety only while in hospitals or jails. When contacted by the consulting psychiatrist, his grandmother pointed out that Mr. Orren had always been “reckless, dishonest, and angry. I don’t think I’ve ever heard him apologize. I love him, but he probably belongs in jail for lots of reasons.”",

Leroy reports he was recently recommended by his present physician to see a psychiatrist again, given how distressing his intrusive thoughts have become. His previous psychiatrist started him on Zoloft, and gave him recommendation for community based mental health psychotherapist.  Leroy has been taking the Zoloft (200 mg daily) for about 5 years, for what he states his provider thought was “anxiety or depression.” Leroy acknowledges history of periods of “sadness”, stating “yeah sad, sometimes, but not depressed; when things get out of control; its been a while though; when something feels out of reach.” Denied present or past suicidal ideation, and denied problems with active thoughts, plans or intents of harm to self or others. Leroy insists no problems with perceptual distortion or paranoia, and denied thought insertion or thought broadcasting.  Leroy stated that the intrusive thoughts, “first started happening when I was a kid, I was able to cope with them; getting better understanding what they were; ways to get them to go away; calm myself down and regain control and go on with my life; now that is not working.” Leroy states the most recent intrusive thought has been a fear that the chart bus he drives from his local airport to downtown stop will “slide off the road because of ice or snow.” He thinks about this, on average, about 30 to 45 minutes a day.  Leroy endorsed episodes of “panic” and “my body almost feels like its paralyzed; I experience pain from my spine up”, which lasts for a couple of days at a time. With regards to “generalized anxiety”, patient reports “I would have these thoughts about my ailing mother; she has schizophrenia; my body would react to whatever I was thinking about her; my body tenses up when that happens.” Leroy denied any preoccupations about his physical health, nor inability to leave the home because of anxiety. He reports to work regularly, and rarely misses any work unless he is very sick. He says he is never late to work or planned appointments. Leroy has a girlfriend, and says that relationship is going “great.” In his spare time, he continues to join his friends for basketball pickup games and video game nights, which he still enjoys. Leroy does remember a feeling of having to tap the door handle a few times before he opens it, but said this never lasted more than a few second and was not associated with any fear of catastrophic consequences if he did not complete the task.  Leroy acknowledges observed violence/abuse of his parents when growing up, and with harsh parenting to his 3 siblings, patient denied problems with flashbacks, nightmares or hypervigilance associated with the trauma. Patient works second shift, gets home around 1:30 a.m., reports falling asleep at 2:30 a.m. and wakes up at 10/11 a.m., and can typically sleep through the night without interruption. He reports his energy level is “normal through the week.” Denied recent or past mania. Reports contributing stressors are “work --- not the most peaceful environment.” Also reports mother suffers from “type of schizophrenia and for a while she was taking medication and just recently now decided to stop; that’s been going on for quite some time.” Leroy’s urine toxicology returned with marijuana, and TSH level was within normal limits.",

Most of the patients psychiatric history is gathered from her mother, given how irritable the patient is during the exam. The mother reports Neveah was born 8 weeks pre-mature, spent about 1 month in the neonatal intensive care unit due to problems with breathing, and ultimately discharged home to her care at one month of age. The patient met developmental milestones on or near expected time, and was “clingy” when she was a toddler, but had no problems making friends in daycare and grade school. When patient was about 11 years of age, her biological father left the home to join the military, and has deployed ever since. Around 12 years of age, around summertime, the patient appeared much more talkative, energetic, and would go several days only needing about 3 hours of sleep at night. She was more impulsive during these times, and believed she had super powers to “make her friends get in trouble at school”, even when she was not at school herself.

During that same period, she had many temper tantrums throughout the day, almost every day of the week, that seemed disproportionate to circumstances, like having to have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich instead of a peanut butter and fluff sandwich.

The eye blinking slowly went away, but seemed to be replace by Melanie contorting her neck repeatedly, and especially when getting ready for school or leaving the house.

He reports a significant history of head trauma (8 concussions), one seizure episode while incarcerated, and multiple incarcerations for offenses including gun possession, burglary, and vehicle theft.

Their psychiatric history includes diagnoses of MDD and GAD at age 15-16, PTSD in 2016 following emotional abuse by high school friends, and ADHD in 2018 (without neuropsychological evaluation). Current medications include Lisdexamfetamine 50mg (since 2018), various supplements, and a contraceptive injection.

        "case": "The patient is an 18-year-old non-binary college freshman with a complex psychiatric presentation. They report a history of childhood anxiety, perfectionism, and ritualistic self-punishment behaviors starting in the third grade. Currently, their most debilitating symptom is anxiety about \"contaminated air\" when others cough or sneeze, prompting them to cover their face and hold their breath even when the trigger is far away or on television. They engage in checking and counting behaviors based on the number 3, including checking mirrors while driving, locking/unlocking their car, and tapping their toothbrush. These compulsions are experienced as uncontrollable, with the patient reporting they sometimes modify behaviors (like holding an imaginary door handle in their pocket) when the original compulsion would be disruptive. At approximately age 16, the patient developed anorexia nervosa, restricting their food intake and ultimately requiring intervention from parents and a treatment team. Despite gaining weight under external pressure, the patient continues to restrict eating, has a distinct fear of gaining weight, becoming fat, fasting until dinner, drinking coffee to intentionally upset their stomach. Their BMI currently falls within the normal range. Around the same time their eating disorder developed, the patient experienced depressive symptoms including hopelessness, low motivation, and self-harm behaviors (pulling hair, cutting, punching stomach). They had suicidal ideation during high school, including thoughts of jumping in front of a train and fantasizing about wandering into hallways during a school shooting. Current suicidal thoughts are less frequent and persistent. Current depressive symptoms have been subsyndromal (though not entirely absent) for about 7 months. Specifically, the patient currently denies experiencing depressive symptoms for more than a few hours every couple of weeks but rates their chance of self-harm in the next three months at 50% (suicide attempt chance at 0%). They report minimal alcohol and marijuana use. Notably, the patient expresses resistance to treatment, stating that \"getting better means getting fat\" and feeling they need to \"stay sad for a while longer\".",

She recently transitioned from working as a childcare specialist to self-employment as a freelancer. Her medical history includes anemia and IBS, for which she takes daily iron supplements. The patient previously attempted treatment with Zoloft (10mg) for OCD symptoms but discontinued due to emotional blunting effects. She reports consuming alcohol 1-2 glasses a few times monthly and using marijuana daily when available, which she finds helpful for intrusive thoughts despite occasionally triggering anxiety. The patient's most distressing symptoms involve intrusive thoughts about sexually harming children, accompanied by physiological responses that she describes as \"groinal\". These thoughts were particularly distressing during her work as a childcare specialist, where she engaged in compulsive staring at children's genital areas to \"prove\" she wasn't sexually attracted to them and sometimes avoided changing diapers due to fear of sexual arousal. After experiencing an intrusive dream about sexually harming her brother in January 2021, she experienced physical symptoms (shaking, freezing) when interacting with him and subsequently increased their time together as a form of reassurance. Additionally, the patient reports significant health anxiety focused on getting cancer, HIV, and STIs, leading to excessive symptom research. The patient experiences panic attacks (1-2 times monthly) lasting 15-30 minutes when triggered by intrusive thoughts, with symptoms including shortness of breath, crying, sweating, racing heart, chest pain, and feelings of detachment. She reports seeking reassurance from her mother when these thoughts become overwhelming. The patient also endorses distressing and functionally impairing social anxiety in small groups, leading to significant avoidance; however, she stated that this anxiety is primary due to her unwanted/intrusive thoughts rather than a fear of being judged. She reports experiencing over 50 depressive episodes in the past year, each lasting at least two weeks with symptoms including decreased appetite, sleep disturbance, fatigue, guilt, concentration difficulties, and thoughts of death. She described these episodes as challenging to manage, but \"not completely debilitating\".",

He lives with his biological parents and seven-year-old brother, with whom he has \"constant\" conflict including arguing, screaming, and hitting. Erik has a developmental history of severe temper tantrums prior to age 4, with behavioral challenges emerging in kindergarten and worsening in subsequent grades. His mother reports that her son engages in \"constant defiance\", experiences rapid mood changes, and demonstrates impulsive behavior, including occasional incidents of pulling knives (though never pointing them at anyone). Daily arguments at home frequently escalate to physical aggression, particularly with his mother and brother. Erik has expressed statements such as \"I wish I could go to sleep and never wake up\" and reports feeling depressed \"randomly\" a couple times per month since second or third grade, though he denies daily depressive symptoms or changes in sleep or appetite. Erik's behavioral difficulties have manifested in both home and school environments. In school, he has engaged in speaking out of turn, refusing to follow directions, agitating teachers, and having \"screaming matches\" with staff. Despite these challenges, Erik maintains high grades across subjects (with math being his most difficult class at a B), has several friends, and is described as a leader in social interactions. He has a Section 504 plan that allows for movement opportunities and frequent breaks when needed. In March 2019, Erik began taking 2mg of Guanfacine (extended release) for attention/concentration deficits, which has helped reduce impulsivity and improve behavioral control, though aggressive and defiant behaviors have continued. His mother reports implementing a point system for rewards and consequences but notes limited effectiveness due to inconsistent expectations between parents. Formal assessment indicates that Erik demonstrates a pattern of emotional dysregulation, defiance, and aggressive behavior, with physical aggression occurring approximately every other day at home. Assessment also confirms prior symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, which are present across settings and contribute to emotional dysregulation and academic underperformance relative to ability.",

His symptoms have included paranoid ideation, auditory and visual hallucinations, delusions (such as believing television was sending special messages), obsessive thoughts, compulsive behaviors, and periods of mania and depression. Dole holds a master’s degree in computer science and previously developed cybersecurity systems but resigned in 2019 due to unmanageable anxiety. He currently lives with his parents, who provide significant assistance with daily activities. Throughout his treatment history, Dole has demonstrated paranoid thoughts beginning at age 19, with recurrent episodes of acute psychosis requiring hospitalization. In 2018, he experienced hallucinations of messages on his phone, and in 2019, he reported seeing \"the devil\" and experiencing auditory hallucinations. He endorses unwanted/intrusive thoughts causing anxiety, which he attempts to neutralize with repetitive behaviors that take 1-3 hours daily. His symptoms include fear of harming himself, violent imagery, concerns about germs, and moral preoccupations. Dole reports deficits in procedural and episodic memory, impairing self-care and accurate recollection of past events. His family history is positive for paternal psychosis, depression with possible bipolar disorder, and a completed suicide. Intake impressions indicate that Dole has experienced (and continues to experience) delusions, hallucinations, disorganized/catatonic behavior, diminished emotional expression, and amotivation within a one-month period.

The patient reports that this behavior began at age 27 (late 2017) and involves involuntary staring at people he does not know well, with particular focus on the genitals/breasts of all genders and ages, including children. He spends approximately six hours per day engaged in or thinking about this behavior, which he cannot control through willpower alone, though he can interrupt it by creating a physical barrier in his line of sight or wearing sunglasses. The patient initially denied but later acknowledged experiencing unwanted sexual thoughts regarding his sexual orientation. This behavior has significantly impaired his functioning, causing him to lose multiple jobs within the past year, avoid family gatherings, limit time in public, and experience relationship strain with his girlfriend of 12 years, with whom he has three children and now stays home while she works. The patient experiences moderate suicidal ideation, including thoughts that he would be better off dead, and reports feeling worthless and guilty, particularly about \"not providing for my children and for staring\". He describes his mood as \"iffy\" and notes increased irritability. While the patient endorsed panic attacks on assessment, follow-up questioning revealed these occur specifically when thinking excessively about his staring behaviors or unemployment, rather than occurring spontaneously. He also endorsed criteria for agoraphobia and social anxiety on screening, though these appear directly related to fears of being judged for his staring behavior. The patient acknowledged witnessing a traumatic event he chose not to disclose but denied re-experiencing or avoidance symptoms consistent with PTSD. Medical history includes hypertension treated with Amlodipine (dose unknown), with no psychiatric medication history reported.Throughout the assessment, the patient demonstrated limited insight into his symptoms, was guarded in his responses, and had not disclosed his problems to his long-term partner. While he reported some depressive symptoms, these did not meet sufficient symptoms for major depressive disorder but were nonetheless clinically significant.",

He felt like the government was going to come get him and use the weapons in his home against him. He recalls going to the neighbor's home in an attempt to have her hide his knives for him.

He refused to provide urine sample but allowed a blood draw. His blood work returned with elevated white blood count (WBC) at 18 x10e3/uL.

He does not recall his diagnosis from that admission. Patient agreed to receive further care at a psychiatric facility and was voluntarily transferred to an inpatient psychiatry unit. Patient was started again on Seroquel but refused to take it during admission. He was seen napping during the day and reported some stomach cramping to the treatment team.
