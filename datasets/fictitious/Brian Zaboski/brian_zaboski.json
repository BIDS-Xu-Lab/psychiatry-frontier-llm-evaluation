        "case": "Patient is a 59-year-old female with an unassessed complex trauma history presenting with not-just-right sensations related to hair and bumps growing on her face that cause substantial distress, despite acknowledging that the hairs and bumps are not always physically present. To manage this distress, she keeps tweezers on her person at all times, checks mirrors every 30 minutes when at home, and avoids staying home for extended periods. She also exhibits contamination concerns manifesting as excessive handwashing (25+ times daily) and using barriers to avoid direct contact with \"unclean\" surfaces out of fear of contracting an illness. Patient believes that she must act on her physical sensations or contamination-related thoughts most of the time or the distress will persist. Patient also collects items like My Little Ponies and Trolls. She has filled her home, garage, basement, a rented warehouse, and now pays to store items in a neighbor's garage despite saying she has little to no money to pay for these expenses. She expresses strong attachment to these possessions, stating she would \"NEVER\" sell them, and has a history of repurchasing items she previously attempted to sell. Patient's medical history is significant for AIDS (diagnosed 2003, currently on Odefsey), and past surgical interventions following a car accident. Her psychological history includes previous diagnoses of PTSD and Bipolar Disorder (which she disputes). Current symptoms of a major depressive episode include anhedonia, restlessness, sleep disturbance (averaging 4 hours nightly), feelings of worthlessness, and difficulty concentrating. These episodes emerge roughly every few month. The patient denied symptoms of psychosis as well as symptoms related to higher than usual energy or goal-directed activity at any time in the past. She endorsed suicidal ideation without current plan or intent, rating likelihood of attempt at 1%. Social support is reportedly limited, with the patient living alone with her two dogs, having infrequent contact with her daughter, and minimal social connections beyond casual acquaintances while shopping. She denied distress or functional impairment resulting from any traumatic events.",

        "case": "The patient is a 25-year-old male who presented with delayed responses and was vaping during intake. He currently works full-time managing his hot tub repair company and lives with his girlfriend. His medical history includes multiple substance addictions, particularly opioids (requiring Suboxone and later Methadone treatment), and previous diagnoses of OCD, ADHD, anxiety disorder, and depressive disorder. He reports a significant history of head trauma (8 concussions), one seizure episode while incarcerated, and multiple incarcerations for offenses including gun possession, burglary, and vehicle theft. His psychiatric medication history includes Adderall, Concerta, Zoloft, an unspecified antidepressant, and Trazodone. The chief complaint involves symptoms that began at approximately age 18 during his first incarceration and have intensified in the past year, coinciding with work stress. Problematic behaviors include arranging items in specific places with extreme rigidity (unable to buy new items that don't have a \"place\"), performing rituals in sets of three, and a specific handwashing ritual. He experiences intrusive thoughts about harming others (particularly fears of stabbing, shooting, or raping strangers) and engages in compulsive behaviors (brushing his hand from hairline to ear three times) to alleviate associated anxiety. He also reports persistent checking behaviors due to memory doubts, a need for things to feel \"just right\", and specific ordering rituals. Additionally, he endorses current anhedonia, decreased appetite, fatigue, and concentration difficulties that wax and wane every few months. He shared that these symptoms are distressing, though mildly impairing in his social, work, and leisurely activities. He denies current suicidality, self-harm, or hallucinations/delusions. He reports a childhood history of conduct problems (skipping school, lying, stealing, fighting) and adult behaviors including illegal activities, irresponsibility, deceitfulness (e.g., using fake identifications) and reported guiltlessness after harming others or damaging property. His childhood conduct problems (e.g., fighting) have resulting in the concussions reported in the medical history, and his illegal activities have resulted in two incarcerations. When asked about one such activity (stealing a car), he reported no remorse, instead blaming the victim for calling the police. The assessment revealed that these behaviors have continued for years in multiple settings, though as of late, he reported that he has not engaged in any illegal activities because he does not want to return to jail for a third time.",

        "case": "Patient is a 25-year-old transgender male currently living with parents who are reportedly non-supportive, and he works as a hospital lab technician. He presents with severe symptoms characterized primarily by intrusive thoughts related to morality, contamination, and harm. Unwanted thoughts include fears of transmitting sexual fluids to others (which he believes would make him \"a rapist\"), concerns about accidentally killing insects, moral distress about consuming animal products, and beliefs that viewing violent media constitutes \"condoning\" violence. To manage these thoughts, he engages in extensive reassurance seeking, repeatedly checking lab results at work, avoiding video games and television, dietary restrictions, and some handwashing. He reports these symptoms significantly interfere with daily functioning, preventing him from living independently. They cause intense distress that frequently culminates in panic attacks. Patient has a complex history related to his gender identity, reporting he has identified as male throughout his life despite being assigned female at birth. He is currently taking low-dose testosterone but conceals this from his family, who he believes are interfering with his plans for gender-affirming surgeries. He reported childhood \"delusions\" about being \"from a fantasy world and chosen by gods\" that resolved by age 18. Patient previously took fluvoxamine for panic symptoms until approximately age 24, reporting significant symptom exacerbation upon discontinuation. He describes himself as introverted with limited social connections, identifying as asexual, though questioning if this might be avoidance related to triggering thoughts. His social anxiety dates back to middle and high school, when he was \"pretty much mute\" with few friends. Patient describes his mood as \"always a little depressed\" with recent intensification. He endorses feeling sad, empty, and hopeless most days, anhedonia, sleep disturbances, psychomotor retardation, fatigue, worthlessness, guilt, concentration difficulties, and suicidal ideation. He frequently believes he \"needs to be dead\" and that suicide would be \"the moral thing to do\" following morally repugnant intrusive thoughts, though he denies current plan or intent (estimating a 5% chance of suicide within three months). He struggles with activities of daily living without parental support and expresses frustration that his thoughts and behaviors interfere with his gender expression. Despite these significant symptoms, he demonstrates good insight, noting that his thoughts are not consistent with who he is and what he values.",

Currently unemployed but financially stable for the near term, she is pursuing employment opportunities abroad with plans to relocate to Vietnam in September 2021. The patient lives alone with no local support system and has recently withdrawn from her social connections following concurrent stressors of job loss and the death of her pet cat, expressing irritation with friends' \"bad advice\". She denies substance use, maintains good physical health aside from requiring iron supplementation, and reports a childhood head injury at age 11 without loss of consciousness. Patient describes longstanding organizational tendencies dating back to approximately age 8, recalling precise block stacking and meticulous desk organization throughout her schooling. These behaviors were particularly pronounced during her high school years when her family sponsored relatives' citizenship, resulting in 16 people residing in her home. She demonstrates consistent contamination-related behaviors, including using barriers when touching public surfaces, frequent hand sanitization (predating the pandemic), and immediate cleaning of any perceived contamination. The patient engages in regular cleaning throughout the day, reporting an inability to tolerate \"a single dirty dish in the sink\" and an immediate need to address any uncleanliness she observes. Notably, she denies these behaviors cause distress or any impairment, stating she \"enjoys\" cleaning and maintaining organization. Patient reported persistent depressed mood, anhedonia, restlessness, fatigue, and feelings of worthlessness over the past two weeks, but said that these symptoms are manageable. She denies current or past suicidal ideation. While she denies feeling \"up\", \"high\", or \"hyper\", she describes persistent irritability manifesting as social withdrawal and increased argumentativeness, characterizing herself as \"more lucid\" than others because she doesn't \"follow the script\". She denies symptoms consistent with mania or hypomania, including grandiosity, decreased need for sleep, pressured speech, racing thoughts, distractibility, or increased goal-directed activity. The patient acknowledges experiencing an unspecified \"extremely traumatic event\" but denies re-experiencing it in distressing ways. Assessment ruled out panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, substance use disorders, psychotic disorders, eating disorders, and generalized anxiety disorder.",

They describe their living situation as \"overwhelming\" due to parental boundary issues, though they maintain a supportive romantic relationship since 2019. Their psychiatric history includes diagnoses of MDD and GAD at age 15-16, PTSD in 2016 following emotional abuse by high school friends, and ADHD in 2018 (without neuropsychological evaluation). Current medications include Lisdexamfetamine 50mg (since 2018), various supplements, and a contraceptive injection. They previously tried multiple antidepressants (2011-2015) but discontinued each after approximately two weeks due to suicidal ideation and, in one case, motor disturbances. The patient consumes alcohol socially (3-5 drinks monthly) and has been vaping marijuana 1-3 times weekly for three months primarily to aid sleep and manage anxiety. The patient's primary symptoms onset around age 5 with intrusive visualizations of falling down stairs along with perfectionism through rewriting notes until they felt \"just right\". Currently, they experience significant distress when surroundings are not in the \"right spot\", spending up to 12 hours reorganizing belongings without breaks, which would cause severe distress if interrupted. This \"not just right\" feeling impairs their ability to meet deadlines, complete job applications, and fulfill social obligations. They also engage in checking behaviors when packing (counting socks repeatedly, checking for essential items) and experience distressing sexual intrusive thoughts. Additionally, the patient exhibits skin-picking behaviors, spending over an hour picking at ingrown hairs until bleeding, scratching their neck and jaw during conversations, and tearing at cuticles, with symptoms worsening during periods of anxiety. They've attempted to stop by wearing pants constantly but have been unsuccessful. The patient has a significant history of depression with three past suicide attempts (overdoses in 2014, 2015, and 2017) and self-injury through cutting (stopped in 2017). They currently experience passive suicidal ideation, anhedonia, decreased appetite, sleep difficulties, psychomotor agitation, feelings of worthlessness, and concentration problems, though they report 0% chance of self-harm in the next three months. Social anxiety manifests as persistent fear of judgment and rejection, with distressing rumination about social interactions and excessive reassurance-seeking that has cost them friendships. The patient also reported past sexual abuse by a boyfriend for 4-5 months but denied PTSD symptoms. They disclosed a history of binge eating episodes. During the binge, they ate more rapidly than normal and felt disgusted and embarrassed after. After these eating binges, pt fasted for ~3 days. These eating binges occurred <1 time per week, and the patient has not engaged in these behaviors in the past 2 months.",

        "case": "The patient is an 18-year-old non-binary college freshman with a complex psychiatric presentation. They report a history of childhood anxiety, perfectionism, and ritualistic self-punishment behaviors starting in the third grade. Currently, their most debilitating symptom is anxiety about \"contaminated air\" when others cough or sneeze, prompting them to cover their face and hold their breath even when the trigger is far away or on television. They engage in checking and counting behaviors based on the number 3, including checking mirrors while driving, locking/unlocking their car, and tapping their toothbrush. These compulsions are experienced as uncontrollable, with the patient reporting they sometimes modify behaviors (like holding an imaginary door handle in their pocket) when the original compulsion would be disruptive. At approximately age 16, the patient developed anorexia nervosa, restricting their food intake and ultimately requiring intervention from parents and a treatment team. Despite gaining weight under external pressure, the patient continues to restrict eating, has a distinct fear of gaining weight, becoming fat, fasting until dinner, drinking coffee to intentionally upset their stomach. Their BMI currently falls within the normal range. Around the same time their eating disorder developed, the patient experienced depressive symptoms including hopelessness, low motivation, and self-harm behaviors (pulling hair, cutting, punching stomach). They had suicidal ideation during high school, including thoughts of jumping in front of a train and fantasizing about wandering into hallways during a school shooting. Current suicidal thoughts are less frequent and persistent. Current depressive symptoms have been subsyndromal (though not entirely absent) for about 7 months. Specifically, the patient currently denies experiencing depressive symptoms for more than a few hours every couple of weeks but rates their chance of self-harm in the next three months at 50% (suicide attempt chance at 0%). They report minimal alcohol and marijuana use. Notably, the patient expresses resistance to treatment, stating that \"getting better means getting fat\" and feeling they need to \"stay sad for a while longer\".",

She recently transitioned from working as a childcare specialist to self-employment as a freelancer. Her medical history includes anemia and IBS, for which she takes daily iron supplements. The patient previously attempted treatment with Zoloft (10mg) for OCD symptoms but discontinued due to emotional blunting effects. She reports consuming alcohol 1-2 glasses a few times monthly and using marijuana daily when available, which she finds helpful for intrusive thoughts despite occasionally triggering anxiety. The patient's most distressing symptoms involve intrusive thoughts about sexually harming children, accompanied by physiological responses that she describes as \"groinal\". These thoughts were particularly distressing during her work as a childcare specialist, where she engaged in compulsive staring at children's genital areas to \"prove\" she wasn't sexually attracted to them and sometimes avoided changing diapers due to fear of sexual arousal. After experiencing an intrusive dream about sexually harming her brother in January 2021, she experienced physical symptoms (shaking, freezing) when interacting with him and subsequently increased their time together as a form of reassurance. Additionally, the patient reports significant health anxiety focused on getting cancer, HIV, and STIs, leading to excessive symptom research. The patient experiences panic attacks (1-2 times monthly) lasting 15-30 minutes when triggered by intrusive thoughts, with symptoms including shortness of breath, crying, sweating, racing heart, chest pain, and feelings of detachment. She reports seeking reassurance from her mother when these thoughts become overwhelming. The patient also endorses distressing and functionally impairing social anxiety in small groups, leading to significant avoidance; however, she stated that this anxiety is primary due to her unwanted/intrusive thoughts rather than a fear of being judged. She reports experiencing over 50 depressive episodes in the past year, each lasting at least two weeks with symptoms including decreased appetite, sleep disturbance, fatigue, guilt, concentration difficulties, and thoughts of death. She described these episodes as challenging to manage, but \"not completely debilitating\".",

He lives with his biological parents and seven-year-old brother, with whom he has \"constant\" conflict including arguing, screaming, and hitting. Erik has a developmental history of severe temper tantrums prior to age 4, with behavioral challenges emerging in kindergarten and worsening in subsequent grades. His mother reports that her son engages in \"constant defiance\", experiences rapid mood changes, and demonstrates impulsive behavior, including occasional incidents of pulling knives (though never pointing them at anyone). Daily arguments at home frequently escalate to physical aggression, particularly with his mother and brother. Erik has expressed statements such as \"I wish I could go to sleep and never wake up\" and reports feeling depressed \"randomly\" a couple times per month since second or third grade, though he denies daily depressive symptoms or changes in sleep or appetite. Erik's behavioral difficulties have manifested in both home and school environments. In school, he has engaged in speaking out of turn, refusing to follow directions, agitating teachers, and having \"screaming matches\" with staff. Despite these challenges, Erik maintains high grades across subjects (with math being his most difficult class at a B), has several friends, and is described as a leader in social interactions. He has a Section 504 plan that allows for movement opportunities and frequent breaks when needed. In March 2019, Erik began taking 2mg of Guanfacine (extended release) for attention/concentration deficits, which has helped reduce impulsivity and improve behavioral control, though aggressive and defiant behaviors have continued. His mother reports implementing a point system for rewards and consequences but notes limited effectiveness due to inconsistent expectations between parents. Formal assessment indicates that Erik demonstrates a pattern of emotional dysregulation, defiance, and aggressive behavior, with physical aggression occurring approximately every other day at home. Assessment also confirms prior symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, which are present across settings and contribute to emotional dysregulation and academic underperformance relative to ability.",

His symptoms have included paranoid ideation, auditory and visual hallucinations, delusions (such as believing television was sending special messages), obsessive thoughts, compulsive behaviors, and periods of mania and depression. Dole holds a master’s degree in computer science and previously developed cybersecurity systems but resigned in 2019 due to unmanageable anxiety. He currently lives with his parents, who provide significant assistance with daily activities. Throughout his treatment history, Dole has demonstrated paranoid thoughts beginning at age 19, with recurrent episodes of acute psychosis requiring hospitalization. In 2018, he experienced hallucinations of messages on his phone, and in 2019, he reported seeing \"the devil\" and experiencing auditory hallucinations. He endorses unwanted/intrusive thoughts causing anxiety, which he attempts to neutralize with repetitive behaviors that take 1-3 hours daily. His symptoms include fear of harming himself, violent imagery, concerns about germs, and moral preoccupations. Dole reports deficits in procedural and episodic memory, impairing self-care and accurate recollection of past events. His family history is positive for paternal psychosis, depression with possible bipolar disorder, and a completed suicide. Intake impressions indicate that Dole has experienced (and continues to experience) delusions, hallucinations, disorganized/catatonic behavior, diminished emotional expression, and amotivation within a one-month period. He has exhibited delusions or hallucinations for at least two weeks in the absence of major mood episodes, and his functioning has decreased notably compared to his pre-symptom baseline. Regarding his unwanted/intrusive thoughts, he demonstrates limited insight.",

        "case": "Patient is a 32-year-old Black American male with no prior diagnostic history who presents with a chief complaint of \"uncontrollable staring, particularly at breasts/genitals\". The patient reports that this behavior began at age 27 (late 2017) and involves involuntary staring at people he does not know well, with particular focus on the genitals/breasts of all genders and ages, including children. He spends approximately six hours per day engaged in or thinking about this behavior, which he cannot control through willpower alone, though he can interrupt it by creating a physical barrier in his line of sight or wearing sunglasses. The patient initially denied but later acknowledged experiencing unwanted sexual thoughts regarding his sexual orientation. This behavior has significantly impaired his functioning, causing him to lose multiple jobs within the past year, avoid family gatherings, limit time in public, and experience relationship strain with his girlfriend of 12 years, with whom he has three children and now stays home while she works. The patient experiences moderate suicidal ideation, including thoughts that he would be better off dead, and reports feeling worthless and guilty, particularly about \"not providing for my children and for staring\". He describes his mood as \"iffy\" and notes increased irritability. While the patient endorsed panic attacks on assessment, follow-up questioning revealed these occur specifically when thinking excessively about his staring behaviors or unemployment, rather than occurring spontaneously. He also endorsed criteria for agoraphobia and social anxiety on screening, though these appear directly related to fears of being judged for his staring behavior. The patient acknowledged witnessing a traumatic event he chose not to disclose but denied re-experiencing or avoidance symptoms consistent with PTSD. Medical history includes hypertension treated with Amlodipine (dose unknown), with no psychiatric medication history reported.Throughout the assessment, the patient demonstrated limited insight into his symptoms, was guarded in his responses, and had not disclosed his problems to his long-term partner. While he reported some depressive symptoms, these did not meet sufficient symptoms for major depressive disorder but were nonetheless clinically significant.",
