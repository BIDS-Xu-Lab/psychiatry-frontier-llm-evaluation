        "case": "A 32-year-old male with a past medical history of polysubstance use disorder (cocaine, marijuana, and methamphetamine) presents for bizarre behavior brought in by emergency medical services (EMS) after a neighbor called to report that patient was outside her home threatening her with a knife. Per neighbor's report, the patient had been yelling about the FBI and demanding to be let into her home while waving a knife. Patient was yelling at paramedics enroute and attempted to punch a paramedic when being loaded into the ambulance. Upon arrival to the emergency room, patient was agitated, requiring emergency intermuscular injection of medications to deescalate. Patient told doctors in the emergency room that he felt unsafe and needed them to watch his knives for him. He felt like the government was going to come get him and use the weapons in his home against him. He recalls going to the neighbor's home in an attempt to have her hide his knives for him. A few hours later, the psychiatry team came to evaluate the patient, at which point the patient appeared drowsy and asked to be left alone due to feeling tired. He refused to provide urine sample but allowed a blood draw. His blood work returned with elevated white blood count (WBC) at 18 x10e3/uL. He denied having any prior psychiatric diagnoses but admitted that he has been using methamphetamine recently. He recalls he had been admitted to an inpatient psychiatry service before, around 1 year prior after using meth, where he stayed for 3 days and was discharged on Seroquel, which patient denied currently taking. He does not recall his diagnosis from that admission. Patient agreed to receive further care at a psychiatric facility and was voluntarily transferred to an inpatient psychiatry unit. Patient was started again on Seroquel but refused to take it during admission. He was seen napping during the day and reported some stomach cramping to the treatment team. By day 3 of admission, patient reported feeling well and signed himself out of the hospital.",

        "reasoning": "Patient only has known history of 1 prior episode of psychosis, which appeared to be in the setting of substance use (meth). Patient this time also admitted to using meth recently. While urine sample was not obtained, an elevated WBC can be indicative of methamphetamine use in the absence of infection. Additionally, fatigue and gastrointestinal upset are common symptoms of stimulant withdrawal. Resolution of symptoms in a short course of only 3 days and without medication is another evidence for substance-induced psychosis rather than a primary psychotic disorder. However, with such limited history, an underlying primary psychotic disorder cannot be fully ruled out and thus antipsychotic treatment may still be indicated.",

        "case": "A 16-year-old male in the 9th grade with no known past psychiatric history presented as a walk-in admission to the county psychiatric hospital with his mother. He started seeing a therapist recently after mom noticed that he was talking to her less and appeared less energetic. Mom reports that the patient has also been behaving oddly, accusing downstairs neighbors to be trying to spy on him and talking poorly about him. She also reports that he told her he feels unsafe because people are trying to harm him. She also noticed that he has been more irritable, occasionally punching walls but never people. When patient was interviewed directly, he appeared constricted and dysphoric, with hair covering his eyes. He spoke softly. He reported that he has been feeling angry because he has been thinking more about how his biological father used to abuse his mom, even though his biological father no longer is in their life. He reports that he has been experiencing poor memory, poor concentration, feeling anxious and ruminating frequently. He also admits to having thoughts of death several months ago and does have access to guns although he has never attempted to kill himself. He does report that he intentionally cut his wrist a few months ago to cope with his feelings but denied having suicidal intent. He also endorses poor sleep and low mood. He admits that he is a long-time bars user (referring to Xanax) but does not know the dosage and is evasive when asked about his frequency and most recent use. He also reports that he smokes marijuana but again does not provide details regarding his use. He states that more recently, he started using marijuana specifically to help with new-onset paranoia. He describes his mind playing tricks on him, morphing objects into faces leading to feeling scared. Lab work collected at the hospital did not show abnormalities other than a positive urine cannabinoid screen. Patient was started on fluoxetine for his depression symptoms and aripiprazole for his psychotic symptoms and he improved after a week on this medication combination, reporting better mood and no longer feeling paranoid.",

        "case": "A 14-year-old male patient with a history of generalized anxiety disorder is brought to his pediatrician for a skin exam after she saw the patient wiping his skin down with a Clorox wipe. She reports that since the start of COVID in 2020, patient has been more vigilant about keeping his space and belongings clean, wiping down his devices upon returning from any outing, wiping down doorknobs, light switches, and bathroom counters daily. She states that initially, he feared catching COVID. However, she states it has been 3 years of such behaviors and believes that his cleaning behaviors have actually intensified. She noticed that he started washing his hands more often, sometimes showering multiple times in a day, and last week, saw him use a Clorox disinfecting wipe to clean his body. She became concerned for the potential of chemical irritation on his skin. When patient was addressed directly, patient reports that he needs everything to be clean. He expresses an intense fear that his belongings and space are contaminated with germs if he does not clean then regularly. He alludes to his view of the outside as “dirty” and that his room is “clean.” He feels the intense urge to have anything that enters his room to be decontaminated otherwise his whole room will become contaminated. He describes an intense feeling of anxiety if he cannot clean things before they enter his room. He states that he spends a lot of time washing his hands because if he misses a spot or brushes his hand against the side of the sink, he needs to start over to ensure that they are fully clean. He endorses similar patterns with showering and wiping down belongings, often needing to start over to ensure he did not miss any spots and has fully decontaminated. He does mention that he has been struggling in school due to having less time to study with his cleaning obligations.",

He reports that he took a handful of pills (escitalopram) that he has prescribed for anxiety. He reports that 2 days ago, his girlfriend was angry at him and suggested that she was thinking about leaving the relationship. The patient reports that he felt very hurt and wanted to show her how much he was hurt by her statement, which is why he took the pills. He described the act as impulsive and wasn’t sure if he truly wanted to die in the moment. He states that he does not regret his decision but also denies any suicidal ideation (SI) currently. He also denies feeling depressed prior to the fight. He states that his friends and loved ones “always” leave him and that he was hurt because he thought his girlfriend was different. When asked about outpatient care, he expressed a mistrust for mental health providers, stating that most of them “just don’t get it” and that he is still working on finding a therapist who understands him. He says that the last clinic assigned him a female provider even though he requested a male provider. He admits that they stated they didn’t have any male providers available at the time, but still feels that they betrayed him by making him false promises. He endorses feeling like he isn’t worth other people’s time and feeling depressed often, especially when relationships or friendships don’t work out. He denies recent insomnia, appetite changes, concentration or memory issues, and anhedonia. He is seen to have multiple healed lacerations on bilateral forearms, which he states are scars from cutting. He asks the provider if they think he may have bipolar disorder or autism because he feels like he gets “mood swings” and has difficulty in keeping friends.

        "case": "Patient is a 31-year-old female denying any psychiatric history who was transferred to the county psychiatry hospital from a local emergency room for threatening to kill herself. She tells the evaluating psychiatrist that she had gotten into an argument with her husband. She states that she and her husband has been living in a hotel for the past week due to a conflict between her and her mother-in-law. She reports that she feels her husband does not understand nor respect her because he was requesting to return home to be closer to his workplace. She states that she was surprised at the argument because he is usually a “good man.” When asked what made her feel disrespected this time, she replied it was because he was refusing her request to continue staying at the hotel and that he usually never says no to her. When asked her reason for staying, she stated that she just “did not feel ready” to return home yet because being around her mother-in-law stressed her out. She did not understand why her husband was not accommodating her discomfort. However, when pointing out husband’s discomfort with the long commute time to work, she minimized his concern and did not acknowledge his struggle, instead redirecting the conversation to her own feelings. When asked about the reason for her disagreement with her mother-in-law, she states it is because her mother-in-law does not recognize her efforts for contributing to the household. She states that, “My mother-in-law always complains that I don’t do chores and don’t work. But she doesn’t get it that I’m the one supporting my husband at his job and that he should be the main breadwinner anyways as the husband. Besides, I did the dishes today, it’s not even true that I don’t do chores.” When addressing the physicians, she addresses them casually (e.g. “dude,” “man,” etc.) and states to them, “You’re a doctor, you should be smart enough to understand me.” She denies that she has any mental issues that requires her to remain in the hospital, stating that, “Smart people like us, we get misunderstood, you get it right? That’s why they sent me here.” She also alludes to believing that her mother-in-law called the police to have her brought here to get her away from her husband because she’s “jealous I get to spend more time with her son than she does.” When informing her that the reason for her hospitalization was the threat of suicide, she casually waves it off, stating, “Oh, I don’t actually want to kill myself, I just said that to get my husband to listen to me.”",
