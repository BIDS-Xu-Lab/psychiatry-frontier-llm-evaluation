        "case": "A 15-year-old Hispanic female with a history of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), stable on a low dose selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) for over a year, presented to the outpatient clinic with new-onset symptoms over the past 3–4 weeks including insomnia, panic attacks, and difficulty concentrating. The patient described a significant emotional event occurring two months ago: the death of her pet cat. She reported persistent crying spells, intrusive flashbacks of her cat’s death and burial, loss of appetite, and trouble falling asleep. She denied anhedonia, active or passive suicidal ideation, and maintained that she still enjoys going to school and spending time with friends and her younger sister. Despite these supports, she has noticed a decline in academic performance due to frequent, intrusive thoughts about her pet, particularly during class. She also reported an incident two weeks ago, when she became short of breath, diaphoretic and had experienced palpitations and had to excuse herself to “get some fresh air” in the middle of her music class. Washing face with cold water helped. Reported worrying about similar thing might happen again. During the evaluation, the patient presented with a constricted affect and became tearful while recalling memories of her cat but appeared more cheerful when discussing positive aspects of her life. She reported ongoing support from her mother, stepfather, and friends. Although she continues to engage in previously enjoyed activities like listening to music and socializing, she noted difficulty maintaining focus and occasionally “loses her train of thought” due to preoccupying memories of her cat—something she had never experienced before.",

        "reasoning": "This seems like adjustment disorder triggered by grief-related response. Criteria A: time line -developed within 3 months of the stressor; Criteria B: Impairment in functioning; Criteria C: Doesn’t seem like merely an exacerbation of her previous GAD and the depression, panic attacks, and intrusive thoughts are new.",

        "case": "A 20-year-old African American male with no prior psychiatric history presented to the emergency department with a one-week history of abnormal behavior, depressed mood, and headaches. He had been functioning well and working full-time until the onset of symptoms. One month prior, he had tested positive for COVID-19. Initial symptoms included anxiety, insomnia, depressed mood, and headache, which rapidly progressed to auditory hallucinations, paranoia, and functional impairment, raising concerns for an acute psychiatric or neurological process. On the third day of psychiatric hospitalization, the patient became selectively mute, immobile, and refused oral intake. He developed a low-grade fever and intermittent twitching of the right arm. Trials of haloperidol, benztropine, olanzapine, lorazepam, and hydroxyzine were ineffective. Due to the concern for seizures, he was transferred to an inpatient neurology unit. Workup included basic labs (within normal limits), unremarkable brain imaging, and an EEG showing moderate encephalopathy without epileptiform activity or clinical seizures. Autoimmune encephalitis was considered and investigated, but no definitive diagnosis was established. During neurology admission, there was no clinical improvement. Psychiatry was re-consulted, and the patient showed partial response to benzodiazepines. Gradual improvement was noted, with return of speech, mobility, and normalized vital signs. He was transferred to a long-term acute care facility, where he continued to improve. Within one month, he achieved full recovery and was discharged home.",

        "case": "A 16-year-old Asian male with no prior psychiatric history presented to an outpatient clinic following concerns raised by his school nurse about dizziness, low blood pressure, and significant weight loss. The patient reported feeling overwhelmed with school and experiencing depressed mood over the past 6-8 months. School staff filed a CPS report due to concern for neglect, prompting an investigation that revealed poor nutritional status and recommended mental health and nutritional support. The patient had a low BMI and reported dizziness on standing, suggesting possible orthostatic hypotension secondary to malnutrition. On psychiatric evaluation, the patient appeared dysphoric with downcast eyes and exhibited significant thought blocking, though he was able to follow commands during the physical exam. He maintained a constricted affect and avoided eye contact. The patient disclosed feelings of being overwhelmed by academic pressure but provided limited verbal communication overall. He nodded yes when asked if he had recurrent death thoughts. Nodded yes when asked if he had a plan but didn’t disclose the plan. His family was unaware of the severity of his condition, though they acknowledged his recent withdrawal, tiredness, lack of appetite and weight loss. A history of school bullying was reported, though developmental history was otherwise unremarkable. Decision was made to voluntarily admit the patient. By the second day of inpatient psychiatric admission, the patient's condition deteriorated further. He stopped speaking entirely, refused to move, refused food, did not follow directions, and presented with staring and unusual mannerisms.",
        "diagnosis": "Major Depressive Disorder single episode, severe, with catatonia (F32.2)",
        "reasoning": "MDD single episode, severe, with catatonia is important to discuss here because the condition would require treatment of catatonia first as it may be life threatening. Catatonia symptoms: stupor, mannerism, and negativism. It's important to treat catatonia and hence the diagnosis of catatonia should be made along with depression.",

        "case": "A 29-year-old female, 10-days postpartum, presented with her husband for new-onset command auditory hallucinations, decreased sleep, poor hygiene and paranoia. The patient has a diagnosis of bipolar 1 disorder, and stopped taking her medications at the beginning of pregnancy. The patient seemed very distant to her baby but denied any thoughts of harming the baby. This is the first time that patient experienced such symptoms, and she was admitted to the psychiatric unit for evaluation and management. Initial mental status exam on admission revealed flight of ideas, inappropriate laughter, paranoid delusions, distractibility, poor hygiene and hyper talkativeness. Laboratory tests were clinically unremarkable. Olanzapine was started and titrated appropriately. Melatonin and temazepam nightly were started to regulate her circadian rhythm. Due to lack of effect, olanzapine was changed to risperidone. After 1-week of admission, significant improvement in her symptoms were noticed. Her sleep condition stabilized initially, and she demonstrated a partial return to baseline functioning, with improved mood and cognition. The patient was discharged on day 10. However, after a week of her discharge, the patient experienced a relapse of some of her symptoms. She became increasingly agitated, paranoid, and starting responding to internal stimuli. The family later reported that they stopped giving the medication upon discharge as the patient seemed back to baseline and with a worry that the medications may be excreted in breast milk. Restarting psychotropics resulted in marked improvement, and the patient’s condition stabilized once again.",

        "diagnosis": "Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) (F34.81)",
        "reasoning": "The patient’s presentation can easily be confused with Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), however the chronic irritability, temper tantrums, academic impairment and overall timeline and frequency of symptoms favor more of DMDD symptoms. Interestingly, a child can-not be diagnosed with ODD and DMDD at the same time and hence its important to differentiate.",

The patient was calm, cooperative and logical in thought process. She reported that the recent behavior began a 6 weeks ago, a few weeks after the death of her two pet cats and also worsened in the context of ongoing other family-related psychosocial stressors such as death of her only sibling (brother) who was residing at a nursing home. The patient described a similar episode approximately 45 years ago following the “institutionalization of my brother”, when she witnessed the “shocking” treatment of her brother after his first psychotic episode. She reported that she picks her skin and doesn’t like the feel of scabs afterwards. She reported an intense desire to picks on her scabs which often bleed and she reported a sense of gratification immediately but feeling guilt and shame a few minutes later. She had to visit a dermatologist because of recent wound infection due to picking of her lower lip skin. She shared that her lower lip was extremely tender at that time. She tried wearing gloves to stop her behavior but she continues to pick at scabs and healing skin, particularly on her face. She is currently on the maximum dose of an SSRI and receives care for chronic back pain. The patient is a retired hypnotherapist and forensic psychologist, and tried self-hypnosis with no improvement. She also acknowledged that consuming news media worsens her anxiety and shared that she uses marijuana, which she believes helps her cope.",

The patient reported marked distress and have repeatedly tried to stop the behavior. Although she uses marijuana, substance use is chronic and there is no evidence that substance use is directly causing the picking. Dermatological causes were also evaluated and ruled out. Insight is preserved and the patient is not delusional or psychotic.",

        "case": "A 16-year-old Hispanic female, immigrated to the United States two years ago from a conflict-affected region in South America, presented to the child psychiatry clinic for follow up evaluation and with recent complaints of frequent and severe verbal outbursts at school. The patient had a documented history of chronic sexual abuse and has also witnessed violence, both in her country of origin and during migration. She was accompanied by her biological mother. The patient presented for an initial evaluation six months ago and was lost to follow up since then. At that time, a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was made by the same outpatient mental health provider. The patient reported significant improvement in frequency and intensity of nightmares since started on medications six months ago. Re-established care because the school staff reported frequent episodes (occurring one-two times per week) in which the patient would become suddenly angry, shouting profanities and making personally hurtful comments toward teachers, administrators, and peers. These episodes were often precipitated by perceived criticism, sudden changes in expectations, or ambiguous social cues. Despite these outbursts, the patient was described as highly intelligent, academically capable, and frequently helpful to classmates. She was logical and articulate in conversations when calm but maintained a guarded and cautious interpersonal style. During clinical interview, the patient was initially reserved but opened up during the later parts of the interview. She endorsed persistent feelings of anger, mistrust, and fear, particularly in unfamiliar or male authority-driven environments. She denied hallucinations, current suicidal ideation, or substance use. Sleep disturbances, including frequent nightmares and early-morning awakenings, were reported. Cognitive assessment suggested average to above-average intellectual functioning, and no evidence of developmental delays or psychotic symptoms was noted or reported. Prior to migration, the patient had limited access to formal education, which appeared to contribute to a heightened sensitivity to perceived failure or criticism in the current school environment.",
