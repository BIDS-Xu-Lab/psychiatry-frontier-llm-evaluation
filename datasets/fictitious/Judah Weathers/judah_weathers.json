        "case": "Leroy is a 34 year old male, whose chief complaint is, “I am having intrusive thoughts.” Leroy reports that “since childhood, I have been experiencing intrusive thoughts.” He reports he has met with a number of psychiatrists in the past, and has tried a range of different psychiatric medications. Leroy reports he was recently recommended by his present physician to see a psychiatrist again, given how distressing his intrusive thoughts have become. His previous psychiatrist started him on Zoloft, and gave him recommendation for community based mental health psychotherapist.  Leroy has been taking the Zoloft (200 mg daily) for about 5 years, for what he states his provider thought was “anxiety or depression.” Leroy acknowledges history of periods of “sadness”, stating “yeah sad, sometimes, but not depressed; when things get out of control; its been a while though; when something feels out of reach.” Denied present or past suicidal ideation, and denied problems with active thoughts, plans or intents of harm to self or others. Leroy insists no problems with perceptual distortion or paranoia, and denied thought insertion or thought broadcasting.  Leroy stated that the intrusive thoughts, “first started happening when I was a kid, I was able to cope with them; getting better understanding what they were; ways to get them to go away; calm myself down and regain control and go on with my life; now that is not working.” Leroy states the most recent intrusive thought has been a fear that the chart bus he drives from his local airport to downtown stop will “slide off the road because of ice or snow.” He thinks about this, on average, about 30 to 45 minutes a day.  Leroy endorsed episodes of “panic” and “my body almost feels like its paralyzed; I experience pain from my spine up”, which lasts for a couple of days at a time. With regards to “generalized anxiety”, patient reports “I would have these thoughts about my ailing mother; she has schizophrenia; my body would react to whatever I was thinking about her; my body tenses up when that happens.” Leroy denied any preoccupations about his physical health, nor inability to leave the home because of anxiety. He reports to work regularly, and rarely misses any work unless he is very sick. He says he is never late to work or planned appointments. Leroy has a girlfriend, and says that relationship is going “great.” In his spare time, he continues to join his friends for basketball pickup games and video game nights, which he still enjoys. Leroy does remember a feeling of having to tap the door handle a few times before he opens it, but said this never lasted more than a few second and was not associated with any fear of catastrophic consequences if he did not complete the task.  Leroy acknowledges observed violence/abuse of his parents when growing up, and with harsh parenting to his 3 siblings, patient denied problems with flashbacks, nightmares or hypervigilance associated with the trauma. Patient works second shift, gets home around 1:30 a.m., reports falling asleep at 2:30 a.m. and wakes up at 10/11 a.m., and can typically sleep through the night without interruption. He reports his energy level is “normal through the week.” Denied recent or past mania. Reports contributing stressors are “work --- not the most peaceful environment.” Also reports mother suffers from “type of schizophrenia and for a while she was taking medication and just recently now decided to stop; that’s been going on for quite some time.” Leroy’s urine toxicology returned with marijuana, and TSH level was within normal limits.",

I also lost my career as a farmer.” The patient reports “My girlfriend and I had a good relationship when I used to be able to fish with her; she was a blue blood from the Cape.” Patient reports that he survived being “attacked when I was at a local bar about 4 years ago; the guy smashed a few beer bottles on my head; I had to go to the hospital and they did brain scans; I don’t remember what they said they found.” Patient reports that after that attack, he stopped fishing and started drinking alcohol heavily, at least 8 standard drinks per day, resulting in him missing work, the end of his relationship with his girlfriend, and resulted in getting two DUIs.

        "case": "Neveah is a 14 year old girl that comes to her pediatrician with her mother (presently 4 months pregnant) due to “out of control behaviors at home.” The patient appears restless in the exam room and requiring redirection from her mother throughout the visit. The patient frequently punches her mother in the legs, and in the stomach, and the patient even threw her ipad at the pediatrician when she asked the patient what was upsetting her. Most of the patients psychiatric history is gathered from her mother, given how irritable the patient is during the exam. The mother reports Neveah was born 8 weeks pre-mature, spent about 1 month in the neonatal intensive care unit due to problems with breathing, and ultimately discharged home to her care at one month of age. The patient met developmental milestones on or near expected time, and was “clingy” when she was a toddler, but had no problems making friends in daycare and grade school. When patient was about 11 years of age, her biological father left the home to join the military, and has deployed ever since. Around 12 years of age, around summertime, the patient appeared much more talkative, energetic, and would go several days only needing about 3 hours of sleep at night. She was more impulsive during these times, and believed she had super powers to “make her friends get in trouble at school”, even when she was not at school herself. She was never tired the following day. During that same period, she had many temper tantrums throughout the day, almost every day of the week, that seemed disproportionate to circumstances, like having to have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich instead of a peanut butter and fluff sandwich. The tantrums would last several hours in a day. This pattern of behavior would last for several weeks at a time, with periods of months returning to normal mood and behavior. The patient never appeared to be hallucination or responding to internal stimuli, and never appeared sad or depressed. Neveah had to be hospitalized during an episode like this when she was 13 years old. Neveah refuses to take medications for her symptoms. The start of this year academic year, that patient appeared more calm and in good behavioral control, but began to have similar symptoms of irritability, violence at home, not needing to sleep, talking fast, and property destruction at home.",

Elain tried to rescue the pedestrian, and even helped paramedics the responded to the scene provide chest compressions to the pedestrian.
