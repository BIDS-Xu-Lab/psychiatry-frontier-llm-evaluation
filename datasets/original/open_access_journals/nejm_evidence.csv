"A 12-year-old girl presented to the general pediatrics clinic with nausea, vomiting, and a weight loss of 4 pounds. Starting 1 year ago, she felt nauseated daily and vomited nonbilious stomach contents once every few months. She had intentionally decreased her food intake to avoid vomiting but also had poor appetite and early satiety. She reported intermittent abdominal pain that occurred most days, usually in the morning. She also described intermittent dizziness and occasional mild headaches. There were no fevers, joint pains, mouth sores, dysphagia, odynophagia, or diarrhea. The patient has a history of anxiety, constipation, and eczema. She has not yet experienced menarche. She is not currently taking any medications. She has no known drug allergies. Her sister has obsessive-compulsive disorder. The patient identifies as a girl and uses she/her pronouns. She lives with her mother, father, and older sister. She is in the 7th grade. She reports substantial anxiety about school and does not have any friends there. She occasionally takes ballet lessons but does not participate in any other extracurricular activities. She has had passive suicidal ideation in the past but does not currently have passive or active suicidal ideation. She has not used any illicit substances and has never been sexually active. The patient thinks she is losing weight because she is limiting her food intake. Over the past year, she has had increasing anxiety surrounding becoming ill, germs, and fear that she will not do well in school. She thinks the anxiety regarding school is a major trigger for her nausea and being overly full is an additional trigger for emesis. She is hypervigilant about satiety and will stop eating prematurely to avoid vomiting. The patient and her family have followed a vegetarian diet for many years without the recent addition of any new foods. She has recently started to limit the variety of foods she eats, particularly oily and rich foods, as she fears those will trigger nausea. She has no desire to lose weight and does not have difficulty accessing food. The patient describes the abdominal pain as diffuse and vague, circumferential around her abdomen, and worst in the left lower quadrant. It is triggered both by hunger and food intake and precludes her from eating but not from doing other activities. The pain improves if she stops eating or defecates. The patient has not had changes in her stooling habits. She has two to three formed to semi-formed stools per day, with no blood or nocturnal stooling. She previously had mild constipation for which she took senna tea, but it has now resolved.",Crohn's disease,"In this patient’s case, given her severe malnutrition and difficulty with food acceptance, she was treated with a regimen of exclusive enteral nutrition via nasogastric tube and infliximab infusions. Intravenous iron was also administered to replete her iron stores. She continued to work with psychologists to address her fears regarding food. The inflammation responded well to infliximab therapy, and subsequent surveillance colonoscopy showed mucosal and histologic healing. She continued to struggle with anxiety regarding food and received a diagnosis of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder. She continued therapy with a psychologist. Her weight and growth improved, and at 2-year follow-up she was in the 5th percentile for height and the 5th percentile for weight, with a BMI in the 21st percentile.",A 12-Year-Old Girl with Weight Loss,https://evidence.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/EVIDmr2200308,nejm_evidence
