         "A black male in his early 20s with a remote history of depression as an adolescent and current cannabis use presented following an assault while incarcerated. He was found unconscious with mental status changes and brought to the hospital. Initial examination and work-up revealed right-sided periorbital edema and ecchymosis. The patient was arousable to noxious stimuli but would quickly return to sleep and was not interactive during multiple examination attempts. The emergency department staff believed there was a volitional component to his lack of participation in the exam, as he would push away from providers as they examined him or lie unresponsive. At one point, the patient was able to ambulate briefly while in the emergency department (although he ran into several objects) and tolerated an oral intake challenge with juice. Over the course of 5 days, the patient was returned to the emergency department by the facility four more times due to concerns that his mental status was not improving. The facility reported the patient was unable to attend to his ADLs. He was seen to be withdrawn, not eating or drinking, and toileting on himself or the floor. Additionally, guards (as he was incarcerated for part of his hospital admission) reported that he would occasionally speak to family members and staff. However, when he was offered paperwork to sign himself out of jail with an ankle monitor, he only gazed at the officer without speaking.\n\nUrine toxicology was positive for THC and a negative blood alcohol level. He was found to have ketones consistent with starvation ketosis. Lumbar puncture revealed CSF cell count with six total nucleated cells present, <2,000 RBC, 54 mg/dL glucose, and 39 mg/dL protein. Meningitis/encephalitis panel for 14 common viral and bacterial pathogens and antibody testing for West Nile Virus was negative. CT of the head showed no fractures of the face/vertebra and was negative for other acute findings. EEG was read as consistent with a normal drowsy state. MRI of the brain, both with and without contrast, showed a cerebellar developmental venous anomaly but no acute findings. A neurology consult was obtained. His neurologic exam was noted to be variable, with poor participation despite repeated prompting, making full examination difficult. He responded to pain equally in all extremities, demonstrated no abnormal movements, had 2+ reflexes symmetrically, and normal pupillary response. Neurology ultimately felt that his LP, MRI, and EEG were unremarkable, and his symptomatology could be explained by postconcussive symptoms.\n\nOnce the patient was admitted, he was initially treated with a trial of Modafinil for suspected postconcussive syndrome, to which there was no response. On Day 6 of his hospitalization, when the psychiatric consultation service reconsidered his disordered behavior, psychomotor retardation, and speech with consideration for the presence of catatonia, the question of “volitional” inactivity took on a new meaning. There were numerous catatonia signs present to variable degrees: mutism, decreased oral intake, negativism, withdrawal, and decreased spontaneous movement. No automatic obedience, ambitendency, or rigidity was appreciated. ",

         "A 12-year-old male with no specific birth or medical history became concerned about lower abdominal distention and began reducing his food intake 3 months prior to consultation. He exercised obsessively according to his food intake. Although he was considerably losing weight, he commented that his belly was fat and did not want it to get any fatter. Body image disturbances and anxiety regarding being overweight were observed. During his initial consultation, he was very lean, with a body mass index (BMI) of 11.5 kg/m2. He also had sinus bradycardia with a heart rate of approximately 40 beats/min. We attempted to improve his weight with enteral nutritional supplements while identifying underlying diseases by head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and abdominal ultrasound. However, he became disoriented and was emergently hospitalized 7 days after his first visit. On admission, he was 145 cm tall, weighed 20.9 kg (BMI: 9.9 kg/m2), and presented with impaired consciousness with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) E3V4M6, bradycardia with a heart rate of about 40 beats/min, and slow breathing with a respiratory rate of about 10 cycles/min. Blood gas analysis and blood test revealed hypercapnia, hypoglycemia, and elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and transaminases. His movements were slow but not paralytic and his cranial nerves were normal. ",

         "We report on a 35-year-old female with a history of schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, and cocaine use disorder, with multiple previous psychiatric admissions, who was brought to our hospital's crisis unit after her parents called police, complaining that she had become aggressive and was “acting delusional” during an argument. According to her parents, the patient had demanded a DNA test to prove that her parents were not her biological parents and that her son was not her biological son. One week prior to admission, the patient's parents had reported her missing when she “disappeared” from their home soon after being discharged from our hospital following a similar presentation. Prior to admission, the patient's medications included lamotrigine, clonazepam, and long-acting injectable aripiprazole; however, her adherence to treatment recommendations was poor.\n\nAlthough her parents claimed that she resided with them and her 2-year-old son, the patient endorsed a recent history of homelessness lasting several months. The patient said that during this period of homelessness, she had been sexually assaulted by a stranger in his hotel room. Collateral revealed that per court order, the patient's continued custody of her son was contingent on her adherence to psychotropic medications and inpatient drug rehabilitation. The patient admitted to using recreational drugs frequently over the past 6 months, including crack cocaine, which she stated she had used during the 1-week interval between hospitalizations.\n\nDuring her initial mental status examination, the patient was poorly groomed, uncooperative, intrusive, and irritable. Her speech was pressured, and she described her recent sleep as poor. She commented that she intended to become pregnant and to sell the baby to an agency for $6,000. She made religious statements about “being fruitful and multiplying” and admitted to recently engaging in hypersexual behavior, explaining that “I have boyfriends on the streets.” She underwent testing for sexually transmitted infections, with reassuring results. She declined voluntary inpatient psychiatric admission and was subsequently screened and committed. We discontinued clonazepam at the time of admission, and we restarted the patient on lamotrigine, adding oral aripiprazole to supplement her long-acting injectable aripiprazole.\n\nDuring her hospitalization, the patient faced several barriers to efficient psychiatric stabilization. First among these was her insistence on refusing any medications that might cause weight gain, including olanzapine. She endorsed allergies to haloperidol, risperidone, lurasidone, and lithium, with symptoms such as “anxiety,” “eye rolling,” and “facial twitching” in response to these drugs. Because she was adherent to oral lamotrigine and aripiprazole, we chose not to seek treatment over objection to administer a stronger antipsychotic medication that would also serve as an effective mood stabilizer. On hospital Day 4, the patient appeared virtually in family court, where she received an ultimatum to cooperate with treatment recommendations in order to maintain custody of her son. Nonetheless, she remained adamant about not being placed on “weight gainers,” stating that “I can have nine more babies. I want to be sexy.” On hospital Day 6, she tested positive for COVID-19 and was quarantined for 10 days on a medical floor. Her respiratory symptoms included cough and rhinorrhea, and she continued to display manic symptoms, including elated affect, hyperverbality, grandiosity, religious preoccupation, and inappropriate laughter. She exhibited behaviors suggestive of sexual preoccupation, such as raising her shirt during interviews to reveal a protuberant abdomen and repeatedly endorsing a desire to “stay sexy.”\n\nAfter her quarantine, the patient returned to the psychiatric unit with her manic symptoms unresolved. On hospital Day 17, she requested a pregnancy test due to concerns that she might have become pregnant because she “had sex with a bunch of guys because I was homeless.” The patient seemed reassured when we explained that her admission pregnancy test was negative. We ordered a new quantitative β-hCG test, which was likewise negative. On Day 18, the patient received a maintenance dose of long-acting injectable aripiprazole. On Day 19, she complained of abdominal and back pain, stating “I've been in labor since last night.” She elaborated that “I can feel the head in my crotch” and “when I lay on my back, I feel the little hands and feet.” She also stated that her “water broke” and her “mucus plug broke.” The patient exhibited several physical signs and symptoms of pregnancy, including a distended abdomen, intermittent “pulsating” bilateral lower abdominal cramps, and sensations of fetal movement. In addition, she endorsed amenorrhea for the past year, except for some “mild spotting” three weeks previously. Convinced that her two recent pregnancy tests were “false negatives” and frustrated that members of the treatment team did not believe she was pregnant, she threatened to sue the hospital for failing to provide obstetric care. The patient lamented that “you all think I'm crazy, but I'm actually pregnant.” At this time, she displayed an intensifying religious preoccupation and stated that she was able to communicate with angels and “see Jesus.” She proclaimed that she herself was a prophet who could interpret the “auras” of hospital staff.\n\nThe patient agreed to a pelvic exam, which revealed a distended, nontender abdomen. The uterus was nongravid. The patient received acetaminophen and heating pads, and we ordered a transabdominal ultrasound to better assess the etiology of her abdominal pain and in the hopes of resolving her condition via additional evidence of nonpregnancy. At this time, the patient began to refuse all previously prescribed medications because she believed these would harm her “baby.” She did, however, agree to begin fluphenazine elixir, which we prescribed to address worsening psychosis.\n\nWhen she arrived in the ultrasound suite, the patient offered the radiology technologist four million dollars “if you get this baby right.” She became euphoric while viewing the ultrasound monitor, exclaiming “That's a head, and that's a penis!” Her speech was pressured, and she perseverated on religious themes, requesting that all non-Christian staff leave the suite and instructing staff to “resist the Devil and he will flee from you!” She also demonstrated sexual preoccupation, recalling an experience in which she had “danced after I had sex” and exclaiming about the size of her “baby's penis,” predicting that he would be “sexy like his daddy.” After the procedure, the patient happily told fellow patients that she would soon deliver another child. She said, “I have been having contractions for 19 hr. When the results come back and they find out I am not crazy, they will finally send me to maternity.”\n\nAn on-call psychiatry resident presented the radiology report to the patient on hospital Day 20. She emphatically refuted the report, articulating a persecutory delusion of a conspiracy waged against her by the treatment team. She stated that the radiologist must have been “paid off” to switch her ultrasound with that of another patient. She continued to refuse medications that she felt might harm her “baby”; however, she agreed to an increase in her dose of fluphenazine. Following this dose increase, her affect remained labile, with frequent swings between euphoria and irritability, but she ceased making comments indicative of religious and sexual preoccupation. As our hospital is a short-term care facility, we decided to refer the patient to a higher level of care facility. On the day of her discharge, the patient told a nurse that “I don't think I'm pregnant anymore; it's all the shit I have inside me,” referring to her constipated bowels.",

         "The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a psychiatric history of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), major depressive disorder (MDD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), dyssomnia, tobacco use disorder, and alcohol use disorder in remission. Her tobacco use disorder began at age 22, and she smoked two packs of cigarettes daily. At age 46, she decreased her tobacco use to smoking one and a half packs of cigarettes daily. Two years later, she further decreased her tobacco use to smoking one pack of cigarettes daily.\n\nHer alcohol use disorder began at age 38, and she drank a pint (473 mL) of hard liquor daily. At age 45, she decreased her alcohol use to half a pint (236.5 mL) of hard liquor daily. The following year, she decreased her alcohol use to only weekends. Two years later, she used alcohol very occasionally. At age 49, her husband passed, and her alcohol use increased to a fifth (750 mL) of gin daily. She was hospitalized twice that year for chronic pancreatitis and quit drinking after the second hospitalization.\n\nShe struggled with worsening GAD, MDD, and PTSD since age 39. At age 46, she was prescribed citalopram but did not tolerate it. At age 49, she began regularly seeing outpatient psychiatry. She was prescribed sertraline and prazosin. A few months later, her MDD and PTSD symptoms significantly improved. However, her GAD worsened, and she had more frequent exacerbations. Her sertraline and prazosin dosages were increased. She was also prescribed hydroxyzine but did not tolerate it. Additionally, she received grief therapy as recommended. Her MDD and PTSD symptoms improved significantly more, but her GAD continued to be uncontrolled. Intermittently, she would be out of her medications, and her MDD and GAD would worsen. Her PTSD was stable, even when out of medication.\n\nAlso, the patient was prescribed melatonin for her dyssomnia at age 50. Her dyssomnia was uncontrolled despite increasing the melatonin dosage. She did not tolerate trazodone. The patient was then lost to follow-up with outpatient psychiatry for 2 years and returned at age 53. Since then, she has had regular follow-up appointments with outpatient psychiatry.\n\nWhen she returned to outpatient psychiatry at age 53, she had been off of all psychiatric medications. Her MDD was partially stable. Her PTSD was stable. Her GAD and dyssomnia were uncontrolled. She had resumed drinking small amounts of alcohol on occasion, about once a month, and she continued to smoke one pack of cigarettes daily. Her sertraline was resumed, and she was started on zolpidem. Her dyssomnia improved with zolpidem. Eventually, her sertraline was switched to paroxetine. After trialing multiple medications, she was started on diazepam for a short period for her uncontrolled anxiety. Psychotherapy was also recommended, but she did not take part in it. In April 2020, at age 55, her outpatient psychiatry appointments were converted from in-person to telehealth due to COVID-19 health regulations.\n\nAt age 49, the patient first noted fatigue and poor memory. At a follow-up appointment a few months later, she continued to report poor memory. A year later, she reported worsening memory, resulting in losing her keys and forgetting important dates. After that, she did not report fatigue or memory concerns for several years.\n\nIn August 2021, at age 56, the patient had mild COVID-19, which did not require hospitalization. Since then, for a period of over 1.5 years, she has reported persistent symptoms associated with LC-19. At her following appointment in December 2021, she noted fatigue, breathlessness, ageusia, poor appetite, weight loss, and “not feeling right.” In January 2022, she also reported poor memory, increased confusion, and being easily distracted. She was concerned she had an unnoticed stroke that was causing these symptoms. In February 2022, these symptoms persisted, and she reported left-side weakness. In April 2022, she also reported anosmia, “brain fog,” and feeling disorganized. She stated she could not describe her cognitive symptoms with words. In August 2022, she also reported generalized weakness, loss of balance, dizziness, body temperature changes, and increased disorganization. She stated she couldn't go to walk-in psychotherapy due to her disorganization.\n\nAt this time, she also began experiencing significant impairments in her daily functioning. She reported difficulties with instrumental activities of daily living, such as cooking. In September 2022, she also reported trouble with word finding. In October 2022, she also reported concern regarding her sensation of touch and vision. She reported that things felt different, and she thought her vision “easily missed things.” For example, she would not have initially seen a trash bag and would suddenly notice it was there. In January 2023, she also expressed feeling unable to drive, although once she was in the car, she could complete the task. In March 2023, she noted not being able to feel her left hand and believed she may have had a stroke to cause this. Other than fatigue and difficulty with memory, the patient did not express any of these symptoms or concerns prior to August 2021.\n\nHer social isolation, due to her symptoms, further exacerbated her distress. She reported excessive anxiety regarding the uncertain etiology of her symptoms. She frequently expressed concern that her physicians were not doing enough to diagnose and treat her. She requested a comprehensive work-up and hospital admission. She did not meet the criteria for hospital admission and was not admitted.",

For the past 2 years, he has used alcohol, cocaine, and medical substance (Lyrica and other medications). He has a history of social anxiety with biological symptoms, which are unresponsive to medication. He expressed low self esteem and feelings of worthlessness. He was pessimistic about the future, saying, “I don't see anything ahead for me.” He described a passive death wish, but denied having any active suicidal thoughts. He described feeling fast heartbeats, blushing, trembling, sweating, trouble catching his breath, dizziness, and panic complaints, especially when talking to people and women in specific. He also described being unable to carry out a conversation with others, feelings of being watched and laughed at, and believing that he is ugly looking. He described having these complaints since adolescence. The patient has been an addict for the past 2 years. He started with Marijuana and alcohol, and then he tried several medical drugs.\nThe patient talked about various upsetting memories of instances that took place during his childhood and up to his late teenage years. This included memories, such as not being given a choice or participating in decision making, his father's absence from the house due to travel, followed by the discovery of his marriage to another woman and the presence of children. His family's upbringing style is firm, authoritarian on the part of the mother, and permissive on the part of the father.",
