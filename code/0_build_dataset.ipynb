         "A 36-year-old woman, presented with apathy and food refusal. The patient is described by her family as highly emotional and sensitive. The episode started 2 months prior, with rapidly progressive tendencies towards isolation, irritability, and increased religious concerns. The symptoms progressed into statements of hopelessness and self-depreciation, along with a refusal to eat. As the symptoms progressed, the family noticed a marked weight loss of 15 kg per month (15% of initial weight) as well as episodes of vomiting resistant to symptomatic treatment. The initial clinical evaluation revealed signs of extracellular dehydration, a BMI of 18 kg/m2, and a total functional impotence. The psychiatric examination revealed an alert, yet apathetic patient who remained in bed, had difficulty with social interactions, emotional numbness, irritability, and anxiety. She expressed delusional thoughts of hopelessness, punishment, and suicidal ideation.\n\nThe patient was admitted to a psychiatric department, and upon the reintroduction of oral nutrition, she reported abdominal pain, diarrhoea, tachypnoea, along with low oxygen levels. Biochemical analysis showed elevated blood sugar levels, low potassium, phosphate, and magnesium levels. Inappropriate refeeding syndrome (IRS) was diagnosed, and the patient was transferred to an intensive care unit for 4 days, where she received parenteral nutrition and vitamin supplementation (Vit B1, Vit B9, Vit D, and Vit E). The patient was then readmitted to the psychiatry department.",

         "A black male in his early 20s with a remote history of depression as an adolescent and current cannabis use presented following an assault while incarcerated. He was found unconscious with mental status changes and brought to the hospital. Initial examination and work-up revealed right-sided periorbital edema and ecchymosis. The patient was arousable to noxious stimuli but would quickly return to sleep and was not interactive during multiple examination attempts. The emergency department staff believed there was a volitional component to his lack of participation in the exam, as he would push away from providers as they examined him or lie unresponsive. At one point, the patient was able to ambulate briefly while in the emergency department (although he ran into several objects) and tolerated an oral intake challenge with juice. Over the course of 5 days, the patient was returned to the emergency department by the facility four more times due to concerns that his mental status was not improving. The facility reported the patient was unable to attend to his ADLs. He was seen to be withdrawn, not eating or drinking, and toileting on himself or the floor. Additionally, guards (as he was incarcerated for part of his hospital admission) reported that he would occasionally speak to family members and staff. However, when he was offered paperwork to sign himself out of jail with an ankle monitor, he only gazed at the officer without speaking.\n\nUrine toxicology was positive for THC and a negative blood alcohol level. He was found to have ketones consistent with starvation ketosis. Lumbar puncture revealed CSF cell count with six total nucleated cells present, <2,000 RBC, 54 mg/dL glucose, and 39 mg/dL protein. Meningitis/encephalitis panel for 14 common viral and bacterial pathogens and antibody testing for West Nile Virus was negative. CT of the head showed no fractures of the face/vertebra and was negative for other acute findings. EEG was read as consistent with a normal drowsy state. MRI of the brain, both with and without contrast, showed a cerebellar developmental venous anomaly but no acute findings. A neurology consult was obtained. His neurologic exam was noted to be variable, with poor participation despite repeated prompting, making full examination difficult. He responded to pain equally in all extremities, demonstrated no abnormal movements, had 2+ reflexes symmetrically, and normal pupillary response. Neurology ultimately felt that his LP, MRI, and EEG were unremarkable, and his symptomatology could be explained by postconcussive symptoms.\n\nOnce the patient was admitted, he was initially treated with a trial of Modafinil for suspected postconcussive syndrome, to which there was no response. On Day 6 of his hospitalization, when the psychiatric consultation service reconsidered his disordered behavior, psychomotor retardation, and speech with consideration for the presence of catatonia, the question of “volitional” inactivity took on a new meaning. There were numerous catatonia signs present to variable degrees: mutism, decreased oral intake, negativism, withdrawal, and decreased spontaneous movement. No automatic obedience, ambitendency, or rigidity was appreciated. ",

         "In October 2023, a 24-year-old unemployed male presented to the Antalya Ataturk State Hospital outpatient substance addiction treatment clinic for IV BN misuse. He was suffering from pain and restlessness secondary to cessation of BN. In the last 3 months, when he reduced or ceased BN, symptoms, such as restlessness, lacrimation, back and extremity pain, cramps, and insomnia, started to appear within hours. He felt dysphoric and exhausted when he did not use BN. Due to escalating BN use, he has begun to suspect dependency on the medication. The patient had no history of any medical illness in the past.\n\nOn the mental status examination, the patient appeared to be tense. Her speech was normal. He was dysphoric. Psychomotor activity was increased, consistent with opiate withdrawal. The content of his thoughts was dominated by an inability to move away from substance use and pessimistic thoughts associated with it. He had no signs of delusion or hallucinations. His attention was prone to be easily distracted.\n\nThroughout his adolescence, there were no symptoms suggestive of borderline personality traits or conduct disorder. His substance use history began at the age of 15 with experimenting with marijuana, introduced by friends out of curiosity. He described feeling euphoria and numbness, using one joint 2–3 times a week. At 18, witnessing someone using heroin in a social setting led him to try it. He had smoked heroin it for a month. Switching to IV use after a friend claimed it provided a better “high,” he continued with 1–2 g of IV heroin daily for the next 5 years (except in his mandatory military service period at 19 for 6 months). He also occasionally used crack cocaine (2 or 3 times a week) in combination with heroin. Infrequently, he encountered and used methamphetamine less than once a month.\n\nAbout 14 months ago, he was referred to an outpatient substance addiction treatment clinic in another city. An oral BN treatment was initiated at 8 mg daily (2 mg, 4 times a day). After using one or two tablets, he later transitioned to IV use following a friend's suggestion. While he initially described a sense of relaxation and elevation similar to heroin use, recent injections have been solely to alleviate withdrawal symptoms—especially pain. He started with a single IV usage of 2 mg. Over the past 3–4 months, his IV BN use reached 12–16 mg daily with a frequency of four to five injections per day due to tolerance. To mitigate withdrawal symptoms, such as pain, fatigue, restlessness, hot flashes, and insomnia, when using less or abstaining from BN, he started using pregabaline 6 months ago. Subsequently, there was an increase in pregabalin misuse, reaching 3,000 mg daily during this period when he ceased BN use. Within the last month prior to admission, he had not used any pregabaline. Due to conflicts in the marriage and financial difficulties, he separated from his wife. For the past 5 months, he has been living with his parents.",

         "A 12-year-old male with no specific birth or medical history became concerned about lower abdominal distention and began reducing his food intake 3 months prior to consultation. He exercised obsessively according to his food intake. Although he was considerably losing weight, he commented that his belly was fat and did not want it to get any fatter. Body image disturbances and anxiety regarding being overweight were observed. During his initial consultation, he was very lean, with a body mass index (BMI) of 11.5 kg/m2. He also had sinus bradycardia with a heart rate of approximately 40 beats/min. We attempted to improve his weight with enteral nutritional supplements while identifying underlying diseases by head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and abdominal ultrasound. However, he became disoriented and was emergently hospitalized 7 days after his first visit. On admission, he was 145 cm tall, weighed 20.9 kg (BMI: 9.9 kg/m2), and presented with impaired consciousness with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) E3V4M6, bradycardia with a heart rate of about 40 beats/min, and slow breathing with a respiratory rate of about 10 cycles/min. Blood gas analysis and blood test revealed hypercapnia, hypoglycemia, and elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and transaminases. His movements were slow but not paralytic and his cranial nerves were normal. ",

In the 6 days prior to admission, the patient exhibited notable behavioral changes, including nihilistic comments and explicit thoughts of self-harm that were accompanied by poor sleep, depressive mood, and nonspecific visual hallucinations. He was brought into the emergency department for these thoughts and depressed mood he was incidentally found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. He was admitted to the medical floor for isolation.\n\nWhile on the medical floor, initial workup included a negative urine drug screening and an unremarkable cranial CT scan. EEG was also negative. The patient met the criteria for MDD with psychotic features. Evaluation at this time was remarkable for marked personal hygiene neglect, social withdrawal, sadness of mood, diminished interest in almost all activities, anhedonia, ideas of worthlessness, hopelessness, and guilt. He also endorsed poor sleep and no appetite despite refusing to eat since being admitted to the hospital. Patient also endorsed experiencing some anxiety secondary to his nihilism which presented as a belief that he was already dead and that his insides were poisonous to others. This belief was so strong that the patient was afraid to urinate or defecate thinking he would kill the entire hospital by doing so.

         "A 36-year-old woman, presented with apathy and food refusal. The patient is described by her family as highly emotional and sensitive. The episode started 2 months prior, with rapidly progressive tendencies towards isolation, irritability, and increased religious concerns. The symptoms progressed into statements of hopelessness and self-depreciation, along with a refusal to eat. As the symptoms progressed, the family noticed a marked weight loss of 15 kg per month (15% of initial weight) as well as episodes of vomiting resistant to symptomatic treatment. The initial clinical evaluation revealed signs of extracellular dehydration, a BMI of 18 kg/m2, and a total functional impotence. The psychiatric examination revealed an alert, yet apathetic patient who remained in bed, had difficulty with social interactions, emotional numbness, irritability, and anxiety. She expressed delusional thoughts of hopelessness, punishment, and suicidal ideation.\n\nThe patient was admitted to a psychiatric department, and upon the reintroduction of oral nutrition, she reported abdominal pain, diarrhoea, tachypnoea, along with low oxygen levels. Biochemical analysis showed elevated blood sugar levels, low potassium, phosphate, and magnesium levels. Inappropriate refeeding syndrome (IRS) was diagnosed, and the patient was transferred to an intensive care unit for 4 days, where she received parenteral nutrition and vitamin supplementation (Vit B1, Vit B9, Vit D, and Vit E). The patient was then readmitted to the psychiatry department.",

         "A black male in his early 20s with a remote history of depression as an adolescent and current cannabis use presented following an assault while incarcerated. He was found unconscious with mental status changes and brought to the hospital. Initial examination and work-up revealed right-sided periorbital edema and ecchymosis. The patient was arousable to noxious stimuli but would quickly return to sleep and was not interactive during multiple examination attempts. The emergency department staff believed there was a volitional component to his lack of participation in the exam, as he would push away from providers as they examined him or lie unresponsive. At one point, the patient was able to ambulate briefly while in the emergency department (although he ran into several objects) and tolerated an oral intake challenge with juice. Over the course of 5 days, the patient was returned to the emergency department by the facility four more times due to concerns that his mental status was not improving. The facility reported the patient was unable to attend to his ADLs. He was seen to be withdrawn, not eating or drinking, and toileting on himself or the floor. Additionally, guards (as he was incarcerated for part of his hospital admission) reported that he would occasionally speak to family members and staff. However, when he was offered paperwork to sign himself out of jail with an ankle monitor, he only gazed at the officer without speaking.\n\nUrine toxicology was positive for THC and a negative blood alcohol level. He was found to have ketones consistent with starvation ketosis. Lumbar puncture revealed CSF cell count with six total nucleated cells present, <2,000 RBC, 54 mg/dL glucose, and 39 mg/dL protein. Meningitis/encephalitis panel for 14 common viral and bacterial pathogens and antibody testing for West Nile Virus was negative. CT of the head showed no fractures of the face/vertebra and was negative for other acute findings. EEG was read as consistent with a normal drowsy state. MRI of the brain, both with and without contrast, showed a cerebellar developmental venous anomaly but no acute findings. A neurology consult was obtained. His neurologic exam was noted to be variable, with poor participation despite repeated prompting, making full examination difficult. He responded to pain equally in all extremities, demonstrated no abnormal movements, had 2+ reflexes symmetrically, and normal pupillary response. Neurology ultimately felt that his LP, MRI, and EEG were unremarkable, and his symptomatology could be explained by postconcussive symptoms.\n\nOnce the patient was admitted, he was initially treated with a trial of Modafinil for suspected postconcussive syndrome, to which there was no response. On Day 6 of his hospitalization, when the psychiatric consultation service reconsidered his disordered behavior, psychomotor retardation, and speech with consideration for the presence of catatonia, the question of “volitional” inactivity took on a new meaning. There were numerous catatonia signs present to variable degrees: mutism, decreased oral intake, negativism, withdrawal, and decreased spontaneous movement. No automatic obedience, ambitendency, or rigidity was appreciated. ",

         "In October 2023, a 24-year-old unemployed male presented to the Antalya Ataturk State Hospital outpatient substance addiction treatment clinic for IV BN misuse. He was suffering from pain and restlessness secondary to cessation of BN. In the last 3 months, when he reduced or ceased BN, symptoms, such as restlessness, lacrimation, back and extremity pain, cramps, and insomnia, started to appear within hours. He felt dysphoric and exhausted when he did not use BN. Due to escalating BN use, he has begun to suspect dependency on the medication. The patient had no history of any medical illness in the past.\n\nOn the mental status examination, the patient appeared to be tense. Her speech was normal. He was dysphoric. Psychomotor activity was increased, consistent with opiate withdrawal. The content of his thoughts was dominated by an inability to move away from substance use and pessimistic thoughts associated with it. He had no signs of delusion or hallucinations. His attention was prone to be easily distracted.\n\nThroughout his adolescence, there were no symptoms suggestive of borderline personality traits or conduct disorder. His substance use history began at the age of 15 with experimenting with marijuana, introduced by friends out of curiosity. He described feeling euphoria and numbness, using one joint 2–3 times a week. At 18, witnessing someone using heroin in a social setting led him to try it. He had smoked heroin it for a month. Switching to IV use after a friend claimed it provided a better “high,” he continued with 1–2 g of IV heroin daily for the next 5 years (except in his mandatory military service period at 19 for 6 months). He also occasionally used crack cocaine (2 or 3 times a week) in combination with heroin. Infrequently, he encountered and used methamphetamine less than once a month.\n\nAbout 14 months ago, he was referred to an outpatient substance addiction treatment clinic in another city. An oral BN treatment was initiated at 8 mg daily (2 mg, 4 times a day). After using one or two tablets, he later transitioned to IV use following a friend's suggestion. While he initially described a sense of relaxation and elevation similar to heroin use, recent injections have been solely to alleviate withdrawal symptoms—especially pain. He started with a single IV usage of 2 mg. Over the past 3–4 months, his IV BN use reached 12–16 mg daily with a frequency of four to five injections per day due to tolerance. To mitigate withdrawal symptoms, such as pain, fatigue, restlessness, hot flashes, and insomnia, when using less or abstaining from BN, he started using pregabaline 6 months ago. Subsequently, there was an increase in pregabalin misuse, reaching 3,000 mg daily during this period when he ceased BN use. Within the last month prior to admission, he had not used any pregabaline. Due to conflicts in the marriage and financial difficulties, he separated from his wife. For the past 5 months, he has been living with his parents.",

         "A 12-year-old male with no specific birth or medical history became concerned about lower abdominal distention and began reducing his food intake 3 months prior to consultation. He exercised obsessively according to his food intake. Although he was considerably losing weight, he commented that his belly was fat and did not want it to get any fatter. Body image disturbances and anxiety regarding being overweight were observed. During his initial consultation, he was very lean, with a body mass index (BMI) of 11.5 kg/m2. He also had sinus bradycardia with a heart rate of approximately 40 beats/min. We attempted to improve his weight with enteral nutritional supplements while identifying underlying diseases by head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and abdominal ultrasound. However, he became disoriented and was emergently hospitalized 7 days after his first visit. On admission, he was 145 cm tall, weighed 20.9 kg (BMI: 9.9 kg/m2), and presented with impaired consciousness with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) E3V4M6, bradycardia with a heart rate of about 40 beats/min, and slow breathing with a respiratory rate of about 10 cycles/min. Blood gas analysis and blood test revealed hypercapnia, hypoglycemia, and elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and transaminases. His movements were slow but not paralytic and his cranial nerves were normal. ",

He was brought into the emergency department for these thoughts and depressed mood he was incidentally found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. He was admitted to the medical floor for isolation.\n\nWhile on the medical floor, initial workup included a negative urine drug screening and an unremarkable cranial CT scan. EEG was also negative. The patient met the criteria for MDD with psychotic features. Evaluation at this time was remarkable for marked personal hygiene neglect, social withdrawal, sadness of mood, diminished interest in almost all activities, anhedonia, ideas of worthlessness, hopelessness, and guilt. He also endorsed poor sleep and no appetite despite refusing to eat since being admitted to the hospital. Patient also endorsed experiencing some anxiety secondary to his nihilism which presented as a belief that he was already dead and that his insides were poisonous to others. This belief was so strong that the patient was afraid to urinate or defecate thinking he would kill the entire hospital by doing so.

         "Ashley, age 17, was referred for a diagnostic reevaluation after having carried diagnoses of autism and intellectual disability for almost all of her life. She was recently found to have Kleefstra syndrome, and the family wanted to reconfirm the earlier diagnoses and assess the genetic risk to the future children of her older sisters.\n\nAt the time of the reevaluation, Ashley was attending a special school with a focus on functional skills. She was able to dress herself, but she was not able to shower independently or be left alone in the house. She was able to decode (e.g., read words) and spell at a second-grade level but understood little of what she read. Changes to her schedule and heightened functional expectations tended to make her irritable. When upset, Ashley would often hurt herself (e.g., biting her wrist) and others (e.g., pinching and hair pulling).\n\nIn formal testing done at the time of the reevaluation, Ashley had a nonverbal IQ of 39 and a verbal IQ of 23, with a full scale IQ of 31. Her adaptive scores were somewhat higher, with an overall score of 42 (with 100 as average).\n\nBy history, Ashley first received services at age 9 months after her parents noticed significant motor delays. She walked at 20 months and was toilet trained at 5 years. She spoke her first word at age 6. She received a diagnosis of developmental delay at age 3 and of autism, obesity, and static encephalopathy at age 4. An early evaluation noted possible facial dysmorphology; genetic tests at that time were noncontributory.\n\nHer parents indicated that Ashley knew hundreds of single words and many simple phrases. She had long been very interested in license plates and would draw them for hours. Her strongest skill was memory, and she could draw precise representations of license plates from different states. Ashley had always been very attached to her parents and sisters, and although affectionate toward babies, she showed minimal interest in other teenagers.\n\nAshley’s family history was pertinent for a father with dyslexia, a paternal uncle with epilepsy, and a maternal male cousin with possible “Asperger’s syndrome.” Her siblings, both sisters, were in college and doing well.\n\nOn examination, Ashley was an overweight young woman who made inconsistent eye contact but often peered out the corner of her eye. She had a beautiful smile and would sometimes laugh to herself, but most of the time her facial expressions were subdued. She did not initiate joint attention by trying to catch another person’s eyes. She frequently ignored what others would say to her. To request a preferred object (e.g., a shiny magazine), Ashley would rock from foot to foot and point. When offered an object (e.g., a small decorated box), she brought it to her nose and lips for inspection. Ashley spoke in a high-pitched voice with unusual intonation. During the interview, she used multiple words and a few short phrases that were somewhat rote but communicative, such as “I want to clean up,” and “Do you have a van?”\n\nIn the months prior to the evaluation, Ashley’s parents noticed that she had become increasingly apathetic. A medical evaluation concluded that urinary tract infections were the most likely cause for her symptoms, but antibiotics seemed only to make her more listless. Further medical evaluation led to more extensive genetic testing, and Ashley was diagnosed with Kleefstra syndrome, a rare genetic defect associated with multiple medical problems, including intellectual developmental disorder. The parents said they were also tested and found to “be negative.”\n\nThe parents specifically wanted to know whether the genetic testing results affected Ashley’s long-standing diagnoses and access to future services. Furthermore, they wanted to know whether their other two daughters should get tested for their risk of carrying genes for autism, intellectual disability, and/or Kleefstra syndrome.",
         "In regard to diagnosis, Ashley’s cognitive testing and limited everyday adaptive skills are consistent with intellectual developmental disorder, a term in DSM-5-TR that is equivalent to “intellectual disability,” which had previously been the preferred term. In addition, Ashley manifests two symptom clusters that are core to the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD): 1) deficits in social communication and 2) restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. Ashley also fulfills the DSM-5-TR ASD requirement of having had symptoms in the early developmental period and a history of significant impairment. A fifth requirement for ASD is that the disturbances are not better explained by intellectual developmental disorder, which is a more complicated question in Ashley’s case.\n\nFor many years, clinicians and researchers have debated the boundary between ASD and intellectual developmental disorders. As IQ decreases, the proportion of children and adults who meet criteria for ASD increases. Most individuals with IQs below 30 have ASD as well as intellectual developmental disorder.\n\nFor Ashley to meet DSM-5-TR criteria for both ASD and intellectual developmental disorder, the specific deficits and behaviors associated with ASD must be greater than what would ordinarily be seen in people with her overall intellectual development. In other words, if her deficits were due solely to limited intellectual abilities, she would be expected to have the social and play skills of a typical 3- to 4-year-old child. Ashley’s social interaction is not at all like that of a typical preschooler, however, and never has been. She has limited facial expressions, poor eye contact, and minimal interest in peers. In comparison with her “mental age,” Ashley demonstrates significant restriction in both her range of interests and her understanding of basic human emotions. Furthermore, she manifests behaviors that are not seen commonly at any age.\n\nThe heterogeneity of autism has led to significant conflict. Some argue, for example, that children with very severe intellectual developmental disorder should be excluded from the diagnosis of ASD. Others argue that more intellectually able children with ASD should be placed into their own category, Asperger syndrome. Research does not support either of these distinctions. For example, studies indicate that children with ASD symptoms and severe intellectual developmental disorder often have siblings with ASD and stronger intellectual abilities. Much remains to be known about ASD, but IQ does not appear to be the key distinguishing factor.\n\nFrom a pragmatic perspective, the critical factor is whether an ASD diagnosis offers information that helps guide treatment and the availability of services. For Ashley, the ASD diagnosis encourages a focus on helping to support her in social skills and less structured environments. It calls attention to differences in her motivation and in her need for structure. The ASD diagnosis also underlines the importance of looking carefully for Ashley’s cognitive strengths (e.g., rote memory and visual representation) and weaknesses (e.g., comprehension, social interaction, and an ability to adapt to change). All of these may play a large role in her efforts to live as independently as possible.\n\nAshley’s parents are also concerned about the impact of the recent genetic testing results on Ashley’s treatment and on her sisters’ family planning. Hundreds of individual genes may play a role in the complex neurological issues involved in autism, but most cases of ASD lack a clear cause. Ashley’s genetic condition, Kleefstra syndrome, is reliably associated with both intellectual developmental disorder and ASD symptoms. When a genetic or medical condition or environmental factor appears to be implicated, it is listed as a specifier, but the ASD diagnosis is not otherwise affected.\n\nKnowledge of the genetic cause for Ashley’s intellectual developmental disorder and ASD is important for several reasons. It reminds her physicians to look for medical comorbidities that are common in Kleefstra syndrome, such as problems with the heart and kidneys (possibly leading, for example, to her recurrent urinary tract infections). Knowledge of the genetic cause also expands informational resources by connecting Ashley’s family to other families that are affected by this rare syndrome.\n\nA particularly important aspect of this new genetic diagnosis is its effect on Ashley’s sisters. In almost all reported cases, Kleefstra syndrome has occurred de novo, meaning that there is an extremely low likelihood that anyone else in her family has any abnormality in the affected gene region. On rare occasions, an unaffected parent has a chromosomal translocation or mosaicism that leads to the syndrome, but the fact that Ashley’s parents were found to “be negative” implies they are not genetic carriers. Although this is not necessarily true for situations involving other autism-related genetic disorders, this particular genetic diagnosis in Ashley likely indicates that her sisters are not at greatly increased risk for having children with ASD, although they are not protected from ordinary risk. Such information can be very reassuring and useful to Ashley’s sisters. The fact remains that although genetics undoubtedly plays a large role in ASD and intellectual developmental disorders, most cases cannot be reliably predicted, and diagnosis is made through ongoing, longitudinal observation during childhood.",

         "Brandon was a 12-year-old boy brought in by his mother for psychiatric evaluation for temper tantrums that seemed to be contributing to declining school performance. The mother became emotional as she reported that things had always been difficult but had become worse after Brandon entered middle school. Shortly after starting middle school, Brandon had started complaining of stomachaches on school-day mornings and was often reluctant to go to school.\n\nBrandon’s sixth-grade teachers reported that he was academically capable but that he had little ability to make friends. He seemed to mistrust the intentions of classmates who tried to be nice to him but attempted to befriend others who laughingly feigned interest in the toy cars and trucks that he brought to school. The teachers noted that he often cried and rarely spoke in class. In recent months, multiple teachers had heard him screaming at other boys, generally in the hallway but sometimes in the middle of class. The teachers had not identified a cause but generally had not disciplined Brandon because they assumed he was responding to provocation. He was embarrassed about these outbursts and did not want to go to swim practice because he did not want his swim friends to ask why he’d had an outburst at school.\n\nWhen interviewed alone, Brandon responded with nonspontaneous mumbles when asked questions about school, classmates, and his family. When the examiner asked if he was interested in toy cars, however, Brandon lit up. He pulled several cars, trucks, and airplanes from his backpack and, while not making good eye contact, did talk at length about vehicles, using their apparently accurate names (e.g., front-end loader, B-52, Jaguar). When asked again about school, Brandon pulled out his cell phone and showed a string of text messages: “dumbo!!!!” “mr stutter”; “LoSeR”; “freak!”; “EVERYBODY HATES YOU.” While the examiner read the long string of texts that Brandon had saved but apparently not previously revealed, Brandon added that other boys would whisper “bad words” to him in class and then scream in his ears in the hall. “And I hate loud noises.” He also told the examiner that he sometimes wished that he had never been born.\n\nDevelopmentally, Brandon spoke his first word at age 11 months and began to use short sentences by age 3. He had always been very focused on trucks, cars, and trains. According to his mother, he had always been “very shy” and had never had a best friend. As he has gotten older, it has become more apparent that he struggles with jokes and typical young adolescent banter because “he takes things so literally.” Brandon’s mother had long seen this behavior as “a little odd” but added that it was not much different from that of Brandon’s father, a successful attorney, who had similarly focused interests. Both of them were “sticklers for routine” who “lacked a sense of humor.” Brandon’s mother noted that he made efforts to conceal his interest in trucks, cars, and trains outside of the home but would eagerly speak about them when encouraged. Brandon has shared with his mother that he tries to appear “normal” when interacting with peers at school, which is exhausting. He often feels nervous around peers and generally tries to avoid socializing.\n\nOn examination, Brandon was shy and generally nonspontaneous. He made below-average eye contact. His speech was coherent and goal directed. At times, Brandon stumbled over his words, paused excessively, and sometimes rapidly repeated words or parts of words. Brandon said he felt okay but added that he was scared of school, particularly when around other children. He appeared sad, brightening only when discussing his toy cars. He denied current suicidal thoughts or plans as well as homicidality. He denied psychotic symptoms. He was cognitively intact.",
         "Brandon presents with symptoms consistent with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). DSM-5 ASD incorporates several previously separate disorders, namely DSM-IV autistic disorder (autism), Asperger’s disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. ASD is characterized by two main symptom domains: social communication deficits and a fixated set of interests and repetitive behaviors.\n\nIt is evident that Brandon has considerable difficulty in his peer social interactions. He is unable to form friendships, does not engage in interactive play, and struggles with reading social cues. People with ASD typically find it challenging to correctly interpret the relevance of facial expressions, body language, and other nonverbal behaviors. He is humorless and “takes things so literally.” These symptoms meet the ASD criteria for social communication deficits.\n\nIn regard to the second ASD symptom domain, Brandon has fixated interests and repetitive behaviors that cause significant distress. He seems interested in cars and trains, has little interest in anything else, and has limited insight that other children might not share his enthusiasms. He requires “sameness,” with distress arising if his routine is altered. Brandon meets both of the primary symptomatic criteria, therefore, for DSM-5 ASD.\n\nBrandon also stumbles over words, pauses excessively, and repeats words or parts of words. These symptoms are consistent with stuttering, which is classified as one of the DSM-5 communication disorders, namely childhood-onset fluency disorder. Typically persistent and characterized by frequent repetitions or prolongations of sounds, broken words, pauses in speech, and circumlocutions, childhood-onset fluency disorder may result in significant social, academic, and occupational dysfunction.\n\nOther DSM-5 communication disorders include difficulties in speech production (speech sound disorder), difficulty in use of spoken and written language (language disorder), and difficulty in the social uses of verbal and nonverbal communication (social [pragmatic] communication disorder). Although these difficulties are not noted in the case report, Brandon should be evaluated for each of these, because language impairments are so commonly part of ASD that they are listed as specifiers of ASD rather than as separate, comorbid diagnoses.\n\nMany individuals with ASD have comorbid anxiety symptoms. The most common anxiety disorders in ASD are specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, and agoraphobia. In Brandon’s case, signs that suggest he should be further evaluated for an anxiety disorder include his stomachaches, avoidance of social activities, and frequent feelings of embarrassment in social situations. The 25-item Parent-Rated Anxiety Scale for ASD (PRAS-ASD) is a reliable and valid scale for measuring anxiety in youth with ASD.\n\nPrior to DSM-5, Brandon would have met criteria for Asperger’s disorder, which identified a cluster of individuals with core autism features (social deficits and fixated interests) and normal intelligence. Perhaps because he shared autism spectrum symptoms with his own father, however, Brandon was viewed as “a little odd” but without problems that merited specific clinical attention. The lack of a diagnosis contributed to Brandon’s having become the defenseless target of malicious bullying, a not uncommon finding in people with ASD.\n\nBrandon has experienced passive suicidal thoughts. Individuals with ASD are at elevated risk for suicidal thoughts and completed suicide, and it will be important for Brandon to periodically receive careful safety assessments in the future. Without appropriate interventions for both his core ASD symptoms and his stuttering, Brandon is at serious risk for ongoing psychological trauma and academic derailment.\n\nBrandon’s ongoing passion for a single subject (in his case, trucks, cars, and trains) is typical for children with ASD. Brandon is sensitive to the fact that his peers no longer share his passion (if they ever did), so he hides his interest. Similarly, he wants to skip swim practice because of his earlier outburst at school. In both cases, his embarrassment is painful, but there are positives as well: Brandon is aware that his behaviors are unusual, and he wants to have friends; his insight and desire to socialize are positive prognostic factors and suggest that appropriate treatment interventions may be beneficial.",

         "Carlos was a 19-year-old Hispanic college student in his freshman year at a public university in a large city. He was referred by his guidance counselor to the hospital’s outpatient psychiatric clinic for help with academic difficulties. Since starting college 6 months earlier, he had done poorly on tests and been unable to manage his study schedule. His worries that he was going to flunk out of college were leading to anxiety, insomnia, poor concentration, and a general sense of hopelessness. After a particularly tough week, he told his family that he thought he should quit. His mother accompanied him to the clinic that had previously helped both Carlos and his younger brother. The mother specifically wondered whether Carlos’s “ADHD” might be causing his problems, or whether he had outgrown it.\n\nCarlos had been seen at the same clinic when he was age 9, at which time he had been diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), predominantly combined type. Notes from that clinical evaluation indicated that Carlos had been in trouble at school for not following instructions, not completing homework, getting out of his seat, losing things, not waiting his turn, and not listening. He had trouble concentrating except in regard to video games, which he “could play for hours.” Carlos had apparently been slow to talk, but his birth and developmental histories were otherwise normal. He repeated first grade because of behavioral immaturity and difficulty learning to read. The ease with which Carlos learned English, his second language, was not noted. His family had emigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic when he was 5 years old. The family was Catholic and attended church every Sunday. Both of his parents worked in maintenance and housekeeping at a local municipal hospital.\n\nDuring the evaluation when Carlos was age 9, a psychoeducational assessment by a clinical psychologist confirmed reading problems (particularly problems in reading fluency and comprehension). Carlos did not, however, meet the school board criteria for a learning disability, which required evidence of a 20-point discrepancy between IQ and achievement scores. Thus, he was not eligible for special education services. The evaluator had noted Carlos to be eager to do well and anxious about underperforming. His anxiety was thought to be a reaction to his school difficulties and his challenges in meeting the academic expectations of his family. Carlos’s pediatrician had recommended pharmacotherapy, but his parents did not want to pursue medication. They cited negative experiences with local youth who used diverted controlled substances and hung out “on the street.” Instead, his mother reported taking on an extra job to pay for tutors to help her son “with concentration and reading.” The eldest of four siblings, Carlos had done well with this intervention and was now the first member of his family to attend college.\n\nThe psychiatry trainee carefully reviewed Carlos’s academic history; his symptoms, including the course and severity of sadness, anxiety, insomnia, and hopelessness; and his social and developmental history. She obtained collateral history from his family and school records. She used the revised DSM-5-TR Core Cultural Formulation Interview for assistance in obtaining a better understanding of Carlos’s acculturation experiences, the family’s past feelings about the clinic’s recommendations, and what treatment interventions would be relevant and acceptable to Carlos and his family.\n\nThe psychiatry trainee learned that Carlos had a childhood history of “nervousness” identified by a neighborhood curandera (traditional healer) as ataque de nervios. The family had addressed this problem with supportive prayer and a traditional herbal tea. They had apparently not revealed this to the psychiatrist at the time, thinking he would find it irrelevant and not wishing to seem disrespectful of his authority. During these unrevealed episodes of acute anxiety, Carlos would experience trembling and agitation, palpitations, shortness of breath, dread of harm, and fear of separation from caregivers. Workup by the pediatrician had revealed no physiological cause.\n\nSince starting college, Carlos reported that he had frequently been unable to remain focused while reading and listening to lectures. He was easily sidetracked and therefore had difficulty handing in his written assignments on time. He complained of feeling restless, agitated, and worried. He described difficulty falling asleep, poor energy, and an inability to “have fun” like his peers. He reported that the depressive symptoms went “up and down” over the course of the week and possibly influenced his problems with concentration; it was hard for him to be certain. He denied substance use.\n\nCarlos said that he’d had some great teachers in high school who had understood him, helped him get the meaning of what he read, and allowed him to audiotape lectures and use other formats (e.g., videos, wikis, visual presentations) for final assignments. Without this support at college, he said he felt “lonely, stupid, a failure—unable to cope.”\n\nAlthough advised by his high school teacher to do so, Carlos had not registered with the university’s student disability services office. He preferred not to be seen as different from his peers and thought he should be able to get through college by himself.\n\nCarlos’s family history was positive for ADHD in a younger brother. A cousin was reported to have had “dyslexia” and had dropped out of a local community college after one semester. His social and developmental history revealed that he had been well liked by his cluster of friends throughout school. His group consisted of boys and girls and tended to consist of kids more interested in school than in sports. Carlos denied ever having dated or been sexually active, and he also denied having any significant interest in pursuing either of these activities.\n\nOn examination, Carlos was well-groomed, polite, and soft-spoken. He wore clean jeans, a T-shirt, and a hoodie that he kept pulling down over his face. He sat quietly and hunched over. He sighed a lot and rarely made eye contact with the clinician. He often tapped his fingers and shuffled in his seat but responded appropriately to questions. His command of English appeared strong, but he spoke with a slight Spanish accent. He often mumbled and mispronounced some multisyllabic words (e.g., he said “literalchure” instead of “literature” and “intimate” when he clearly meant “intimidate”). He denied any suicidal thoughts. He appeared motivated to do better. On a follow-up interview with the psychiatry trainee, Carlos asked whether the conversations were confidential. When informed that they were, he hesitantly admitted that he felt overwhelmed by new relationships with college peers. He indicated that “in my neighborhood growing up, everybody was Dominican, but in college, I’m the only Dominican.” He also quietly said that he thought he might “like guys rather than girls.” He revealed two recent episodes of panic “like when I was a kid” that had occurred during social situations. He declined to go into further detail.\n\nAfter these two initial sessions, the psychiatrist suggested extending the evaluation so that they could optimize a treatment strategy. She told Carlos that she wanted to better understand his mood and anxiety symptoms, as well as how he felt about being the first in his family to go to college (i.e., role transitions), and to talk a little more about his concerns about his sexual orientation. She also referred Carlos for updated psychoeducational testing. This psychoeducational reassessment confirmed that Carlos’s reading and writing abilities were substantially and quantifiably below those expected for his age. That report also concluded that these learning difficulties were not attributable to intellectual developmental disorder, uncorrected visual or auditory acuity, psychosocial adversity, or lack of proficiency in the language of academic instruction. The report concluded that Carlos had specific difficulties with reading fluency and comprehension as well as spelling and written expression.",
         "Carlos presents with a history of ADHD that was diagnosed in childhood. He also appears to have anxiety and panic attacks that recurred in college. His earlier anxiety/panic had not been previously identified by his pediatrician (although it had been diagnosed as ataque de nervios and treated by a traditional healer in their community). He also appears to have a new-onset major depressive episode, mild severity, in the context of stressors surrounding acculturation, transition to college, and uncertainty about his sexual orientation.\n\nWhen Carlos was first evaluated at age 9, DSM-IV criteria for ADHD required six of the nine symptoms listed in either of the two categories: inattention or hyperactivity-impulsivity (as well as an onset before age 12). He had been diagnosed as having the combined type of ADHD, indicating the specialty clinic had found at least six symptoms in each of these spheres.\n\nCarlos now presents at age 19, and the case report indicates that he may have five different inattentive symptoms and two symptoms related to hyperactivity-impulsivity. This seems to indicate a symptomatic improvement. Partial remission of ADHD is common with age, especially in regard to hyperactivity symptoms. Under DSM-IV, Carlos’s ADHD would be said to have remitted. DSM-5 has a lower threshold of five symptoms in either category, rather than six, so Carlos would continue to meet the symptomatic criteria for ADHD.\n\nCarlos’s anxiety and depression might actually be causing his inattention, however, and ADHD should not be diagnosed if an alternative explanation is more likely. Carlos does appear to have had ADHD as a child, but that earlier evaluation did not uncover the symptoms that were identified by a traditional healer as ataque de nervios.\n\nIn addition to trying to clarify the cause of his inattention (and whether he actually has ADHD), the ongoing assessment might also explore Carlos’s perspective on being the first in his family to attend college and on his identity as “the only Dominican on campus.” It would also be useful to tactfully explore issues related to sexual orientation. This might include his sexual feelings and fantasies, the triggers for his recent panic attacks, and his (and his family’s) views on homosexual behavior. The case report mentions that members of Carlos’s family are observant Catholics and that they sought out a traditional healer for Carlos’s ataque de nervios. It would be useful to better understand how Carlos and his family merge aspects of their Catholicism and traditional Afro-Caribbean religions; such an understanding might inform Carlos’s perspective on all of his concerns, including the anxiety, depression, and his “liking guys.”\n\nCarlos may well have mood and anxiety disorders in addition to ADHD. Academic problems are common in ADHD even in the absence of a specific learning disorder (SLD), although SLDs are also commonly comorbid with ADHD. Even before his repeat psychological testing, Carlos appeared to have multiple historical issues that increase the likelihood of an SLD. His speech was delayed in his first language, Spanish; his reading was slow in both Spanish and English; and he received (and thrived with) educational accommodations in high school. All of these suggest an SLD, as does his positive family history for learning disability.\n\nCarlos’s previous psychoeducational assessment failed to confirm a learning disorder because he did not meet the required discrepancy between IQ and achievement for diagnosis with an SLD. Based on an additional decade of evidence, DSM-5 eliminated this discrepancy criterion for SLD. This change has made it reasonable to refer older adolescent patients for reevaluation.\n\nThe repeat psychological testing indicates a moderately severe SLD. Because Carlos’s learning difficulties began when he was school age and continue to cause academic impairment, he meets the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for SLD. Documentation of both ADHD and SLD will enable Carlos to access academic accommodations that should allow him to more robustly pursue his college studies.",

         "Daphne, a 13-year-old in the ninth grade, was brought for a psychiatric evaluation because of academic and behavioral struggles. She had particular difficulty starting and completing schoolwork and following instructions, and she had received failing grades in math. When prompted to complete tasks, Daphne became argumentative and irritable. She had become increasingly resistant to attending school, asking to stay home with her mother. These difficulties had been evident since early childhood but had worsened significantly this year. Because Daphne had become increasingly distressed, her parents have been less insistent on making her do any activity that upsets her.\n\nPsychological testing indicated that Daphne had above-average intelligence, age-appropriate achievement in all subjects except math, and some difficulties in visuospatial skills. The test results were shared with the school, which offered additional tutoring. Daphne attended only a few sessions, stating that they were not helpful. Her parents talked to the school counselors and Daphne’s teachers, asking for more services. They were told repeatedly that Daphne needed to be more assertive and ask for help. Several teachers commented that Daphne should be more motivated and try harder. Several years earlier, her pediatrician had diagnosed ADHD and prescribed a stimulant. She took the medication for a week, but her parents stopped giving it to her because she seemed agitated.\n\nAt home, Daphne’s parents’ close supervision of her homework often led to arguments with crying and screaming. Her behavior and attitude were noticeably better when she was out of school. She had two long-standing friends but had made no new close friends for several years. In groups with other children, she preferred to play with those younger than she. When her friends chose the activity or did not follow her rules, she tended to withdraw. She was generally quiet in groups and in school but more interactive with family members and individuals she knew well.\n\nSince early childhood, Daphne has had difficulty falling asleep, requiring a nightlight and parental reassurance. Recognizing that Daphne was easily upset by change, her parents rarely forced her into new activities. She did well during the summer, which she spent with her grandparents. Her parents reported no particular traumas, stressors, or developmental or medical problems. Daphne had started her menses about 2 months prior to the evaluation. Her family history was pertinent for multiple first- and second-degree relatives with mood, anxiety, or learning disorders.\n\nAt first meeting, Daphne was shy and tense. Her eye contact was poor, and she had difficulty talking about anything other than her plastic horse collection. Within 15 minutes, she became more comfortable, revealing that she disliked school because the work was too hard. She thought that other children did not seem to like her because she was stupid and was not into clothes and dating. Sometimes they made fun of her and would start laughing whenever the teacher called on her. There were several peers who had similar interests in animals and seemed okay. She has been eating lunch with them but found it hard to relax and to believe that they really wanted to be friends. Daphne was always afraid of making mistakes, getting bad grades, and disappointing everyone. Often, she was so preoccupied with what to say or do next that she did not pay attention to her peers or teachers. She frequently was unable to make a decision for fear of not being right. Daphne was unable to identify any personal strengths or any aspect of her life that was going well. She wished she had more friends and that she was smarter. As long as she could remember, she had always felt this way. These difficulties made her sad, but she denied persistent depressive feelings or suicidal thoughts. She appeared anxious but brightened when discussing her horse figurine collection, her longtime friends, and her family.",
         "Daphne has symptoms of inattention, anxiety, academic difficulties, limited peer relationships, and poor self-esteem that are causing distress and impaired functioning. Biologically, Daphne is experiencing the hormonal changes of puberty against the backdrop of a family history of mood, anxiety, and learning disorders. Psychologically, Daphne is living with the belief that she is inadequate, probably connected with her ongoing academic and social difficulties. Developmentally, Daphne’s emotional and social functioning appears to be somewhat delayed, with younger-than-expected interests and coping strategies. Socially, Daphne has a supportive family environment that has emphasized protecting her, possibly interfering with the acquisition of skills related to independence and autonomy. Meanwhile, the educational system has not provided the necessary support for Daphne to succeed.\n\nDaphne’s academic problems can be explained in part by a specific learning disorder in mathematics. She has persistent difficulties with math, supported by testing that showed her performance to be below her intellectual level and chronological age. Her achievement in other academic subjects and her level of adaptive functioning generally appear to be age appropriate, indicating that her global intelligence and adaptive functioning are normal and that she does not have an intellectual developmental disorder.\n\nIt can be difficult to distinguish between anxiety and mood disorders in children Daphne’s age. In this case, an anxiety disorder is more likely because Daphne’s symptoms have been chronic and persistent rather than episodic, which depressive symptoms often are. Daphne’s sadness is related to her sense of failure and worry about her competence. With the exception of a sleep disturbance, she does not have neurovegetative symptoms. Her difficulty with falling asleep appears anxiety based, as do her social ineptitude, reluctance to comply with school demands, and overreaction when faced with unwelcome tasks. In addition to her anxiety about her capabilities, Daphne appears to have concerns about security, which may explain her tense appearance. Daphne manages her anxieties by avoiding or controlling activities. Although some of her concerns are consistent with other anxiety disorders, such as social anxiety disorder or separation anxiety disorder, Daphne’s worries extend beyond those domains. Given the pervasiveness of her anxiety, the most appropriate diagnosis is generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).\n\nGAD is characterized by persistent, excessive anxiety and worry. Symptom criteria include restlessness, poor concentration, irritability, muscle tension, sleep disturbance, and being easily fatigued. Although three of six criteria are required for adults, a GAD diagnosis can be made in children with only one symptom in addition to the excessive anxiety and worry.\n\nSocial difficulties are common among children and adolescents, particularly those with psychiatric disorders. Daphne’s issues are related to her anxiety about being competent and likable. Her academic struggles and anxiety have impeded her development, making her emotionally and socially immature.\n\nHer immaturity might suggest an autism spectrum disorder. She does have difficulty initiating social interactions and engaging in reciprocity with peers (with poor eye contact notable on examination), but Daphne does not have the communication difficulties, rigidity, or stereotyped behaviors associated with autism. Her behavior improves with familiarity, and she expresses interest in her peers.\n\nDaphne’s language, speech, and communication skills seem developmentally appropriate, making disorders in these areas unlikely.\n\nOppositional defiant disorder might also be considered because Daphne is resistant and uncooperative in school and at home when it comes to her academic work. However, this attitude and behavior do not carry over to other situations, and her behaviors do not meet oppositional defiant disorder’s requirements for symptom level and frequency. They are better conceptualized as a manifestation of anxiety and an attempt at its management.\n\nInattention is a symptom that occurs in a variety of diagnoses. Individuals with ADHD have problems with attention, impulsivity, and/or hyperactivity that occur in multiple settings prior to age 12 and cause significant impairment. Although Daphne has several symptoms consistent with inattention, these seem confined to school settings. She also does not appear to have significant problems with behaviors related to impulsivity or activity regulation. ADHD should remain a diagnostic possibility, but other diagnoses better account for Daphne’s difficulties.\n\nThe environmental contributions to Daphne’s problems should not be minimized. Her central psychiatric diagnoses—a specific learning disorder in mathematics and GAD—do not appear to have been adequately addressed either at home or at school. With more adequate services, Daphne would likely feel less anxiety and emotional distress and be far more likely to succeed in her course work and to stay on track developmentally.\n\nAlthough the case report indicates that Daphne’s diagnosis and treatment were delayed, we do not know much about her demographic background. In general, we know that learning disorders in children often go unidentified, especially for children whose families are poor, members of historically marginalized groups, immigrants, or living in adverse circumstances. Daphne’s parents tried to advocate for a more thorough diagnosis (and treatment), with little apparent success. Their efforts to shield Daphne from stress were well meaning but might have prevented her from gaining successful experiences and contributed to her sense of incompetence.\n\nIt would be useful to better understand Daphne’s perspective on her anxiety, her academic performance, and anything else that she finds interesting or problematic. She has experienced negative, critical comments that might have escalated to bullying and harassment. An evaluation that looks specifically for these common experiences is likely not only to find additional problems but also to be felt as empathic by patients who might otherwise quietly hold on to private shames.",

         "Ethan, a 9-year-old boy, was referred to a psychiatric clinic by his teacher, who noticed that his attention was flagging. At that time, Ethan was a fourth grader at a private regular-education school for boys. The teacher told Ethan’s parents that although Ethan had been among the best students in his class in the fall, his grades had slipped during the spring semester. He tended to get fidgety and distracted when the academic work became more challenging, and the teacher suggested the parents seek neuropsychiatric testing for him.\n\nAt home, Ethan’s mother explained, he seemed more emotional of late: “He just looks weepy sometimes, which is unusual for him.” She denied any difficulties at home, and she described her husband, son, 8-year-old daughter, and herself as a “happy family.” She had noticed, however, that Ethan seemed uneasy about being left alone. He had become “clingy,” often following his parents around the house, and he hated being in any room by himself. Ethan had also started climbing into bed with his parents in the middle of the night, something he had never done in the past. Although Ethan had a few good friends in the neighborhood and at school and was glad to have other kids come to his house, he refused to go on sleepovers.\n\nEthan’s mother agreed that he appeared more fidgety. She had noticed that he often seemed to be shrugging his shoulders, grimacing, and blinking, which she took to be a sign of anxiety. These movements worsened when he was tired or frustrated, and they diminished in frequency during calm, focused activities such as clarinet practice or homework, especially when she was helping him.\n\nHis mother also mentioned that Ethan had suddenly become “superstitious.” Whenever he stepped through a doorway, he would go back and forth until he touched both doorjambs with his hands simultaneously, twice in rapid succession. She hoped that Ethan’s more conspicuous habits would subside by summer, when the family took its annual vacation. She felt that it was the right year for Disneyland, but Ethan’s father had suggested taking him on a fishing trip (“just the boys”) while mother and daughter visited relatives in New York City.\n\nEthan’s mother recalled her son as an “easy child, but sensitive.” He was the product of a planned, uncomplicated pregnancy and met all his developmental milestones on time. He had no history of medical problems or recent infections, but his mother mentioned that he had begun to make frequent visits to the school nurse’s office complaining of stomachaches.\n\nOn examination, Ethan was a slightly built boy with fair, freckly skin and blond hair. He was somewhat fidgety, tugging at his pants and shifting in his seat. Hearing his mother talk about his new movements seemed to provoke them, and the examiner noted that Ethan also occasionally blinked tightly, rolled his eyes, and made throat-clearing noises. Ethan said that he sometimes worried about “bad things” happening to his parents. His concerns were vague, however, and he seemed to fear only that burglars might break into their house.",
         "Ethan presents with declining school performance, which his family seems to attribute to a cluster of anxiety symptoms that are of relatively recent onset. He is uneasy with solitude and reluctant to attend sleepovers, has fears that bad things will happen to his parents, and makes frequent trips to the school nurse. He appears to meet criteria for DSM-5 separation anxiety disorder, the symptoms of which need only persist for 1 month in children and adolescents.\n\nEthan’s mother also points out that he has become more fidgety. She links his shoulder shrugging, grimacing, and blinking to this recent onset of separation anxiety. Neither the parents nor the teacher appears to recognize these movements as tics, which are nonrhythmic movements of short duration and sudden onset. Ethan appears to have a variety of tics, including those observed by the interviewer: some motor (blinks, shoulder rolls) and some vocal (chirps, grunts, throat clearing, sniffs, clicks). Tics can be simple, meaning that they last only milliseconds, or complex, which are of longer duration or consist of a chain or sequence of movements. Although tics may vary broadly throughout the course of a tic disorder, they tend to recur in a specific repertoire during any given period of the illness.\n\nThe specific tic disorder (if any) is determined by the type and duration of movements. In Tourette’s disorder, both motor and vocal tics must be present, whereas in persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder, only motor or vocal tics are present. Ethan has a mixture of tics, but at this point they have been present for only about 6 months—not the minimum of 1 year required for either Tourette’s disorder or persistent tic disorder. Therefore, Ethan is diagnosed with provisional tic disorder.\n\nTics occur in 15%–20% of children, and it appears that 0.6%–1.0% develop Tourette’s disorder. On average, tics emerge between ages 4 and 6, reach peak severity by age 10–12, and generally decline in severity during adolescence. Tics first observed in adulthood were very likely present but unnoticed in childhood. Tics are typically worsened by anxiety, excitement, and exhaustion and abate during calm, focused activity—which is why that fishing trip with dad may be Ethan’s best bet for a summer vacation.\n\nAnxiety likely explains Ethan’s inattention in the classroom. Although attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, inattentive subtype, cannot be ruled out, it seems more probable that tics and anxiety have taken Ethan off task, as he has no early history of inattention or hyperactivity. His success in the fall semester all but rules out a learning disorder, so no testing is indicated. (As a rule, testing should always follow the treatment of a confounding problem such as anxiety.)\n\nEthan does manifest rituals in the doorway, which suggests OCD, which is an illness that often co-occurs with both anxiety and tic disorders. Although that possibility might be further explored, a diagnosis of OCD—like that of other psychiatric disorders—requires not only symptoms but also a clinical evaluation that finds the symptoms are distressing or impairing. Without additional information as to whether the rituals have an impact on him, Ethan would not meet criteria for OCD.",

         "Ashley, age 17, was referred for a diagnostic reevaluation after having carried diagnoses of autism and intellectual disability for almost all of her life. She was recently found to have Kleefstra syndrome, and the family wanted to reconfirm the earlier diagnoses and assess the genetic risk to the future children of her older sisters.\n\nAt the time of the reevaluation, Ashley was attending a special school with a focus on functional skills. She was able to dress herself, but she was not able to shower independently or be left alone in the house. She was able to decode (e.g., read words) and spell at a second-grade level but understood little of what she read. Changes to her schedule and heightened functional expectations tended to make her irritable. When upset, Ashley would often hurt herself (e.g., biting her wrist) and others (e.g., pinching and hair pulling).\n\nIn formal testing done at the time of the reevaluation, Ashley had a nonverbal IQ of 39 and a verbal IQ of 23, with a full scale IQ of 31. Her adaptive scores were somewhat higher, with an overall score of 42 (with 100 as average).\n\nBy history, Ashley first received services at age 9 months after her parents noticed significant motor delays. She walked at 20 months and was toilet trained at 5 years. She spoke her first word at age 6. She received a diagnosis of developmental delay at age 3 and of autism, obesity, and static encephalopathy at age 4. An early evaluation noted possible facial dysmorphology; genetic tests at that time were noncontributory.\n\nHer parents indicated that Ashley knew hundreds of single words and many simple phrases. She had long been very interested in license plates and would draw them for hours. Her strongest skill was memory, and she could draw precise representations of license plates from different states. Ashley had always been very attached to her parents and sisters, and although affectionate toward babies, she showed minimal interest in other teenagers.\n\nAshley’s family history was pertinent for a father with dyslexia, a paternal uncle with epilepsy, and a maternal male cousin with possible “Asperger’s syndrome.” Her siblings, both sisters, were in college and doing well.\n\nOn examination, Ashley was an overweight young woman who made inconsistent eye contact but often peered out the corner of her eye. She had a beautiful smile and would sometimes laugh to herself, but most of the time her facial expressions were subdued. She did not initiate joint attention by trying to catch another person’s eyes. She frequently ignored what others would say to her. To request a preferred object (e.g., a shiny magazine), Ashley would rock from foot to foot and point. When offered an object (e.g., a small decorated box), she brought it to her nose and lips for inspection. Ashley spoke in a high-pitched voice with unusual intonation. During the interview, she used multiple words and a few short phrases that were somewhat rote but communicative, such as “I want to clean up,” and “Do you have a van?”\n\nIn the months prior to the evaluation, Ashley’s parents noticed that she had become increasingly apathetic. A medical evaluation concluded that urinary tract infections were the most likely cause for her symptoms, but antibiotics seemed only to make her more listless. Further medical evaluation led to more extensive genetic testing, and Ashley was diagnosed with Kleefstra syndrome, a rare genetic defect associated with multiple medical problems, including intellectual developmental disorder. The parents said they were also tested and found to “be negative.”\n\nThe parents specifically wanted to know whether the genetic testing results affected Ashley’s long-standing diagnoses and access to future services. Furthermore, they wanted to know whether their other two daughters should get tested for their risk of carrying genes for autism, intellectual disability, and/or Kleefstra syndrome.",

         "Brandon was a 12-year-old boy brought in by his mother for psychiatric evaluation for temper tantrums that seemed to be contributing to declining school performance. The mother became emotional as she reported that things had always been difficult but had become worse after Brandon entered middle school. Shortly after starting middle school, Brandon had started complaining of stomachaches on school-day mornings and was often reluctant to go to school.\n\nBrandon’s sixth-grade teachers reported that he was academically capable but that he had little ability to make friends. He seemed to mistrust the intentions of classmates who tried to be nice to him but attempted to befriend others who laughingly feigned interest in the toy cars and trucks that he brought to school. The teachers noted that he often cried and rarely spoke in class. In recent months, multiple teachers had heard him screaming at other boys, generally in the hallway but sometimes in the middle of class. The teachers had not identified a cause but generally had not disciplined Brandon because they assumed he was responding to provocation. He was embarrassed about these outbursts and did not want to go to swim practice because he did not want his swim friends to ask why he’d had an outburst at school.\n\nWhen interviewed alone, Brandon responded with nonspontaneous mumbles when asked questions about school, classmates, and his family. When the examiner asked if he was interested in toy cars, however, Brandon lit up. He pulled several cars, trucks, and airplanes from his backpack and, while not making good eye contact, did talk at length about vehicles, using their apparently accurate names (e.g., front-end loader, B-52, Jaguar). When asked again about school, Brandon pulled out his cell phone and showed a string of text messages: “dumbo!!!!” “mr stutter”; “LoSeR”; “freak!”; “EVERYBODY HATES YOU.” While the examiner read the long string of texts that Brandon had saved but apparently not previously revealed, Brandon added that other boys would whisper “bad words” to him in class and then scream in his ears in the hall. “And I hate loud noises.” He also told the examiner that he sometimes wished that he had never been born.\n\nDevelopmentally, Brandon spoke his first word at age 11 months and began to use short sentences by age 3. He had always been very focused on trucks, cars, and trains. According to his mother, he had always been “very shy” and had never had a best friend. As he has gotten older, it has become more apparent that he struggles with jokes and typical young adolescent banter because “he takes things so literally.” Brandon’s mother had long seen this behavior as “a little odd” but added that it was not much different from that of Brandon’s father, a successful attorney, who had similarly focused interests. Both of them were “sticklers for routine” who “lacked a sense of humor.” Brandon’s mother noted that he made efforts to conceal his interest in trucks, cars, and trains outside of the home but would eagerly speak about them when encouraged. Brandon has shared with his mother that he tries to appear “normal” when interacting with peers at school, which is exhausting. He often feels nervous around peers and generally tries to avoid socializing.\n\nOn examination, Brandon was shy and generally nonspontaneous. He made below-average eye contact. His speech was coherent and goal directed. At times, Brandon stumbled over his words, paused excessively, and sometimes rapidly repeated words or parts of words. Brandon said he felt okay but added that he was scared of school, particularly when around other children. He appeared sad, brightening only when discussing his toy cars. He denied current suicidal thoughts or plans as well as homicidality. He denied psychotic symptoms. He was cognitively intact.",

         "Carlos was a 19-year-old Hispanic college student in his freshman year at a public university in a large city. He was referred by his guidance counselor to the hospital’s outpatient psychiatric clinic for help with academic difficulties. Since starting college 6 months earlier, he had done poorly on tests and been unable to manage his study schedule. His worries that he was going to flunk out of college were leading to anxiety, insomnia, poor concentration, and a general sense of hopelessness. After a particularly tough week, he told his family that he thought he should quit. His mother accompanied him to the clinic that had previously helped both Carlos and his younger brother. The mother specifically wondered whether Carlos’s “ADHD” might be causing his problems, or whether he had outgrown it.\n\nCarlos had been seen at the same clinic when he was age 9, at which time he had been diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), predominantly combined type. Notes from that clinical evaluation indicated that Carlos had been in trouble at school for not following instructions, not completing homework, getting out of his seat, losing things, not waiting his turn, and not listening. He had trouble concentrating except in regard to video games, which he “could play for hours.” Carlos had apparently been slow to talk, but his birth and developmental histories were otherwise normal. He repeated first grade because of behavioral immaturity and difficulty learning to read. The ease with which Carlos learned English, his second language, was not noted. His family had emigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic when he was 5 years old. The family was Catholic and attended church every Sunday. Both of his parents worked in maintenance and housekeeping at a local municipal hospital.\n\nDuring the evaluation when Carlos was age 9, a psychoeducational assessment by a clinical psychologist confirmed reading problems (particularly problems in reading fluency and comprehension). Carlos did not, however, meet the school board criteria for a learning disability, which required evidence of a 20-point discrepancy between IQ and achievement scores. Thus, he was not eligible for special education services. The evaluator had noted Carlos to be eager to do well and anxious about underperforming. His anxiety was thought to be a reaction to his school difficulties and his challenges in meeting the academic expectations of his family. Carlos’s pediatrician had recommended pharmacotherapy, but his parents did not want to pursue medication. They cited negative experiences with local youth who used diverted controlled substances and hung out “on the street.” Instead, his mother reported taking on an extra job to pay for tutors to help her son “with concentration and reading.” The eldest of four siblings, Carlos had done well with this intervention and was now the first member of his family to attend college.\n\nThe psychiatry trainee carefully reviewed Carlos’s academic history; his symptoms, including the course and severity of sadness, anxiety, insomnia, and hopelessness; and his social and developmental history. She obtained collateral history from his family and school records. She used the revised DSM-5-TR Core Cultural Formulation Interview for assistance in obtaining a better understanding of Carlos’s acculturation experiences, the family’s past feelings about the clinic’s recommendations, and what treatment interventions would be relevant and acceptable to Carlos and his family.\n\nThe psychiatry trainee learned that Carlos had a childhood history of “nervousness” identified by a neighborhood curandera (traditional healer) as ataque de nervios. The family had addressed this problem with supportive prayer and a traditional herbal tea. They had apparently not revealed this to the psychiatrist at the time, thinking he would find it irrelevant and not wishing to seem disrespectful of his authority. During these unrevealed episodes of acute anxiety, Carlos would experience trembling and agitation, palpitations, shortness of breath, dread of harm, and fear of separation from caregivers. Workup by the pediatrician had revealed no physiological cause.\n\nSince starting college, Carlos reported that he had frequently been unable to remain focused while reading and listening to lectures. He was easily sidetracked and therefore had difficulty handing in his written assignments on time. He complained of feeling restless, agitated, and worried. He described difficulty falling asleep, poor energy, and an inability to “have fun” like his peers. He reported that the depressive symptoms went “up and down” over the course of the week and possibly influenced his problems with concentration; it was hard for him to be certain. He denied substance use.\n\nCarlos said that he’d had some great teachers in high school who had understood him, helped him get the meaning of what he read, and allowed him to audiotape lectures and use other formats (e.g., videos, wikis, visual presentations) for final assignments. Without this support at college, he said he felt “lonely, stupid, a failure—unable to cope.”\n\nAlthough advised by his high school teacher to do so, Carlos had not registered with the university’s student disability services office. He preferred not to be seen as different from his peers and thought he should be able to get through college by himself.\n\nCarlos’s family history was positive for ADHD in a younger brother. A cousin was reported to have had “dyslexia” and had dropped out of a local community college after one semester. His social and developmental history revealed that he had been well liked by his cluster of friends throughout school. His group consisted of boys and girls and tended to consist of kids more interested in school than in sports. Carlos denied ever having dated or been sexually active, and he also denied having any significant interest in pursuing either of these activities.\n\nOn examination, Carlos was well-groomed, polite, and soft-spoken. He wore clean jeans, a T-shirt, and a hoodie that he kept pulling down over his face. He sat quietly and hunched over. He sighed a lot and rarely made eye contact with the clinician. He often tapped his fingers and shuffled in his seat but responded appropriately to questions. His command of English appeared strong, but he spoke with a slight Spanish accent. He often mumbled and mispronounced some multisyllabic words (e.g., he said “literalchure” instead of “literature” and “intimate” when he clearly meant “intimidate”). He denied any suicidal thoughts. He appeared motivated to do better. On a follow-up interview with the psychiatry trainee, Carlos asked whether the conversations were confidential. When informed that they were, he hesitantly admitted that he felt overwhelmed by new relationships with college peers. He indicated that “in my neighborhood growing up, everybody was Dominican, but in college, I’m the only Dominican.” He also quietly said that he thought he might “like guys rather than girls.” He revealed two recent episodes of panic “like when I was a kid” that had occurred during social situations. He declined to go into further detail.\n\nAfter these two initial sessions, the psychiatrist suggested extending the evaluation so that they could optimize a treatment strategy. She told Carlos that she wanted to better understand his mood and anxiety symptoms, as well as how he felt about being the first in his family to go to college (i.e., role transitions), and to talk a little more about his concerns about his sexual orientation. She also referred Carlos for updated psychoeducational testing. This psychoeducational reassessment confirmed that Carlos’s reading and writing abilities were substantially and quantifiably below those expected for his age. That report also concluded that these learning difficulties were not attributable to intellectual developmental disorder, uncorrected visual or auditory acuity, psychosocial adversity, or lack of proficiency in the language of academic instruction. The report concluded that Carlos had specific difficulties with reading fluency and comprehension as well as spelling and written expression.",

         "Daphne, a 13-year-old in the ninth grade, was brought for a psychiatric evaluation because of academic and behavioral struggles. She had particular difficulty starting and completing schoolwork and following instructions, and she had received failing grades in math. When prompted to complete tasks, Daphne became argumentative and irritable. She had become increasingly resistant to attending school, asking to stay home with her mother. These difficulties had been evident since early childhood but had worsened significantly this year. Because Daphne had become increasingly distressed, her parents have been less insistent on making her do any activity that upsets her.\n\nPsychological testing indicated that Daphne had above-average intelligence, age-appropriate achievement in all subjects except math, and some difficulties in visuospatial skills. The test results were shared with the school, which offered additional tutoring. Daphne attended only a few sessions, stating that they were not helpful. Her parents talked to the school counselors and Daphne’s teachers, asking for more services. They were told repeatedly that Daphne needed to be more assertive and ask for help. Several teachers commented that Daphne should be more motivated and try harder. Several years earlier, her pediatrician had diagnosed ADHD and prescribed a stimulant. She took the medication for a week, but her parents stopped giving it to her because she seemed agitated.\n\nAt home, Daphne’s parents’ close supervision of her homework often led to arguments with crying and screaming. Her behavior and attitude were noticeably better when she was out of school. She had two long-standing friends but had made no new close friends for several years. In groups with other children, she preferred to play with those younger than she. When her friends chose the activity or did not follow her rules, she tended to withdraw. She was generally quiet in groups and in school but more interactive with family members and individuals she knew well.\n\nSince early childhood, Daphne has had difficulty falling asleep, requiring a nightlight and parental reassurance. Recognizing that Daphne was easily upset by change, her parents rarely forced her into new activities. She did well during the summer, which she spent with her grandparents. Her parents reported no particular traumas, stressors, or developmental or medical problems. Daphne had started her menses about 2 months prior to the evaluation. Her family history was pertinent for multiple first- and second-degree relatives with mood, anxiety, or learning disorders.\n\nAt first meeting, Daphne was shy and tense. Her eye contact was poor, and she had difficulty talking about anything other than her plastic horse collection. Within 15 minutes, she became more comfortable, revealing that she disliked school because the work was too hard. She thought that other children did not seem to like her because she was stupid and was not into clothes and dating. Sometimes they made fun of her and would start laughing whenever the teacher called on her. There were several peers who had similar interests in animals and seemed okay. She has been eating lunch with them but found it hard to relax and to believe that they really wanted to be friends. Daphne was always afraid of making mistakes, getting bad grades, and disappointing everyone. Often, she was so preoccupied with what to say or do next that she did not pay attention to her peers or teachers. She frequently was unable to make a decision for fear of not being right. Daphne was unable to identify any personal strengths or any aspect of her life that was going well. She wished she had more friends and that she was smarter. As long as she could remember, she had always felt this way. These difficulties made her sad, but she denied persistent depressive feelings or suicidal thoughts. She appeared anxious but brightened when discussing her horse figurine collection, her longtime friends, and her family.",

         "Ethan, a 9-year-old boy, was referred to a psychiatric clinic by his teacher, who noticed that his attention was flagging. At that time, Ethan was a fourth grader at a private regular-education school for boys. The teacher told Ethan’s parents that although Ethan had been among the best students in his class in the fall, his grades had slipped during the spring semester. He tended to get fidgety and distracted when the academic work became more challenging, and the teacher suggested the parents seek neuropsychiatric testing for him.\n\nAt home, Ethan’s mother explained, he seemed more emotional of late: “He just looks weepy sometimes, which is unusual for him.” She denied any difficulties at home, and she described her husband, son, 8-year-old daughter, and herself as a “happy family.” She had noticed, however, that Ethan seemed uneasy about being left alone. He had become “clingy,” often following his parents around the house, and he hated being in any room by himself. Ethan had also started climbing into bed with his parents in the middle of the night, something he had never done in the past. Although Ethan had a few good friends in the neighborhood and at school and was glad to have other kids come to his house, he refused to go on sleepovers.\n\nEthan’s mother agreed that he appeared more fidgety. She had noticed that he often seemed to be shrugging his shoulders, grimacing, and blinking, which she took to be a sign of anxiety. These movements worsened when he was tired or frustrated, and they diminished in frequency during calm, focused activities such as clarinet practice or homework, especially when she was helping him.\n\nHis mother also mentioned that Ethan had suddenly become “superstitious.” Whenever he stepped through a doorway, he would go back and forth until he touched both doorjambs with his hands simultaneously, twice in rapid succession. She hoped that Ethan’s more conspicuous habits would subside by summer, when the family took its annual vacation. She felt that it was the right year for Disneyland, but Ethan’s father had suggested taking him on a fishing trip (“just the boys”) while mother and daughter visited relatives in New York City.\n\nEthan’s mother recalled her son as an “easy child, but sensitive.” He was the product of a planned, uncomplicated pregnancy and met all his developmental milestones on time. He had no history of medical problems or recent infections, but his mother mentioned that he had begun to make frequent visits to the school nurse’s office complaining of stomachaches.\n\nOn examination, Ethan was a slightly built boy with fair, freckly skin and blond hair. He was somewhat fidgety, tugging at his pants and shifting in his seat. Hearing his mother talk about his new movements seemed to provoke them, and the examiner noted that Ethan also occasionally blinked tightly, rolled his eyes, and made throat-clearing noises. Ethan said that he sometimes worried about “bad things” happening to his parents. His concerns were vague, however, and he seemed to fear only that burglars might break into their house.",

The episode started 2 months prior, with rapidly progressive tendencies towards isolation, irritability, and increased religious concerns. The symptoms progressed into statements of hopelessness and self-depreciation, along with a refusal to eat. As the symptoms progressed, the family noticed a marked weight loss of 15 kg per month (15% of initial weight) as well as episodes of vomiting resistant to symptomatic treatment. The initial clinical evaluation revealed signs of extracellular dehydration, a BMI of 18 kg/m2, and a total functional impotence. The psychiatric examination revealed an alert, yet apathetic patient who remained in bed, had difficulty with social interactions, emotional numbness, irritability, and anxiety. She expressed delusional thoughts of hopelessness, punishment, and suicidal ideation.\n\nThe patient was admitted to a psychiatric department, and upon the reintroduction of oral nutrition, she reported abdominal pain, diarrhoea, tachypnoea, along with low oxygen levels. Biochemical analysis showed elevated blood sugar levels, low potassium, phosphate, and magnesium levels. Inappropriate refeeding syndrome (IRS) was diagnosed, and the patient was transferred to an intensive care unit for 4 days, where she received parenteral nutrition and vitamin supplementation (Vit B1, Vit B9, Vit D, and Vit E).

         "A black male in his early 20s with a remote history of depression as an adolescent and current cannabis use presented following an assault while incarcerated. He was found unconscious with mental status changes and brought to the hospital. Initial examination and work-up revealed right-sided periorbital edema and ecchymosis. The patient was arousable to noxious stimuli but would quickly return to sleep and was not interactive during multiple examination attempts. The emergency department staff believed there was a volitional component to his lack of participation in the exam, as he would push away from providers as they examined him or lie unresponsive. At one point, the patient was able to ambulate briefly while in the emergency department (although he ran into several objects) and tolerated an oral intake challenge with juice. Over the course of 5 days, the patient was returned to the emergency department by the facility four more times due to concerns that his mental status was not improving. The facility reported the patient was unable to attend to his ADLs. He was seen to be withdrawn, not eating or drinking, and toileting on himself or the floor. Additionally, guards (as he was incarcerated for part of his hospital admission) reported that he would occasionally speak to family members and staff. However, when he was offered paperwork to sign himself out of jail with an ankle monitor, he only gazed at the officer without speaking.\n\nUrine toxicology was positive for THC and a negative blood alcohol level. He was found to have ketones consistent with starvation ketosis. Lumbar puncture revealed CSF cell count with six total nucleated cells present, <2,000 RBC, 54 mg/dL glucose, and 39 mg/dL protein. Meningitis/encephalitis panel for 14 common viral and bacterial pathogens and antibody testing for West Nile Virus was negative. CT of the head showed no fractures of the face/vertebra and was negative for other acute findings. EEG was read as consistent with a normal drowsy state. MRI of the brain, both with and without contrast, showed a cerebellar developmental venous anomaly but no acute findings. A neurology consult was obtained. His neurologic exam was noted to be variable, with poor participation despite repeated prompting, making full examination difficult. He responded to pain equally in all extremities, demonstrated no abnormal movements, had 2+ reflexes symmetrically, and normal pupillary response. Neurology ultimately felt that his LP, MRI, and EEG were unremarkable, and his symptomatology could be explained by postconcussive symptoms.\n\nOnce the patient was admitted, he was initially treated with a trial of Modafinil for suspected postconcussive syndrome, to which there was no response. On Day 6 of his hospitalization, when the psychiatric consultation service reconsidered his disordered behavior, psychomotor retardation, and speech with consideration for the presence of catatonia, the question of “volitional” inactivity took on a new meaning. There were numerous catatonia signs present to variable degrees: mutism, decreased oral intake, negativism, withdrawal, and decreased spontaneous movement. No automatic obedience, ambitendency, or rigidity was appreciated. ",

         "In October 2023, a 24-year-old unemployed male presented to the Antalya Ataturk State Hospital outpatient substance addiction treatment clinic for IV BN misuse. He was suffering from pain and restlessness secondary to cessation of BN. In the last 3 months, when he reduced or ceased BN, symptoms, such as restlessness, lacrimation, back and extremity pain, cramps, and insomnia, started to appear within hours. He felt dysphoric and exhausted when he did not use BN. Due to escalating BN use, he has begun to suspect dependency on the medication. The patient had no history of any medical illness in the past.\n\nOn the mental status examination, the patient appeared to be tense. Her speech was normal. He was dysphoric. Psychomotor activity was increased, consistent with opiate withdrawal. The content of his thoughts was dominated by an inability to move away from substance use and pessimistic thoughts associated with it. He had no signs of delusion or hallucinations. His attention was prone to be easily distracted.\n\nThroughout his adolescence, there were no symptoms suggestive of borderline personality traits or conduct disorder. His substance use history began at the age of 15 with experimenting with marijuana, introduced by friends out of curiosity. He described feeling euphoria and numbness, using one joint 2–3 times a week. At 18, witnessing someone using heroin in a social setting led him to try it. He had smoked heroin it for a month. Switching to IV use after a friend claimed it provided a better “high,” he continued with 1–2 g of IV heroin daily for the next 5 years (except in his mandatory military service period at 19 for 6 months). He also occasionally used crack cocaine (2 or 3 times a week) in combination with heroin. Infrequently, he encountered and used methamphetamine less than once a month.\n\nAbout 14 months ago, he was referred to an outpatient substance addiction treatment clinic in another city. An oral BN treatment was initiated at 8 mg daily (2 mg, 4 times a day). After using one or two tablets, he later transitioned to IV use following a friend's suggestion. While he initially described a sense of relaxation and elevation similar to heroin use, recent injections have been solely to alleviate withdrawal symptoms—especially pain. He started with a single IV usage of 2 mg. Over the past 3–4 months, his IV BN use reached 12–16 mg daily with a frequency of four to five injections per day due to tolerance. To mitigate withdrawal symptoms, such as pain, fatigue, restlessness, hot flashes, and insomnia, when using less or abstaining from BN, he started using pregabaline 6 months ago. Subsequently, there was an increase in pregabalin misuse, reaching 3,000 mg daily during this period when he ceased BN use. Within the last month prior to admission, he had not used any pregabaline. Due to conflicts in the marriage and financial difficulties, he separated from his wife. For the past 5 months, he has been living with his parents.",

He exercised obsessively according to his food intake. Although he was considerably losing weight, he commented that his belly was fat and did not want it to get any fatter. Body image disturbances and anxiety regarding being overweight were observed. During his initial consultation, he was very lean, with a body mass index (BMI) of 11.5 kg/m2. He also had sinus bradycardia with a heart rate of approximately 40 beats/min. We attempted to improve his weight with enteral nutritional supplements while identifying underlying diseases by head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and abdominal ultrasound. However, he became disoriented and was emergently hospitalized 7 days after his first visit. On admission, he was 145 cm tall, weighed 20.9 kg (BMI: 9.9 kg/m2), and presented with impaired consciousness with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) E3V4M6, bradycardia with a heart rate of about 40 beats/min, and slow breathing with a respiratory rate of about 10 cycles/min. Blood gas analysis and blood test revealed hypercapnia, hypoglycemia, and elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and transaminases.

In the 6 days prior to admission, the patient exhibited notable behavioral changes, including nihilistic comments and explicit thoughts of self-harm that were accompanied by poor sleep, depressive mood, and nonspecific visual hallucinations. He was brought into the emergency department for these thoughts and depressed mood he was incidentally found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. He was admitted to the medical floor for isolation.\n\nWhile on the medical floor, initial workup included a negative urine drug screening and an unremarkable cranial CT scan. EEG was also negative. The patient met the criteria for MDD with psychotic features. Evaluation at this time was remarkable for marked personal hygiene neglect, social withdrawal, sadness of mood, diminished interest in almost all activities, anhedonia, ideas of worthlessness, hopelessness, and guilt. He also endorsed poor sleep and no appetite despite refusing to eat since being admitted to the hospital. Patient also endorsed experiencing some anxiety secondary to his nihilism which presented as a belief that he was already dead and that his insides were poisonous to others. This belief was so strong that the patient was afraid to urinate or defecate thinking he would kill the entire hospital by doing so. Once cleared from COVID-19, he was transferred to the inpatient psychiatric floor.",

         "A black male in his early 20s with a remote history of depression as an adolescent and current cannabis use presented following an assault while incarcerated. He was found unconscious with mental status changes and brought to the hospital. Initial examination and work-up revealed right-sided periorbital edema and ecchymosis. The patient was arousable to noxious stimuli but would quickly return to sleep and was not interactive during multiple examination attempts. The emergency department staff believed there was a volitional component to his lack of participation in the exam, as he would push away from providers as they examined him or lie unresponsive. At one point, the patient was able to ambulate briefly while in the emergency department (although he ran into several objects) and tolerated an oral intake challenge with juice. Over the course of 5 days, the patient was returned to the emergency department by the facility four more times due to concerns that his mental status was not improving. The facility reported the patient was unable to attend to his ADLs. He was seen to be withdrawn, not eating or drinking, and toileting on himself or the floor. Additionally, guards (as he was incarcerated for part of his hospital admission) reported that he would occasionally speak to family members and staff. However, when he was offered paperwork to sign himself out of jail with an ankle monitor, he only gazed at the officer without speaking.\n\nUrine toxicology was positive for THC and a negative blood alcohol level. He was found to have ketones consistent with starvation ketosis. Lumbar puncture revealed CSF cell count with six total nucleated cells present, <2,000 RBC, 54 mg/dL glucose, and 39 mg/dL protein. Meningitis/encephalitis panel for 14 common viral and bacterial pathogens and antibody testing for West Nile Virus was negative. CT of the head showed no fractures of the face/vertebra and was negative for other acute findings. EEG was read as consistent with a normal drowsy state. MRI of the brain, both with and without contrast, showed a cerebellar developmental venous anomaly but no acute findings. A neurology consult was obtained. His neurologic exam was noted to be variable, with poor participation despite repeated prompting, making full examination difficult. He responded to pain equally in all extremities, demonstrated no abnormal movements, had 2+ reflexes symmetrically, and normal pupillary response. Neurology ultimately felt that his LP, MRI, and EEG were unremarkable, and his symptomatology could be explained by postconcussive symptoms.\n\nOnce the patient was admitted, he was initially treated with a trial of Modafinil for suspected postconcussive syndrome, to which there was no response. On Day 6 of his hospitalization, when the psychiatric consultation service reconsidered his disordered behavior, psychomotor retardation, and speech with consideration for the presence of catatonia, the question of “volitional” inactivity took on a new meaning. There were numerous catatonia signs present to variable degrees: mutism, decreased oral intake, negativism, withdrawal, and decreased spontaneous movement. No automatic obedience, ambitendency, or rigidity was appreciated. ",

         "A 12-year-old male with no specific birth or medical history became concerned about lower abdominal distention and began reducing his food intake 3 months prior to consultation. He exercised obsessively according to his food intake. Although he was considerably losing weight, he commented that his belly was fat and did not want it to get any fatter. Body image disturbances and anxiety regarding being overweight were observed. During his initial consultation, he was very lean, with a body mass index (BMI) of 11.5 kg/m2. He also had sinus bradycardia with a heart rate of approximately 40 beats/min. We attempted to improve his weight with enteral nutritional supplements while identifying underlying diseases by head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and abdominal ultrasound. However, he became disoriented and was emergently hospitalized 7 days after his first visit. On admission, he was 145 cm tall, weighed 20.9 kg (BMI: 9.9 kg/m2), and presented with impaired consciousness with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) E3V4M6, bradycardia with a heart rate of about 40 beats/min, and slow breathing with a respiratory rate of about 10 cycles/min. Blood gas analysis and blood test revealed hypercapnia, hypoglycemia, and elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and transaminases. His movements were slow but not paralytic and his cranial nerves were normal. ",

         "We report on a 35-year-old female with a history of schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, and cocaine use disorder, with multiple previous psychiatric admissions, who was brought to our hospital's crisis unit after her parents called police, complaining that she had become aggressive and was “acting delusional” during an argument. According to her parents, the patient had demanded a DNA test to prove that her parents were not her biological parents and that her son was not her biological son. One week prior to admission, the patient's parents had reported her missing when she “disappeared” from their home soon after being discharged from our hospital following a similar presentation. Prior to admission, the patient's medications included lamotrigine, clonazepam, and long-acting injectable aripiprazole; however, her adherence to treatment recommendations was poor.\n\nAlthough her parents claimed that she resided with them and her 2-year-old son, the patient endorsed a recent history of homelessness lasting several months. The patient said that during this period of homelessness, she had been sexually assaulted by a stranger in his hotel room. Collateral revealed that per court order, the patient's continued custody of her son was contingent on her adherence to psychotropic medications and inpatient drug rehabilitation. The patient admitted to using recreational drugs frequently over the past 6 months, including crack cocaine, which she stated she had used during the 1-week interval between hospitalizations.\n\nDuring her initial mental status examination, the patient was poorly groomed, uncooperative, intrusive, and irritable. Her speech was pressured, and she described her recent sleep as poor. She commented that she intended to become pregnant and to sell the baby to an agency for $6,000. She made religious statements about “being fruitful and multiplying” and admitted to recently engaging in hypersexual behavior, explaining that “I have boyfriends on the streets.” She underwent testing for sexually transmitted infections, with reassuring results. She declined voluntary inpatient psychiatric admission and was subsequently screened and committed. We discontinued clonazepam at the time of admission, and we restarted the patient on lamotrigine, adding oral aripiprazole to supplement her long-acting injectable aripiprazole.\n\nDuring her hospitalization, the patient faced several barriers to efficient psychiatric stabilization. First among these was her insistence on refusing any medications that might cause weight gain, including olanzapine. She endorsed allergies to haloperidol, risperidone, lurasidone, and lithium, with symptoms such as “anxiety,” “eye rolling,” and “facial twitching” in response to these drugs. Because she was adherent to oral lamotrigine and aripiprazole, we chose not to seek treatment over objection to administer a stronger antipsychotic medication that would also serve as an effective mood stabilizer. On hospital Day 4, the patient appeared virtually in family court, where she received an ultimatum to cooperate with treatment recommendations in order to maintain custody of her son. Nonetheless, she remained adamant about not being placed on “weight gainers,” stating that “I can have nine more babies. I want to be sexy.” On hospital Day 6, she tested positive for COVID-19 and was quarantined for 10 days on a medical floor. Her respiratory symptoms included cough and rhinorrhea, and she continued to display manic symptoms, including elated affect, hyperverbality, grandiosity, religious preoccupation, and inappropriate laughter. She exhibited behaviors suggestive of sexual preoccupation, such as raising her shirt during interviews to reveal a protuberant abdomen and repeatedly endorsing a desire to “stay sexy.”\n\nAfter her quarantine, the patient returned to the psychiatric unit with her manic symptoms unresolved. On hospital Day 17, she requested a pregnancy test due to concerns that she might have become pregnant because she “had sex with a bunch of guys because I was homeless.” The patient seemed reassured when we explained that her admission pregnancy test was negative. We ordered a new quantitative β-hCG test, which was likewise negative. On Day 18, the patient received a maintenance dose of long-acting injectable aripiprazole. On Day 19, she complained of abdominal and back pain, stating “I've been in labor since last night.” She elaborated that “I can feel the head in my crotch” and “when I lay on my back, I feel the little hands and feet.” She also stated that her “water broke” and her “mucus plug broke.” The patient exhibited several physical signs and symptoms of pregnancy, including a distended abdomen, intermittent “pulsating” bilateral lower abdominal cramps, and sensations of fetal movement. In addition, she endorsed amenorrhea for the past year, except for some “mild spotting” three weeks previously. Convinced that her two recent pregnancy tests were “false negatives” and frustrated that members of the treatment team did not believe she was pregnant, she threatened to sue the hospital for failing to provide obstetric care. The patient lamented that “you all think I'm crazy, but I'm actually pregnant.” At this time, she displayed an intensifying religious preoccupation and stated that she was able to communicate with angels and “see Jesus.” She proclaimed that she herself was a prophet who could interpret the “auras” of hospital staff.\n\nThe patient agreed to a pelvic exam, which revealed a distended, nontender abdomen. The uterus was nongravid. The patient received acetaminophen and heating pads, and we ordered a transabdominal ultrasound to better assess the etiology of her abdominal pain and in the hopes of resolving her condition via additional evidence of nonpregnancy. At this time, the patient began to refuse all previously prescribed medications because she believed these would harm her “baby.” She did, however, agree to begin fluphenazine elixir, which we prescribed to address worsening psychosis.\n\nWhen she arrived in the ultrasound suite, the patient offered the radiology technologist four million dollars “if you get this baby right.” She became euphoric while viewing the ultrasound monitor, exclaiming “That's a head, and that's a penis!” Her speech was pressured, and she perseverated on religious themes, requesting that all non-Christian staff leave the suite and instructing staff to “resist the Devil and he will flee from you!” She also demonstrated sexual preoccupation, recalling an experience in which she had “danced after I had sex” and exclaiming about the size of her “baby's penis,” predicting that he would be “sexy like his daddy.” After the procedure, the patient happily told fellow patients that she would soon deliver another child. She said, “I have been having contractions for 19 hr. When the results come back and they find out I am not crazy, they will finally send me to maternity.”\n\nAn on-call psychiatry resident presented the radiology report to the patient on hospital Day 20. She emphatically refuted the report, articulating a persecutory delusion of a conspiracy waged against her by the treatment team. She stated that the radiologist must have been “paid off” to switch her ultrasound with that of another patient. She continued to refuse medications that she felt might harm her “baby”; however, she agreed to an increase in her dose of fluphenazine. Following this dose increase, her affect remained labile, with frequent swings between euphoria and irritability, but she ceased making comments indicative of religious and sexual preoccupation. As our hospital is a short-term care facility, we decided to refer the patient to a higher level of care facility. On the day of her discharge, the patient told a nurse that “I don't think I'm pregnant anymore; it's all the shit I have inside me,” referring to her constipated bowels.",

         "The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a psychiatric history of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), major depressive disorder (MDD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), dyssomnia, tobacco use disorder, and alcohol use disorder in remission. Her tobacco use disorder began at age 22, and she smoked two packs of cigarettes daily. At age 46, she decreased her tobacco use to smoking one and a half packs of cigarettes daily. Two years later, she further decreased her tobacco use to smoking one pack of cigarettes daily.\n\nHer alcohol use disorder began at age 38, and she drank a pint (473 mL) of hard liquor daily. At age 45, she decreased her alcohol use to half a pint (236.5 mL) of hard liquor daily. The following year, she decreased her alcohol use to only weekends. Two years later, she used alcohol very occasionally. At age 49, her husband passed, and her alcohol use increased to a fifth (750 mL) of gin daily. She was hospitalized twice that year for chronic pancreatitis and quit drinking after the second hospitalization.\n\nShe struggled with worsening GAD, MDD, and PTSD since age 39. At age 46, she was prescribed citalopram but did not tolerate it. At age 49, she began regularly seeing outpatient psychiatry. She was prescribed sertraline and prazosin. A few months later, her MDD and PTSD symptoms significantly improved. However, her GAD worsened, and she had more frequent exacerbations. Her sertraline and prazosin dosages were increased. She was also prescribed hydroxyzine but did not tolerate it. Additionally, she received grief therapy as recommended. Her MDD and PTSD symptoms improved significantly more, but her GAD continued to be uncontrolled. Intermittently, she would be out of her medications, and her MDD and GAD would worsen. Her PTSD was stable, even when out of medication.\n\nAlso, the patient was prescribed melatonin for her dyssomnia at age 50. Her dyssomnia was uncontrolled despite increasing the melatonin dosage. She did not tolerate trazodone. The patient was then lost to follow-up with outpatient psychiatry for 2 years and returned at age 53. Since then, she has had regular follow-up appointments with outpatient psychiatry.\n\nWhen she returned to outpatient psychiatry at age 53, she had been off of all psychiatric medications. Her MDD was partially stable. Her PTSD was stable. Her GAD and dyssomnia were uncontrolled. She had resumed drinking small amounts of alcohol on occasion, about once a month, and she continued to smoke one pack of cigarettes daily. Her sertraline was resumed, and she was started on zolpidem. Her dyssomnia improved with zolpidem. Eventually, her sertraline was switched to paroxetine. After trialing multiple medications, she was started on diazepam for a short period for her uncontrolled anxiety. Psychotherapy was also recommended, but she did not take part in it. In April 2020, at age 55, her outpatient psychiatry appointments were converted from in-person to telehealth due to COVID-19 health regulations.\n\nAt age 49, the patient first noted fatigue and poor memory. At a follow-up appointment a few months later, she continued to report poor memory. A year later, she reported worsening memory, resulting in losing her keys and forgetting important dates. After that, she did not report fatigue or memory concerns for several years.\n\nIn August 2021, at age 56, the patient had mild COVID-19, which did not require hospitalization. Since then, for a period of over 1.5 years, she has reported persistent symptoms associated with LC-19. At her following appointment in December 2021, she noted fatigue, breathlessness, ageusia, poor appetite, weight loss, and “not feeling right.” In January 2022, she also reported poor memory, increased confusion, and being easily distracted. She was concerned she had an unnoticed stroke that was causing these symptoms. In February 2022, these symptoms persisted, and she reported left-side weakness. In April 2022, she also reported anosmia, “brain fog,” and feeling disorganized. She stated she could not describe her cognitive symptoms with words. In August 2022, she also reported generalized weakness, loss of balance, dizziness, body temperature changes, and increased disorganization. She stated she couldn't go to walk-in psychotherapy due to her disorganization.\n\nAt this time, she also began experiencing significant impairments in her daily functioning. She reported difficulties with instrumental activities of daily living, such as cooking. In September 2022, she also reported trouble with word finding. In October 2022, she also reported concern regarding her sensation of touch and vision. She reported that things felt different, and she thought her vision “easily missed things.” For example, she would not have initially seen a trash bag and would suddenly notice it was there. In January 2023, she also expressed feeling unable to drive, although once she was in the car, she could complete the task. In March 2023, she noted not being able to feel her left hand and believed she may have had a stroke to cause this. Other than fatigue and difficulty with memory, the patient did not express any of these symptoms or concerns prior to August 2021.\n\nHer social isolation, due to her symptoms, further exacerbated her distress. She reported excessive anxiety regarding the uncertain etiology of her symptoms. She frequently expressed concern that her physicians were not doing enough to diagnose and treat her. She requested a comprehensive work-up and hospital admission. She did not meet the criteria for hospital admission and was not admitted.",

For the past 2 years, he has used alcohol, cocaine, and medical substance (Lyrica and other medications). He has a history of social anxiety with biological symptoms, which are unresponsive to medication. He expressed low self esteem and feelings of worthlessness. He was pessimistic about the future, saying, “I don't see anything ahead for me.” He described a passive death wish, but denied having any active suicidal thoughts. He described feeling fast heartbeats, blushing, trembling, sweating, trouble catching his breath, dizziness, and panic complaints, especially when talking to people and women in specific. He also described being unable to carry out a conversation with others, feelings of being watched and laughed at, and believing that he is ugly looking. He described having these complaints since adolescence. The patient has been an addict for the past 2 years. He started with Marijuana and alcohol, and then he tried several medical drugs.\nThe patient talked about various upsetting memories of instances that took place during his childhood and up to his late teenage years. This included memories, such as not being given a choice or participating in decision making, his father's absence from the house due to travel, followed by the discovery of his marriage to another woman and the presence of children. His family's upbringing style is firm, authoritarian on the part of the mother, and permissive on the part of the father.",

         "Leroy is a 34 year old male, whose chief complaint is, “I am having intrusive thoughts.” Leroy reports that “since childhood, I have been experiencing intrusive thoughts.” He reports he has met with a number of psychiatrists in the past, and has tried a range of different psychiatric medications. Leroy reports he was recently recommended by his present physician to see a psychiatrist again, given how distressing his intrusive thoughts have become. His previous psychiatrist started him on Zoloft, and gave him recommendation for community based mental health psychotherapist.  Leroy has been taking the Zoloft (200 mg daily) for about 5 years, for what he states his provider thought was “anxiety or depression.” Leroy acknowledges history of periods of “sadness”, stating “yeah sad, sometimes, but not depressed; when things get out of control; its been a while though; when something feels out of reach.” Denied present or past suicidal ideation, and denied problems with active thoughts, plans or intents of harm to self or others. Leroy insists no problems with perceptual distortion or paranoia, and denied thought insertion or thought broadcasting.  Leroy stated that the intrusive thoughts, “first started happening when I was a kid, I was able to cope with them; getting better understanding what they were; ways to get them to go away; calm myself down and regain control and go on with my life; now that is not working.” Leroy states the most recent intrusive thought has been a fear that the chart bus he drives from his local airport to downtown stop will “slide off the road because of ice or snow.” He thinks about this, on average, about 30 to 45 minutes a day.  Leroy endorsed episodes of “panic” and “my body almost feels like its paralyzed; I experience pain from my spine up”, which lasts for a couple of days at a time. With regards to “generalized anxiety”, patient reports “I would have these thoughts about my ailing mother; she has schizophrenia; my body would react to whatever I was thinking about her; my body tenses up when that happens.” Leroy denied any preoccupations about his physical health, nor inability to leave the home because of anxiety. He reports to work regularly, and rarely misses any work unless he is very sick. He says he is never late to work or planned appointments. Leroy has a girlfriend, and says that relationship is going “great.” In his spare time, he continues to join his friends for basketball pickup games and video game nights, which he still enjoys. Leroy does remember a feeling of having to tap the door handle a few times before he opens it, but said this never lasted more than a few second and was not associated with any fear of catastrophic consequences if he did not complete the task.  Leroy acknowledges observed violence/abuse of his parents when growing up, and with harsh parenting to his 3 siblings, patient denied problems with flashbacks, nightmares or hypervigilance associated with the trauma. Patient works second shift, gets home around 1:30 a.m., reports falling asleep at 2:30 a.m. and wakes up at 10/11 a.m., and can typically sleep through the night without interruption. He reports his energy level is “normal through the week.” Denied recent or past mania. Reports contributing stressors are “work --- not the most peaceful environment.” Also reports mother suffers from “type of schizophrenia and for a while she was taking medication and just recently now decided to stop; that’s been going on for quite some time.” Leroy’s urine toxicology returned with marijuana, and TSH level was within normal limits.",

I also lost my career as a farmer.” The patient reports “My girlfriend and I had a good relationship when I used to be able to fish with her; she was a blue blood from the Cape.” Patient reports that he survived being “attacked when I was at a local bar about 4 years ago; the guy smashed a few beer bottles on my head; I had to go to the hospital and they did brain scans; I don’t remember what they said they found.” Patient reports that after that attack, he stopped fishing and started drinking alcohol heavily, at least 8 standard drinks per day, resulting in him missing work, the end of his relationship with his girlfriend, and resulted in getting two DUIs. Patient remembers, “I tried cutting down, but I was never able to do it.” The patient has been sober from alcohol for 76 days now. He denied any other drug use. Patient reports that around two years ago, “I was starting having another MS flare, I stopped being able to sleep for about two weeks and felt angry all the time.” Patient reports during that time he took several last minute trips to Baltimore by train, trying to start a new business and during that time had many sexual indiscretions. He states “people said I was acting strange and that I claimed I was a celebrity that was going to find a cure for autism.” Emil states “I felt like I had endless energy and could take on the world.” The patient reports no similar episodes like that since then, and denied any major mood symptoms since that time. Emil denied recent or past hallucinations, paranoia or thought insertion. Emil reports he never experienced trauma, with the exception of losing his girlfriend and dog. The patient denied any recent problems with depressed, sad, or hopeless mood, and denied problems recent problems with decreased need for sleep and associated elevated energy, racing thoughts, pressured speech or feelings of euphoria. He denied recent or past anxiety or panic, nor OCD.",

The patient frequently punches her mother in the legs, and in the stomach, and the patient even threw her ipad at the pediatrician when she asked the patient what was upsetting her. Most of the patients psychiatric history is gathered from her mother, given how irritable the patient is during the exam. The mother reports Neveah was born 8 weeks pre-mature, spent about 1 month in the neonatal intensive care unit due to problems with breathing, and ultimately discharged home to her care at one month of age. The patient met developmental milestones on or near expected time, and was “clingy” when she was a toddler, but had no problems making friends in daycare and grade school. When patient was about 11 years of age, her biological father left the home to join the military, and has deployed ever since. Around 12 years of age, around summertime, the patient appeared much more talkative, energetic, and would go several days only needing about 3 hours of sleep at night. She was more impulsive during these times, and believed she had super powers to “make her friends get in trouble at school”, even when she was not at school herself. She was never tired the following day. During that same period, she had many temper tantrums throughout the day, almost every day of the week, that seemed disproportionate to circumstances, like having to have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich instead of a peanut butter and fluff sandwich. The tantrums would last several hours in a day. This pattern of behavior would last for several weeks at a time, with periods of months returning to normal mood and behavior. The patient never appeared to be hallucination or responding to internal stimuli, and never appeared sad or depressed. Neveah had to be hospitalized during an episode like this when she was 13 years old. Neveah refuses to take medications for her symptoms. The start of this year academic year, that patient appeared more calm and in good behavioral control, but began to have similar symptoms of irritability, violence at home, not needing to sleep, talking fast, and property destruction at home.",

Elain tried to rescue the pedestrian, and even helped paramedics the responded to the scene provide chest compressions to the pedestrian. Unfortunately the pedestrian was pronounced dead on the scene. Since then, Elain has felt a sense of “dread” and “anxiety” everyday, and feels like every time she hears a cars wheels skid in the street, “I jump out of my skin.” The patient also reports that, when at work, she will have these persistent images of the pedestrian laying in the street, and “I just can’t get the images out of my head.” Elain reports that wakes two or three times a night with nightmares related to the event. Additionally, Elain herself has avoided drying, for fear she will be involved in a car accident herself. She was at work today and decided to come to urgent care because “I was hallucinating” and “I was at my desk and suddenly felt like my body separated from my mind, and I could see myself sitting at my desks, as if I was hovering from above.” Patient denied disorganized speech, thought insertion or thought broadcasting.

He states “I would go to bed around 7 p.m., right after dinner, and not wake up until about 12 p.m. the next day.” He reports before that time, he would go to bed around 10:30 p.m. and wake for work around 6 a.m. He states, “I started to notice that my mom would take longer preparing my plate of food for dinner, and I felt sleepy right after.” He endorsed associated low energy, low motivation and problems with concentration starting around that time. Patient goes on to say “over the past two months, every afternoon when I wake up, I can hear my parents whispering through the vents of the house, planning on killing me and replacing me with a different person.” Patient states he will sometimes also “hear them whispering when I’m at the store getting food and stuff, even though they are all the way back at home.” The patient reports that when he logs onto his ipad to play video games, “I can tell that some of the other characters of the game are my parents pretending to be other people. They are trying to get into my head.” The patient reports over the past 3 weeks he has stopped eating dinner, remains withdrawn to his room, and keeps the shades drawn “because I don’t want them looking into my windows.” The patient denied any other similar periods of symptoms like this in the past, denied illicit substance use (patients urine toxicology returns negative of all substance), and denied recent head injury or seizure. He denied active thoughts, plans or intents of harm to self or others. There are no guns in the home. About halfway through the exam, that patient grabs his jacket and runs out of the doctors office stating “forget it, I can tell you are working with my parents to kill me too.",

         "A black male in his early 20s with a remote history of depression as an adolescent and current cannabis use presented following an assault while incarcerated. He was found unconscious with mental status changes and brought to the hospital. Initial examination and work-up revealed right-sided periorbital edema and ecchymosis. The patient was arousable to noxious stimuli but would quickly return to sleep and was not interactive during multiple examination attempts. The emergency department staff believed there was a volitional component to his lack of participation in the exam, as he would push away from providers as they examined him or lie unresponsive. At one point, the patient was able to ambulate briefly while in the emergency department (although he ran into several objects) and tolerated an oral intake challenge with juice. Over the course of 5 days, the patient was returned to the emergency department by the facility four more times due to concerns that his mental status was not improving. The facility reported the patient was unable to attend to his ADLs. He was seen to be withdrawn, not eating or drinking, and toileting on himself or the floor. Additionally, guards (as he was incarcerated for part of his hospital admission) reported that he would occasionally speak to family members and staff. However, when he was offered paperwork to sign himself out of jail with an ankle monitor, he only gazed at the officer without speaking.\n\nUrine toxicology was positive for THC and a negative blood alcohol level. He was found to have ketones consistent with starvation ketosis. Lumbar puncture revealed CSF cell count with six total nucleated cells present, <2,000 RBC, 54 mg/dL glucose, and 39 mg/dL protein. Meningitis/encephalitis panel for 14 common viral and bacterial pathogens and antibody testing for West Nile Virus was negative. CT of the head showed no fractures of the face/vertebra and was negative for other acute findings. EEG was read as consistent with a normal drowsy state. MRI of the brain, both with and without contrast, showed a cerebellar developmental venous anomaly but no acute findings. A neurology consult was obtained. His neurologic exam was noted to be variable, with poor participation despite repeated prompting, making full examination difficult. He responded to pain equally in all extremities, demonstrated no abnormal movements, had 2+ reflexes symmetrically, and normal pupillary response. Neurology ultimately felt that his LP, MRI, and EEG were unremarkable, and his symptomatology could be explained by postconcussive symptoms.\n\nOnce the patient was admitted, he was initially treated with a trial of Modafinil for suspected postconcussive syndrome, to which there was no response. On Day 6 of his hospitalization, when the psychiatric consultation service reconsidered his disordered behavior, psychomotor retardation, and speech with consideration for the presence of catatonia, the question of “volitional” inactivity took on a new meaning. There were numerous catatonia signs present to variable degrees: mutism, decreased oral intake, negativism, withdrawal, and decreased spontaneous movement. No automatic obedience, ambitendency, or rigidity was appreciated. ",

         "A 12-year-old male with no specific birth or medical history became concerned about lower abdominal distention and began reducing his food intake 3 months prior to consultation. He exercised obsessively according to his food intake. Although he was considerably losing weight, he commented that his belly was fat and did not want it to get any fatter. Body image disturbances and anxiety regarding being overweight were observed. During his initial consultation, he was very lean, with a body mass index (BMI) of 11.5 kg/m2. He also had sinus bradycardia with a heart rate of approximately 40 beats/min. We attempted to improve his weight with enteral nutritional supplements while identifying underlying diseases by head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and abdominal ultrasound. However, he became disoriented and was emergently hospitalized 7 days after his first visit. On admission, he was 145 cm tall, weighed 20.9 kg (BMI: 9.9 kg/m2), and presented with impaired consciousness with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) E3V4M6, bradycardia with a heart rate of about 40 beats/min, and slow breathing with a respiratory rate of about 10 cycles/min. Blood gas analysis and blood test revealed hypercapnia, hypoglycemia, and elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and transaminases. His movements were slow but not paralytic and his cranial nerves were normal. ",

         "We report on a 35-year-old female with a history of schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, and cocaine use disorder, with multiple previous psychiatric admissions, who was brought to our hospital's crisis unit after her parents called police, complaining that she had become aggressive and was “acting delusional” during an argument. According to her parents, the patient had demanded a DNA test to prove that her parents were not her biological parents and that her son was not her biological son. One week prior to admission, the patient's parents had reported her missing when she “disappeared” from their home soon after being discharged from our hospital following a similar presentation. Prior to admission, the patient's medications included lamotrigine, clonazepam, and long-acting injectable aripiprazole; however, her adherence to treatment recommendations was poor.\n\nAlthough her parents claimed that she resided with them and her 2-year-old son, the patient endorsed a recent history of homelessness lasting several months. The patient said that during this period of homelessness, she had been sexually assaulted by a stranger in his hotel room. Collateral revealed that per court order, the patient's continued custody of her son was contingent on her adherence to psychotropic medications and inpatient drug rehabilitation. The patient admitted to using recreational drugs frequently over the past 6 months, including crack cocaine, which she stated she had used during the 1-week interval between hospitalizations.\n\nDuring her initial mental status examination, the patient was poorly groomed, uncooperative, intrusive, and irritable. Her speech was pressured, and she described her recent sleep as poor. She commented that she intended to become pregnant and to sell the baby to an agency for $6,000. She made religious statements about “being fruitful and multiplying” and admitted to recently engaging in hypersexual behavior, explaining that “I have boyfriends on the streets.” She underwent testing for sexually transmitted infections, with reassuring results. She declined voluntary inpatient psychiatric admission and was subsequently screened and committed. We discontinued clonazepam at the time of admission, and we restarted the patient on lamotrigine, adding oral aripiprazole to supplement her long-acting injectable aripiprazole.\n\nDuring her hospitalization, the patient faced several barriers to efficient psychiatric stabilization. First among these was her insistence on refusing any medications that might cause weight gain, including olanzapine. She endorsed allergies to haloperidol, risperidone, lurasidone, and lithium, with symptoms such as “anxiety,” “eye rolling,” and “facial twitching” in response to these drugs. Because she was adherent to oral lamotrigine and aripiprazole, we chose not to seek treatment over objection to administer a stronger antipsychotic medication that would also serve as an effective mood stabilizer. On hospital Day 4, the patient appeared virtually in family court, where she received an ultimatum to cooperate with treatment recommendations in order to maintain custody of her son. Nonetheless, she remained adamant about not being placed on “weight gainers,” stating that “I can have nine more babies. I want to be sexy.” On hospital Day 6, she tested positive for COVID-19 and was quarantined for 10 days on a medical floor. Her respiratory symptoms included cough and rhinorrhea, and she continued to display manic symptoms, including elated affect, hyperverbality, grandiosity, religious preoccupation, and inappropriate laughter. She exhibited behaviors suggestive of sexual preoccupation, such as raising her shirt during interviews to reveal a protuberant abdomen and repeatedly endorsing a desire to “stay sexy.”\n\nAfter her quarantine, the patient returned to the psychiatric unit with her manic symptoms unresolved. On hospital Day 17, she requested a pregnancy test due to concerns that she might have become pregnant because she “had sex with a bunch of guys because I was homeless.” The patient seemed reassured when we explained that her admission pregnancy test was negative. We ordered a new quantitative β-hCG test, which was likewise negative. On Day 18, the patient received a maintenance dose of long-acting injectable aripiprazole. On Day 19, she complained of abdominal and back pain, stating “I've been in labor since last night.” She elaborated that “I can feel the head in my crotch” and “when I lay on my back, I feel the little hands and feet.” She also stated that her “water broke” and her “mucus plug broke.” The patient exhibited several physical signs and symptoms of pregnancy, including a distended abdomen, intermittent “pulsating” bilateral lower abdominal cramps, and sensations of fetal movement. In addition, she endorsed amenorrhea for the past year, except for some “mild spotting” three weeks previously. Convinced that her two recent pregnancy tests were “false negatives” and frustrated that members of the treatment team did not believe she was pregnant, she threatened to sue the hospital for failing to provide obstetric care. The patient lamented that “you all think I'm crazy, but I'm actually pregnant.” At this time, she displayed an intensifying religious preoccupation and stated that she was able to communicate with angels and “see Jesus.” She proclaimed that she herself was a prophet who could interpret the “auras” of hospital staff.\n\nThe patient agreed to a pelvic exam, which revealed a distended, nontender abdomen. The uterus was nongravid. The patient received acetaminophen and heating pads, and we ordered a transabdominal ultrasound to better assess the etiology of her abdominal pain and in the hopes of resolving her condition via additional evidence of nonpregnancy. At this time, the patient began to refuse all previously prescribed medications because she believed these would harm her “baby.” She did, however, agree to begin fluphenazine elixir, which we prescribed to address worsening psychosis.\n\nWhen she arrived in the ultrasound suite, the patient offered the radiology technologist four million dollars “if you get this baby right.” She became euphoric while viewing the ultrasound monitor, exclaiming “That's a head, and that's a penis!” Her speech was pressured, and she perseverated on religious themes, requesting that all non-Christian staff leave the suite and instructing staff to “resist the Devil and he will flee from you!” She also demonstrated sexual preoccupation, recalling an experience in which she had “danced after I had sex” and exclaiming about the size of her “baby's penis,” predicting that he would be “sexy like his daddy.” After the procedure, the patient happily told fellow patients that she would soon deliver another child. She said, “I have been having contractions for 19 hr. When the results come back and they find out I am not crazy, they will finally send me to maternity.”\n\nAn on-call psychiatry resident presented the radiology report to the patient on hospital Day 20. She emphatically refuted the report, articulating a persecutory delusion of a conspiracy waged against her by the treatment team. She stated that the radiologist must have been “paid off” to switch her ultrasound with that of another patient. She continued to refuse medications that she felt might harm her “baby”; however, she agreed to an increase in her dose of fluphenazine. Following this dose increase, her affect remained labile, with frequent swings between euphoria and irritability, but she ceased making comments indicative of religious and sexual preoccupation. As our hospital is a short-term care facility, we decided to refer the patient to a higher level of care facility. On the day of her discharge, the patient told a nurse that “I don't think I'm pregnant anymore; it's all the shit I have inside me,” referring to her constipated bowels.",

         "The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a psychiatric history of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), major depressive disorder (MDD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), dyssomnia, tobacco use disorder, and alcohol use disorder in remission. Her tobacco use disorder began at age 22, and she smoked two packs of cigarettes daily. At age 46, she decreased her tobacco use to smoking one and a half packs of cigarettes daily. Two years later, she further decreased her tobacco use to smoking one pack of cigarettes daily.\n\nHer alcohol use disorder began at age 38, and she drank a pint (473 mL) of hard liquor daily. At age 45, she decreased her alcohol use to half a pint (236.5 mL) of hard liquor daily. The following year, she decreased her alcohol use to only weekends. Two years later, she used alcohol very occasionally. At age 49, her husband passed, and her alcohol use increased to a fifth (750 mL) of gin daily. She was hospitalized twice that year for chronic pancreatitis and quit drinking after the second hospitalization.\n\nShe struggled with worsening GAD, MDD, and PTSD since age 39. At age 46, she was prescribed citalopram but did not tolerate it. At age 49, she began regularly seeing outpatient psychiatry. She was prescribed sertraline and prazosin. A few months later, her MDD and PTSD symptoms significantly improved. However, her GAD worsened, and she had more frequent exacerbations. Her sertraline and prazosin dosages were increased. She was also prescribed hydroxyzine but did not tolerate it. Additionally, she received grief therapy as recommended. Her MDD and PTSD symptoms improved significantly more, but her GAD continued to be uncontrolled. Intermittently, she would be out of her medications, and her MDD and GAD would worsen. Her PTSD was stable, even when out of medication.\n\nAlso, the patient was prescribed melatonin for her dyssomnia at age 50. Her dyssomnia was uncontrolled despite increasing the melatonin dosage. She did not tolerate trazodone. The patient was then lost to follow-up with outpatient psychiatry for 2 years and returned at age 53. Since then, she has had regular follow-up appointments with outpatient psychiatry.\n\nWhen she returned to outpatient psychiatry at age 53, she had been off of all psychiatric medications. Her MDD was partially stable. Her PTSD was stable. Her GAD and dyssomnia were uncontrolled. She had resumed drinking small amounts of alcohol on occasion, about once a month, and she continued to smoke one pack of cigarettes daily. Her sertraline was resumed, and she was started on zolpidem. Her dyssomnia improved with zolpidem. Eventually, her sertraline was switched to paroxetine. After trialing multiple medications, she was started on diazepam for a short period for her uncontrolled anxiety. Psychotherapy was also recommended, but she did not take part in it. In April 2020, at age 55, her outpatient psychiatry appointments were converted from in-person to telehealth due to COVID-19 health regulations.\n\nAt age 49, the patient first noted fatigue and poor memory. At a follow-up appointment a few months later, she continued to report poor memory. A year later, she reported worsening memory, resulting in losing her keys and forgetting important dates. After that, she did not report fatigue or memory concerns for several years.\n\nIn August 2021, at age 56, the patient had mild COVID-19, which did not require hospitalization. Since then, for a period of over 1.5 years, she has reported persistent symptoms associated with LC-19. At her following appointment in December 2021, she noted fatigue, breathlessness, ageusia, poor appetite, weight loss, and “not feeling right.” In January 2022, she also reported poor memory, increased confusion, and being easily distracted. She was concerned she had an unnoticed stroke that was causing these symptoms. In February 2022, these symptoms persisted, and she reported left-side weakness. In April 2022, she also reported anosmia, “brain fog,” and feeling disorganized. She stated she could not describe her cognitive symptoms with words. In August 2022, she also reported generalized weakness, loss of balance, dizziness, body temperature changes, and increased disorganization. She stated she couldn't go to walk-in psychotherapy due to her disorganization.\n\nAt this time, she also began experiencing significant impairments in her daily functioning. She reported difficulties with instrumental activities of daily living, such as cooking. In September 2022, she also reported trouble with word finding. In October 2022, she also reported concern regarding her sensation of touch and vision. She reported that things felt different, and she thought her vision “easily missed things.” For example, she would not have initially seen a trash bag and would suddenly notice it was there. In January 2023, she also expressed feeling unable to drive, although once she was in the car, she could complete the task. In March 2023, she noted not being able to feel her left hand and believed she may have had a stroke to cause this. Other than fatigue and difficulty with memory, the patient did not express any of these symptoms or concerns prior to August 2021.\n\nHer social isolation, due to her symptoms, further exacerbated her distress. She reported excessive anxiety regarding the uncertain etiology of her symptoms. She frequently expressed concern that her physicians were not doing enough to diagnose and treat her. She requested a comprehensive work-up and hospital admission. She did not meet the criteria for hospital admission and was not admitted.",

         "The patient is a 20-year-old single man. He is unemployed and has a history of polysubstance abuse and family problems. For the past 2 years, he has used alcohol, cocaine, and medical substance (Lyrica and other medications). He has a history of social anxiety with biological symptoms, which are unresponsive to medication. He expressed low self esteem and feelings of worthlessness. He was pessimistic about the future, saying, “I don't see anything ahead for me.” He described a passive death wish, but denied having any active suicidal thoughts. He described feeling fast heartbeats, blushing, trembling, sweating, trouble catching his breath, dizziness, and panic complaints, especially when talking to people and women in specific. He also described being unable to carry out a conversation with others, feelings of being watched and laughed at, and believing that he is ugly looking. He described having these complaints since adolescence. The patient has been an addict for the past 2 years. He started with Marijuana and alcohol, and then he tried several medical drugs.\nThe patient talked about various upsetting memories of instances that took place during his childhood and up to his late teenage years. This included memories, such as not being given a choice or participating in decision making, his father's absence from the house due to travel, followed by the discovery of his marriage to another woman and the presence of children. His family's upbringing style is firm, authoritarian on the part of the mother, and permissive on the part of the father.",
