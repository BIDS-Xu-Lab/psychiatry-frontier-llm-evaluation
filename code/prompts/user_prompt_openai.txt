Please provide a structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses for the following case vignette enclosed between the <vignette> and </vignette> tags. Base your answer only on the information provided and your clinical expertise; do not fabricate additional details. Give the top 5 most likely diagnoses with corresponding ICD-10 F-codes, consisting of the primary diagnosis and 4 secondary diagnoses with corresponding ICD-10 F-codes. Do not include non-psychiatric diagnoses that do not use F-codes. Your response should consist only of the diagnoses and corresponding F-codes.

Follow this formatting:
1. <Primary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code
2. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code
3. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code
4. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code
5. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code

As you are building the differential diagnosis, follow the below clinical reasoning rubric taken from the ACGME Psychiatry Milestones, which evaluates psychiatry resident physician performance. The rubric is enclosed between <rubric> and </rubric>. This rubric contains two subcompetencies - Patient Care 1: Psychiatric Evaluation and Patient Care 2: Psychiatric Formulation and Differential Diagnosis. You should perform at Level 5 for both, representing an expert resident whose achievements in a subcompetency are greater than the expectation. Do not output any of your clinical reasoning; only output the structured list of diagnoses.

<rubric>
Patient Care 1: Psychiatric Evaluation
Overall Intent: To gather and organize findings from the patient interview; mental status and cognitive exams; targeted physical and neurologic exams; data from collateral sources including information gathered from the medical record, family members, other treaters; and laboratory and imaging results; to screen for risk, and integrate risk assessment into the patient evaluation.
Level 1: Collects general medical and psychiatric history and completes a mental status examination. Collects relevant information from collateral
sources. Screens for risk of harm to self, to others, or by others.
Level 2: Efficiently acquires an accurate and relevant history and performs a targeted examination customized to the patient's presentation. Selects appropriate laboratory and diagnostic tests. Engages in a basic risk assessment and basic safety planning.
Level 3: Uses hypothesis-driven information gathering to obtain complete, accurate, and relevant history. Interprets collateral information and test
results to determine necessary additional steps. Incorporates risk and
protective factors into the assessment of imminent, short, and long-term patient safety and the safety of others.
Level 4: Elicits and observes subtle and unusual findings. Interprets collateral information and test results to determine necessary additional steps in the evaluation of complex conditions. Incorporates risk and protective factors into the assessment of complex patient presentations, including eliciting information not readily offered by the patient.
Level 5: Serves as a role model for gathering subtle and accurate findings from the patient and collateral sources. Serves as a role model for risk assessment.

Patient Care 2: Psychiatric Formulation and Differential Diagnosis
Overall Intent: To organize and summarize findings and generate differential diagnosis; identify contributing factors and contextual features and creates a formulation, and use the emotional responses of clinician and patient as diagnostic information.
Level 1: Organizes and accurately summarizes information obtained from the patient evaluation to develop a clinical impression. Recognizes that biological, psychosocial, and developmental/life cycle factors play a role in a patient’s presentation. Recognizes that clinicians have emotional responses to patients.
Level 2: Integrates information from the most relevant sources to develop a basic differential diagnosis for common patient presentations. Identifies the biological, psychosocial, and developmental/life cycle factors that contribute to a patient’s presentation. Recognizes that clinicians’ emotional responses have diagnostic value.
Level 3: Develops a thorough and prioritized differential diagnosis while avoiding premature closure for a range of patient presentations. Synthesizes all information into a concise but comprehensive formulation, taking into account biological, psychosocial, and developmental/life cycle factors. Begins to use the clinician's emotional responses to the patient to aid formulation.
Level 4: Develops differential diagnoses in complex cases and incorporates subtle, unusual, or conflicting findings. Develops formulations based on multiple conceptual models. Integrates clinician’s and patient’s emotional responses into the diagnosis and formulation.
Level 5: Serves as a role model in the development of accurate and complete differential diagnoses and formulations.
