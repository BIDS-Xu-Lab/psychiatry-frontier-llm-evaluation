    "vignette":"Terry Najarian, a 65-year-old salesman for a large corporation, presented for a psychiatric evaluation after his wife threatened to leave him. Although he said he was embarrassed to discuss his issues with a stranger, he described his sexual interest in women\u2019s undergarments in a quite matter-of-fact manner. This interest had surfaced several years earlier and had not been a problem until he was caught masturbating by his wife 6 weeks prior to the evaluation. Upon seeing him dressed in panties and a bra, she initially \u201cwent nuts,\u201d thinking he was having an affair. After he clarified that he was not seeing anyone else, she \u201cshut him out\u201d and hardly spoke to him. When they argued, she called him a \u201cpervert\u201d and made it clear that she was considering divorce unless he \u201cgot help.\u201d\n\nMr. Najarian\u2019s habit began in the setting of his wife\u2019s severe arthritis and likely depression, both of which significantly reduced her overall activity level and specifically her interest in sex. His \u201cfetish\u201d was the bright spot during his frequent and otherwise dreary business trips. He also masturbated at home but generally waited until his wife was out of the house. His specific pattern was to masturbate about twice weekly, using bras and panties that he had collected over several years. He said that intercourse with his wife had faded to \u201cevery month or two\u201d but was mutually satisfying.\n\nThe patient had been married for over 30 years, and the couple had two grown children. Mr. Najarian had planned to retire comfortably later that year, but not if the two choices were either \u201cto be poor after we split the assets or to sit around the house all day and be called a pervert.\u201d\n\nHe became visibly anxious when discussing his marital difficulties. He described some recent difficulty falling asleep and \u201cworried constantly\u201d about his marriage but denied other psychiatric problems. He had made a show of throwing away a half dozen pieces of underwear, which had seemed to reassure his wife, but he had saved his \u201cfavorites\u201d and \u201ccould always buy more.\u201d He said he was of mixed mind. He did not want to end his marriage, but he saw nothing harmful in his new mode of masturbating. \u201cI\u2019m not unfaithful or doing anything bad,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just excites me, and my wife certainly doesn\u2019t want to be having sex a few times a week.\u201d\n\nMr. Najarian denied any difficulties related to sexual functioning, adding that he could maintain erections and achieve orgasm without women\u2019s undergarments. He recalled being aroused when he touched women\u2019s underwear as a teenager and had masturbated repeatedly to that experience. That fantasy had disappeared when he became sexually active with his wife. He denied any personal or family history of mental illness.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Here's how I arrived at the diagnoses for Mr. Najarian:**\n\nI began by meticulously reviewing the case vignette, focusing on the patient's presenting concerns, history, and observations. The key issues that stood out to me were his recurrent cross-dressing for sexual arousal (transvestic interest), and the anxiety and distress stemming from his wife's reaction to this behavior. My process involved a careful application of DSM-5-TR criteria, weighing the evidence for each potential diagnosis. I considered the differential between Transvestic Disorder and Fetishistic Disorder, given his history of both collecting and wearing women's underwear. Ultimately, the emphasis on the cross-dressing aspect in the vignette led me to prioritize Transvestic Disorder as the primary diagnosis. The associated anxiety and insomnia prompted a diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety. I considered Fetishistic Disorder given his past arousal through touch and collecting items, and I included a more general \"Other Specified Paraphilic Disorder\" to capture any nuances not fully captured by the other categories. Finally, I included Unspecified Anxiety Disorder to fully encompass the persistent and generalized anxiety if the adjustment disorder wasn't the sole explanation. I double-checked the ICD-10 codes to ensure accuracy and made sure to organize my findings into the required format. My goal was to provide a concise and clinically sound differential diagnosis list reflecting the patient's presentation.\n\n\n",

    "vignette":"A 27-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of convulsions.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 2 years before this admission, when shaking of the trunk, arms, and legs occurred. The episode lasted approximately 4 to 5 minutes and had been preceded by a sharp pain in the back of the head that radiated to the neck, blurred vision, palpitations, nausea, and difficulty concentrating. The patient did not seek evaluation, and no additional convulsive episodes occurred during the subsequent 20 months.\nFour months before this admission, while the patient was drinking alcohol at a party, his body suddenly became stiff, and he fell backward onto a table. Shaking of the trunk, arms, and legs occurred for approximately 5 to 8 minutes. He had urinary incontinence but did not bite his tongue. Five minutes later, similar convulsions occurred. The patient was taken to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. The results of computed tomography of the head were normal, as was an electroencephalogram (EEG) that was obtained over a period of 40 minutes. Treatment with levetiracetam was started. The patient was discharged home with a recommendation for follow-up evaluation at the neurology clinic of the other hospital.\nThree months before this admission, the patient was evaluated at the neurology clinic of the other hospital. He reported that despite the use of levetiracetam, convulsions occurred approximately once per week. The results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, were reportedly normal. Treatment with lamotrigine was started. There was no change in the quality or frequency of the convulsive episodes.\nOne month before this admission, while the patient was at work, his colleagues found him on the floor, and they witnessed \u201cshaking and clenching\u201d movements of the trunk, arms, and legs that lasted approximately 2 minutes. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was taken to the emergency department of a second hospital for evaluation.\nAt least two additional convulsive episodes occurred at the second hospital. During one episode, the shaking movements became less intense when the physician\u2019s hand was placed on the patient\u2019s shoulder; the movements resumed at the previous intensity when the hand was removed. In addition, the patient\u2019s eyes were closed. When the eyelids were opened manually, no nystagmus or gaze deviation was present. When the eyelids were released, the eyes shut forcefully and Bell\u2019s phenomenon (upward deviation of the eyes when closing) occurred. The patient did not speak but was able to follow simple verbal commands, such as an instruction to squeeze the physician\u2019s hands. In between the convulsive episodes, there were intermittent rocking movements of the upper body and nonrhythmic tremulous movements of the hands, and the patient did not speak or follow commands. After several hours, the episodes stopped, and the patient was able to speak. Admission to the hospital was recommended; however, the patient declined because of work obligations and anxiety about being in the hospital. He was discharged home.\nDuring the subsequent month, the patient continued to take levetiracetam and lamotrigine. However, the convulsions increased in frequency to one to three times per week.\nOn the morning before the current admission, while the patient was at work, his colleagues noticed that he abruptly stopped speaking and began to have shaking movements of the arms and legs. Emergency medical services were called. On their arrival, the patient\u2019s body was stiff, and there was twitching of the trunk, arms, and legs. No urinary or fecal incontinence or biting of the tongue had occurred. The patient was able to stand up from a chair and walk to the ambulance. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 111\/56 mm Hg, the pulse 83 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was awake and alert but did not speak. His eyes were open, with a primary midline gaze and blinking in response to visual threat. His body appeared stiff, with the arms and legs straightened. There were intermittent nonrhythmic tremulous movements of the trunk, arms, and legs. The patient was able to follow complex commands and to move the arms and legs symmetrically and against gravity, but there was a delay in motor activation. The deep-tendon reflexes were normal. Extensive scarring from burns was present on the face, trunk, back, arms, and legs.\nApproximately 45 minutes after the tremulous movements had stopped, the patient was able to speak but with limited fluency. Additional history was obtained. He had been taking levetiracetam and lamotrigine as directed; however, 3 days before this evaluation, he had stopped taking these medications because he was unsure whether they were effective. That morning, he had felt well until he noticed a sharp pain in the back of his head that radiated to his neck, along with sudden blurred vision, full-body numbness, and difficulty concentrating. A convulsive episode then occurred that lasted up to 20 minutes; during the episode, the patient was aware of events but sometimes had difficulty hearing. He described his overall mood as \u201cpretty good\u201d and did not report decreased energy or chronic fatigue. There was no history of psychotic or manic symptoms, suicidal ideation, or obsessive or compulsive behaviors.\nThe patient had a history of a febrile seizure in childhood, as well as several concussions that had occurred while he was playing sports in childhood. He reported that during the first 6 years of life, his social supports were limited, and he had experienced maltreatment by a family member; he did not elaborate on the nature of the maltreatment. In late childhood, he was involved in a house fire and hospitalized for a prolonged period because of severe burns on the face, body, arms, and legs. He had asthma, major depressive disorder, chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and panic disorder with agoraphobia. He took escitalopram daily and lorazepam as needed for panic attacks. He was in a long-term romantic relationship. He did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs; he smoked marijuana approximately once per year and drank one alcoholic beverage per week. His father had died of heart disease when the patient was a teenager; his mother had schizoaffective disorder and post-traumatic epilepsy.\nBlood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The blood lactate level was 2.4 mmol per liter (22 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.2 mmol per liter [5 to 20 mg per deciliter]) and the blood creatine kinase level 489 U per liter (reference range, 60 to 400). Serum and urine toxicologic panels were negative. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was admitted to this hospital.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Here's how I'm thinking about this patient:**\n\nOkay, so I'm an expert psychiatrist here to make a diagnosis based on this information. The goal is to use high-level clinical reasoning and give a structured list of the top five diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes. No reasoning in the final output, just codes.\n\nI'm starting by carefully reviewing the patient's information. It's a 27-year-old man who's been having \"convulsions.\" The initial episode had those somatic symptoms and lasted 4-5 minutes, with no loss of consciousness. The second episode, possibly triggered by alcohol, was more intense. Despite medication (AEDs), the episodes have gotten more frequent. There's witness accounts of the episodes where he was \"shaking and clenching\", but also that he could follow simple commands, which is unusual for a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Plus, the fact he can walk right after the event. His medical history shows childhood febrile seizures, concussions, and a significant history of trauma. This patient has a pretty rough history - severe maltreatment, a house fire with burns. He's diagnosed with asthma, Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Chronic Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia. His mother also has schizoaffective disorder and post-traumatic epilepsy. His labs were mostly normal, but with a mild lactate and CK elevation, which makes sense given the shaking.\n\nNow, I'm analyzing the clinical picture closely. The presentation of these \"seizures\" is classic for Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder, specifically with attacks or seizures (formerly psychogenic non-epileptic seizures). The evidence is mounting: preserved awareness, fluctuating nature, distractibility, eye closure, non-rhythmic movements, lack of response to AEDs, rapid recovery and that really strong trauma history. This is screaming FNSD at me.\n\nSince the prompt asks for *all* relevant psychiatric diagnoses, my primary diagnosis is clearly Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder (FNSD), or conversion disorder with seizures. The comorbidity list is also important: PTSD from the childhood trauma is a huge factor. He definitely meets criteria for Panic Disorder, and the Agoraphobia diagnosis fits with that. He also has Major Depressive Disorder, which has been chronic.\n\nI'm thinking about what to rule out. Epilepsy seems unlikely because of the semiology - preserved awareness, eye closure and distractibility. Also, his normal EEG's support this and the fact that AEDs have no effect. I also need to rule out things like malingering or Factitious disorder, but there's no evidence of external incentive. I see a history of trauma here so FNSD seems the most accurate, classic diagnosis.\n\nTime to refine my diagnoses and select those F-codes. For FNSD, I'm going with F44.5 (Conversion disorder with attacks or seizures). For PTSD, I'm choosing F43.12 (Chronic). For Panic Disorder, I'm using F41.0. The Agoraphobia gets F40.00. I also need to code the MDD - Since it is a history, and he is doing \u201cpretty good\u201d currently, I\u2019m leaning towards F33.42 (Major depressive disorder, recurrent, in full remission) or F33.9. Since I am unsure of the patient\u2019s exact status right now, but do know he has a history of MDD, I will use F32.9 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified) for MDD.\n\nAfter going over my diagnoses and codes, everything checks out. The diagnoses are all supported by the information and they're all F-codes.\n\nMy final list is:\n1.  F44.5: Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder (Conversion Disorder)\n2.  F43.12: Chronic Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)\n3.  F41.0: Panic Disorder\n4.  F40.00: Agoraphobia\n5.  F32.9: Major Depressive Disorder\n\nThis all feels right and thorough. That should be a clear and accurate diagnosis list.\n\n\n",

    "vignette":"Only upon the repeated and fervent insistence of her parents did 19-year-old Emily reluctantly agree to see a psychiatrist. \u201cIt\u2019s not me you want to see,\u201d Emily proclaimed emphatically. \u201cIt\u2019s my insane parents who need your help.\u201d Emily did not offer a chief complaint, aside from the concern that her parents were driving her \u201ccrazy.\u201d She added, \u201cEverything is going great in my life. I have plenty of friends, go out almost every night, and always have lots of fun.\u201d\n\nWhile Emily was taking some time away from \u201cthe so-called real world,\u201d her sister was attending Duke University, her younger brother was excelling at a competitive private high school, and both her parents seemed to enjoy their careers as radiologists. She asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s enough strivers for one family?\u201d\n\nEmily agreed to have her parents join the session, and they told a different story. They tearfully disclosed that their daughter had become irritable, unproductive, and oppositional. She drank to intoxication almost every night, often not returning home for an entire weekend. In searching her room, they had found small amounts of marijuana, alprazolam (Xanax), cocaine, and prescription stimulants. The parents described the changes in Emily\u2019s personality as \u201can adolescent nightmare\u201d and described her friends as \u201closers who do nothing but dye their hair, get tattoos, and hate everything.\u201d Emily\u2019s attitudes and behavior contrasted markedly with those of her parents and siblings. \u201cWe don\u2019t mind that she is doing her own thing and that she isn\u2019t conservative like the rest of us,\u201d her father said, \u201cbut it\u2019s like we don\u2019t even recognize who she\u2019s become.\u201d\n\nAccording to her parents, Emily\u2019s \u201cadolescent nightmare\u201d began 4 years earlier. She had apparently been a studious 15-year-old girl with a lively sense of humor and a wide circle of \u201cterrific friends.\u201d \u201cAlmost overnight,\u201d she began to shun her longtime friends in favor of \u201cdropouts and malcontents\u201d and began to accumulate traffic tickets and school detentions. Instead of her former bright-eyed curiosity, Emily manifested a lack of interest in all her academic subjects, and her grades dropped from As to Ds. The parents were at an absolute loss to explain the sudden and dramatic change.\n\nThe abrupt change in performance led the psychiatrist to ask Emily to take a battery of neuropsychological tests so the results could be compared with those of tests that she had taken when she had applied to a private high school several years earlier. In particular, Emily retook two high school admissions tests: the System for Assessment and Group Evaluation (SAGE), which measures a broad array of academic and perceptual aptitudes, and the Differential Aptitude Tests (DAT), which focus on reasoning, spelling, and perceptual skills.\n\nOn the SAGE, her average percentile scores dropped from the upper 10% for a 13-year-old to the bottom 10% for an adult (and the bottom 20% for a 13-year-old). When Emily took the DAT at age 13, she scored in the highest range for ninth graders across almost all measures. Her worst result had been in spelling, where she scored at the second-highest level. Upon repeating the test at age 19, she scored below the high school average in all measures.\n\nEEG, brain CT, and T2-weighted brain MRI scans showed no evidence of structural brain damage. However, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) T2-weighted MRI displayed a clear lesion in the left frontal cortex, highly suggestive of previous injury to that region.\n\nUpon further questioning about the crucial period in which she seemed to have changed, Emily admitted to being in a traffic accident with her now ex-boyfriend, Mark. Although Emily did not recall much from this episode, she remembered that she hit her head and that she had bad headaches for many weeks thereafter. Because Emily was not bleeding and there was no damage to the car, neither Mark nor Emily reported the incident to anyone. With Emily\u2019s permission, the psychiatrist contacted Mark, who was away at college but a willing and excellent historian. He remembered the incident well. \u201cEmily hit her head very, very hard on the dashboard of my car. She was not totally unconscious but very dazed. For about 3 hours, she spoke very slowly, complained that her head hurt badly, and was confused. For about 2 hours she didn\u2019t know where she was or what day it was. She also threw up twice. I was really scared, but Emily didn\u2019t want me to worry her parents since they\u2019re so overprotective. And then she broke up with me, and we\u2019ve hardly spoken since.\u201d",

    "model_thoughts":"**Expert Diagnosis Formulation - My Thought Process:**\n\nOkay, here we go. I've got to diagnose Emily, and it's a real Level 5 ACGME Psychiatry Milestone situation. The prompt is clear: F-codes only, and prioritize the most likely diagnoses. No explanation, just the list. My head is already racing, pulling up those DSM-5-TR criteria and ICD-10 codes.\n\nFirst, I'm digging into this clinical vignette. 19-year-old, forced to come in, denying problems \u2013 classic resistance, but I'm looking at what her parents are reporting. Irritable, unproductive, substance use, drastic personality change, and academic decline. That's a lot of red flags. The timeline is key \u2013 four years ago, \"almost overnight.\" Premorbid, she was doing well. Now, neuropsych testing shows a massive decline. And then, the *crucial finding*: the FLAIR T2 MRI shows a clear lesion in her left frontal cortex \u2013 it is the key.\n\nThis leads me to think about a major neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury. The ex-boyfriend confirming an MVA at 15 is a critical piece. Concussion, headaches, vomiting, amnesia \u2013 definitely points to TBI. And the fact that the onset aligns with the incident is crucial. The frontal lobe lesion on MRI, personality change, and cognitive decline... it fits perfectly.\n\nBut what about the substance use? Are the drugs the *cause*, or the result of something else? The cognitive decline *followed* the TBI, so it must be the primary condition. The substance use is probably a behavioral disturbance related to the TBI. So the next step is the differential: TBI as a primary diagnosis and the other issues are secondary.\n\nMy mind automatically checks all the other possibilities. Personality change due to another medical condition? That's definitely on the table, but with such a significant cognitive decline, I have to go with Major NCD. Mood disorders? The irritability could be a mood issue, but the sudden onset and neuropsych data suggest something else.\n\nI will focus on ICD codes. F02.81 is the primary code. Substance use is significant and needs to be addressed \u2013 Alcohol, stimulants, Xanax, marijuana. These are all disorders. The coding guide is helpful: \u201cCode first the medical condition (TBI codes) then F02.81.\u201d But the prompt asks for F-codes only.\n\nI think of Polysubstance Use Disorder, but it's best to be specific if you have the data. In this case, \"alcohol almost every night\" is obvious. Given the other substances were found at her place, it is possible she is not meeting the full use disorder criteria, but I have to assess whether they are meeting the criteria, given the impact on her life. Given the situation, it would be reckless not to list those as separate disorders.\n\nFinally, a quick final check for any other conditions. The \"adolescent nightmare\" is not a separate diagnosis; it is behavioral disturbance. It's time to refine the list to get to the five diagnoses.\n1. Major NCD. F02.81.\n2. Alcohol Use Disorder (F10.20)\n3. Cannabis Use Disorder (F12.20)\n4. Sedative Use Disorder (Xanax) (F13.20)\n5. Stimulant Use Disorder (F15.20)\n\nLet's verify!\nDSM-5-TR: TBI -> F02.81. Done.\nAlcohol, cannabis, and Sedatives \u2013 yes. Now Stimulant Disorder with cocaine and prescription stimulants - F15 or F14. F15 to be more comprehensive. Done.

    "vignette":"Lucas Sandahl, a 32-year-old landscape architect, presented to a psychiatrist for help with anger. He came to the office with his wife, the mother of their two young children. The couple agreed that Mr. Sandahl had become \u201calmost impossible to live with.\u201d Mrs. Sandahl reported that although she had always considered her husband \u201chigh-strung,\u201d his outbursts were increasing in both frequency and intensity, and she worried that he would become violent with her.\n\nTheir most recent argument began when Mr. Sandahl came home after a \u201chard day at work\u201d to find that dinner was not ready. When he entered the kitchen and saw his wife sitting at the table reading the newspaper, he \u201cexploded\u201d and launched into a tirade about how \u201cbad\u201d a wife she was. When Mrs. Sandahl tried to explain her own long day, Mr. Sandahl cursed at her and broke glassware and a kitchen chair. Terrified, she ran out of the kitchen, gathered up the toddlers, and left for her mother\u2019s house a few miles away. The next day, she told her husband that he would need to get help immediately or prepare for a divorce.\n\nMr. Sandahl said his \u201cblowups\u201d began in childhood but did not become \u201cproblematic\u201d for him until age 13. At about that time, he started having frequent fights with classmates that would occasionally result in trips to the principal\u2019s office. In between the altercations, he was active socially and a solid student.\n\nMr. Sandahl estimated that he had had approximately four verbal outbursts a week in recent years, generally in response to frustration, unexpected demands, or perceived insults. In addition to these heated verbal tussles, Mr. Sandahl described acts of violence about every 2 months; for example, he threw a computer monitor across the room when it started \u201cacting up,\u201d he kicked a hole in a wall when one of his children would not quit crying, and he destroyed his mobile phone during an argument with his mother. He denied physical fights since his adolescence, although he had nearly come to blows with a neighbor as well as an assortment of strangers and employees. The idea that he might physically hurt someone scared Mr. Sandahl \u201cto the core.\u201d\n\nThese outbursts blighted his relationships with colleagues and romantic partners and led to his decision to start his own landscaping company at age 25. The business had done well, despite his demanding style and \u201chair-trigger\u201d temper that led to high employee turnover.\n\nMr. Sandahl described the episodes as short-lived, reaching a peak within seconds and rarely lasting more than a few minutes. Between episodes, he described himself as feeling \u201cfine.\u201d He had experienced brief periods of depressed mood and increased anxiety, but these had not impaired him significantly and tended to resolve on their own within a week. Mr. Sandahl drank socially, but neither he nor his wife linked the outbursts to the alcohol. He had a history of experimentation with various drugs of abuse, but not in recent years.\n\nMr. Sandahl reported at least two other immediate family members with significant \u201canger issues.\u201d His father was emotionally abusive and perfectionistic, expecting \u201cgreat things\u201d from his only son. Mr. Sandahl\u2019s older sister also had problems with her temper; he attributed her three divorces to her emotionally abusive behavior.\n\nOn examination, Mr. Sandahl was casually dressed, cooperative, and coherent. He was worried about his behavior and contrite toward his wife. He denied depression, psychosis, and confusion. He denied any thoughts of hurting himself or others. He was cognitively intact.

    "model_thoughts":"**Diagnosis Formulation: My Expert Thinking**\n\nOkay, here's how I'd approach this. First, I need to wear my expert psychiatrist hat and ensure I'm formulating this diagnosis at the Level 5 Milestones level, which means I have to be incredibly thorough, consider complex factors, rule out possibilities, and present a prioritized list. The prompt gives me a structured format, so I know to focus on the top 5 diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes, no reasoning needed in the final output.\n\nI start by thoroughly examining the information. Mr. Sandahl presents with a clear chief complaint: anger, being \"impossible to live with,\" and a fear of violence from his wife. The history paints a picture of recurrent, explosive outbursts \u2013 both verbal and physical, disproportionate to the triggers. I note the rapid onset, short duration of the episodes, and that he's \"fine\" in between. The developmental history shows problems starting in childhood. Crucially, I have to consider the family history, which suggests a possible genetic predisposition for impulsivity or learned behavior. I review the review of systems. I quickly rule out major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and substance-induced issues based on the specifics. Cognition is intact.\n\nNow, I move on to my diagnostic reasoning. Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) seems to be the main contender. I go through each criterion, comparing them to Mr. Sandahl's clinical presentation. His outbursts certainly meet the frequency criteria. The magnitude of his aggression (breaking things, yelling) is grossly out of proportion to the triggers. These are not premeditated actions but are \u201chair-trigger\u201d. The distress and impairment are obvious in the marital issues, job turnover, and near fights. All of this fits together nicely.\n\nThen I must analyze the alternative diagnoses to see whether there's a better explanation. Bipolar is out because the outbursts aren\u2019t linked to a distinct manic episode. Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder doesn\u2019t apply because of his age and the absence of constant irritability. Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) is less likely because of the remorse. I give BPD close consideration but the vignette does not have enough evidence for it. I also consider ADHD, given the impulsivity, but there's a lack of inattention reported. Substance use is ruled out by the history, both self-report and wife.\n\nSo, I\u2019m confident that IED is the primary diagnosis. With the primary diagnosis locked, I turn to the secondary diagnoses. Brief periods of depression and anxiety are mentioned. Those would need to be captured with \u201cUnspecified Depressive Disorder\u201d and \u201cUnspecified Anxiety Disorder.\u201d The family history and his demanding style make a personality disorder a possibility. Although I don't see enough for a specific personality disorder, so I\u2019d choose Unspecified Personality Disorder. ADHD is a strong consideration, as impulsivity is a major feature of his presentation, even though inattention doesn't seem to be a problem based on the vignette.\n\nNow it's time to prioritize. IED is the clear top choice. The depressive and anxiety symptoms need to be captured. Personality disorder traits need to be captured. In my thinking, I have to provide a differential list, and the ACGME rubric mentions \u201cbiological factors\u201d in Level 5. Given his childhood onset and impulsive nature, ADHD has to be a likely choice.\n\nI go through the codes. I double-check them. I review it. I am completely confident about my choice. The case asks for an F-code for each one of the diagnoses. I give my final answer.\n\n1.  Intermittent explosive disorder - F63.81\n2.  Other specified depressive episodes - F32.89 (to capture the brief depression)\n3.  Unspecified anxiety disorder - F41.9 (for the anxiety)\n4.  Unspecified personality disorder - F60.9 (captures the traits without specifics)\n5.  Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, unspecified type - F90.9 (for a valid differential, given the childhood onset of behavior)\n\nI have checked and double-checked the codes and am ready to submit my top 5 diagnoses.\n\n\n",

    "vignette":"J is a mid-20s military service member living independently in the community with a partner. J has a history of multiple ACEs (ACE scale score of 10\/10), with caregivers that were both physically and emotionally abusive when J's needs were voiced, resulting in a belief that it was unacceptable, unsafe, and futile to resolve interpersonal problems with caregivers, thus creating a sense of powerlessness and helplessness. Child and family services were never involved, and no legal charges were ever laid against the family for the abuse that J endured. J struggled with containing anger since early childhood resulting in physical and verbal aggression towards peers and teachers at school and family members at home. Caregivers attempted to contain J's aggressive behavior through forced administration of psychiatric medication. While growing up, J feared others and preferred to be alone, despite longing for family and friends. Socialization with peers proved difficult, as J was easily overwhelmed by noise associated with social contact and was frequently ridiculed or misunderstood while trying to verbally communicate.\n\nAs a young adult, J left family to enter the military, which became an immediate source of attachment and social belonging. More recently, J became increasingly unable to cope with anger following an ill-suited work position and a musculoskeletal injury, resulting in frequent angry verbal altercations and threats of violence towards military peers who placed restrictions on his activities. This led to disciplinary action and isolation from the unit, which further increased anger, hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts and led to a psychiatric military assessment. During the assessment, J disclosed feelings of intense anger which eventually manifested in an attack on a family member in an amnestic dissociated state. J's history indicated that pharmacological treatments had either been ineffective or caused significant side effects. The military psychiatrist determined J ought to be considered for military discharge. This triggered flashbacks of past childhood abuse and a significant increase in rage. J refused trials of psychiatric medications in the community due to a childhood history of forced medication administration. Due to significant safety concerns and limited ability to control aggressive behavior in the community, J's military psychiatrist referred J for an inpatient admission.\n\nOn initial assessment for admission, J appeared distrustful, angry, and concerned about acting out on anger and expressed suicidal ideation. On mental status examination, J was tall and appeared neatly dressed in a military uniform. J appeared hypervigilant and intensely watchful and was well spoken, using a \u201csharp\u201d tone of voice. J provided a detailed history, demonstrating a goal-directed thought form and a high level of abstract thinking, logical analysis, and good recall. There were no delusions or hallucinations, but J endorsed prominent active suicidal ideation, with intent to act upon these thoughts if not hospitalized; however, there were no immediate, specific suicide plans.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Okay, here's my thought process as I've been working through this patient's case. It's really quite complex, but here's how I'm thinking about it.**\n\nFirst, I'm making sure I'm clear on the task and what I need to produce. I'm taking on the role of an expert psychiatrist, and the prompt asks me for the top 5 diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes, no reasoning.\n\nNow, as I start gathering the information, it is crucial to analyze the vignette. I'm focusing on the significant details to put together a picture of the patient, J. We know he's a mid-20s, military service member. His history includes a recent escalation of anger, threats, and a disciplinary action that led to isolation. His suicidal thoughts and flashbacks triggered by discharge are concerning. He has an ACE score of 10\/10, which indicates severe childhood trauma. This suggests significant past abuse and neglect. The MSE reveals distrust, anger, hypervigilance, and active suicidal ideation with intent.\n\nHere's where it gets interesting: I'm developing a differential diagnosis as I think of clusters of symptoms. I'm grouping the symptoms into different clusters to formulate differential diagnoses. For me, the first cluster, **Trauma and Stressor-Related**, really jumps out. The history of severe abuse, flashbacks, hypervigilance, avoidance, negative alterations in cognition and mood, and dissociative symptoms all strongly point toward **Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)**. The \"amnestic dissociated state\" further supports this.\n\nThe second group, the **Personality\/Interpersonal Functioning**, points to **Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)**. The long-standing pattern of anger, difficulty controlling temper, unstable relationships, suicidal ideation, paranoia, and stress-related dissociation all fit the diagnostic criteria. I am also considering **Paranoid Personality Disorder**, given his distrustful and hypervigilant behavior. However, BPD better encompasses the emotional instability. **Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD)** also came to mind due to the aggression, but his longing for connection and reactive aggression make ASPD less likely.\n\nThe third cluster focuses on the **Neurodevelopmental\/Social Communication**. The sensory sensitivity to noise, social communication difficulties, preference for solitude, and high abstract thinking strongly suggest **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)**.\n\nThe fourth cluster is **Mood\/Suicidality**, which points toward **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)**, given the hopelessness and suicidal ideation. \"Hopelessness\" is a key symptom that is being identified. Given the strong trauma and personality context, this mood disorder is either primary or secondary, so an **Unspecified Depressive Disorder** is also being considered.\n\nThe fifth cluster to consider is **Dissociation**. The \"amnestic dissociated state\" requires a diagnosis of **Dissociative Amnesia**.\n\nI now have a list of possible diagnoses to work with. I need to prioritize and refine the list. I'm thinking that PTSD is a strong driver. The severe trauma is central to his presentation. I'm listing ASD as secondary, given the lifelong developmental context that may have also made it hard to thrive in the military. It explains some of the social communication struggles, and why he finds military life hard. BPD also seems to fit, with the emotional dysregulation, fear of abandonment, suicidality, and stress-related paranoia. MDD needs to be considered, given the hopelessness. And, the *very specific* mention of the \"amnestic dissociated state\" during an assault suggests a dissociative process. I feel comfortable with including all five diagnoses.\n\nI am finalizing the diagnoses with the F-codes that I identified, with PTSD as my primary, followed by ASD, then BPD, MDD, and Dissociative Amnesia as my fifth.\n\n\n",

    "model_thoughts":"**Internal Review of Diagnostic Formulation**\n\nOkay, here's my thought process. First, I need to analyze this request carefully. I'm an experienced psychiatrist, and my task is to diagnose this patient, a 12-month-old named Ben, based on a clinical vignette. I'm operating under specific constraints: I have to follow the ACGME Psychiatry Milestones, specifically demonstrating Level 5 reasoning in the Evaluation and Formulation category, but I cannot *show* that reasoning explicitly. My output must be a numbered list of the top five most likely DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses with their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes. It's crucial that I only use the provided information, and I can't include any non-psychiatric diagnoses. The format has to be a numbered list. No clinical reasoning is allowed in my final answer, only the diagnoses themselves.\n\nNext, I need to thoroughly dissect the clinical vignette. Ben is presenting for a well-check, and his father is concerned about physical differences and behavioral issues, particularly crying. I note some striking physical anomalies: hypertelorism, low-set ears, microcephaly, micrognathia, and diffuse hypotonia. His medical history is also significant: low birth weight, a NICU stay, a possible congenital heart defect (likely ASD or VSD), feeding difficulties, and excessive drooling. Behaviorally, he has a high-pitched \"cat-like\" cry, separation anxiety (crying loudly when left alone), and clear developmental delays suggested by the hypotonia, feeding issues, and physical stigmata at 12 months. Genetic testing is pending.\n\nThe key feature that jumps out is the \"cat-like cry.\" Combined with the microcephaly, hypertelorism, low-set ears, micrognathia, hypotonia, and potential heart defect, this strongly suggests Cri-du-chat syndrome (5p-). I know I can't directly list this genetic diagnosis, but it forms the foundation of my psychiatric formulation.\n\nNow, I'm thinking about the DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses. Since Ben is 12 months old, and because his symptoms are widespread and cannot be reliably assessed, my primary diagnosis is **Global Developmental Delay (F88)**. He has hypotonia, feeding issues, and microcephaly, suggesting significant developmental delay.\n\nThe vignette mentions that Ben cries loudly if left alone. This may or may not be pathological at 12 months. At this age, some degree of separation anxiety is normal. However, the *intensity* described, combined with the other features of the syndrome, raises the question of whether it's an appropriate and disproportionate amount of anxiety. So, I will include **Separation Anxiety Disorder of Childhood (F93.0)** as a potential differential.\n\nBen's feeding difficulties are explicitly mentioned. He sees a GI specialist for \"problems related to feeding.\" Hypotonicity often causes feeding difficulties, but this isn't necessarily a psychiatric problem. Still, feeding disorders are common in this population. Without further information, I need to include **Avoidant\/restrictive food intake disorder (F50.82)** in the differential, as it addresses significant feeding disturbance.\n\nGiven that I'm dealing with a known genetic condition (even though it's not named), DSM-5-TR allows for a diagnosis related to an associated medical condition. The behavioral manifestations likely stem from that, so I'll include **Unspecified mental disorder due to another medical condition (F06.9)**. This allows me to capture the behavioral sequelae of the genetic syndrome.\n\nFinally, because Ben's overall symptoms don't perfectly fit into one specific category, and to acknowledge the broader nature of his deficits, I will also include **Unspecified neurodevelopmental disorder (F89)**. I know this is a catch-all, but it is useful when criteria for a specific diagnosis aren't fully met, or when there is a known etiology impacting the neurodevelopment.\n\nI double-checked all the ICD-10 codes to ensure I'm using the most accurate ones based on DSM-5-TR. I thought about whether Autism Spectrum Disorder was a consideration, but it's too early for a definitive diagnosis without more evidence. I considered an Adjustment Disorder, but that's unlikely in an infant with congenital issues.\n\nWith all of this in mind, the final list, which I have reviewed multiple times, is as follows:\n\n1.  Global developmental delay - F88\n2.  Avoidant\/restrictive food intake disorder - F50.82\n3.  Separation anxiety disorder of childhood - F93.0\n4.  Unspecified mental disorder due to another medical condition - F06.9\n5.  Unspecified neurodevelopmental disorder - F89\n\n\n",

    "vignette":"Olivia Jacobs, a 22-year-old graduate student in architecture, was referred for an urgent psychiatric consultation after she told her roommate that she was suicidal. Ms. Jacobs had a history of mood symptoms that had been under good control with lithium and sertraline, but her depressive symptoms had returned soon after she had arrived in a new city for school, 3 months earlier. She had become preoccupied with ways in which she might kill herself without inconveniencing others. Her dominant suicidal thoughts involved shooting herself in the head while leaning out the window, so as not to cause a mess in the dorm. Although she did not have access to a gun, she spent time searching the Web for places where she might purchase one.\n\nMs. Jacobs\u2019s psychiatric history began at age 15, when she began to regularly drink alcohol and smoke marijuana, usually when out at dance clubs with friends. Both of these substances calmed her, and she denied that either had become problematic. She had used neither alcohol nor marijuana since starting graduate school.\n\nAround age 17, she began experiencing brief, intense depressive episodes, marked by tearfulness, feelings of guilt, anhedonia, hopelessness, low energy, and poor concentration. She would sleep more than 12 hours a day and neglect responsibilities at school and home.\n\nThese depressive episodes would generally shift after a few weeks into periods of increased energy, pressured speech, and unusual creativity. She would stay up most of the night working on projects and building architectural models. These revved-up episodes lasted about 5 days and were punctuated by feelings that her friends had turned against her and that they were not really friends at all. Worried especially about the paranoia, her family had brought her to a psychiatrist, who diagnosed her as having bipolar II disorder and prescribed lithium and sertraline. Although Ms. Jacobs\u2019s moods did not completely stabilize on this regimen, she did well enough at a local university to be accepted into a prestigious graduate program far from home. At that point the depression returned, and she became intensely suicidal for the first time.\n\nUpon evaluation, the patient was visibly depressed and tearful, and had psychomotor slowing. She said it was very difficult to get out of bed and she was not attending class most days. She reported hopelessness, poor concentration, and guilt about spending family money for school when she was not able to perform. She stated that she thought about suicide most of the time and that she had found nothing to distract her. She denied recent drinking or smoking marijuana, stating she did not feel like \u201cpartying.\u201d She acknowledged profound feelings of emptiness and indicated that she had occasionally cut her arms superficially to \u201csee what it would feel like.\u201d She stated that she knew that cutting herself in this way would not kill her. She reported depersonalization and occasional panic attacks. She denied having mood instability, derealization, problems with impulsivity, concerns about her identity, and fears of abandonment.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Diagnostic Formulation and Differential:**\n\nOkay, here's my thought process. I need to nail this, and I'm going in with a full expert toolkit. First, this Olivia Jacobs case screams Bipolar II Disorder. The cyclical nature is clear: major depressive episodes, and a 5-day \u201crevved-up\u201d episode that sounds like hypomania. The history of prior diagnosis and good functioning (getting into grad school) despite mood swings, along with the symptom duration of 5 days, all point to Bipolar II as the primary diagnosis. The \u201cparanoia\u201d is a tricky one; it could sway us to Bipolar I if it's full-blown psychosis, but given her previous diagnosis and the context, I'm leaning toward interpreting it as part of hypomanic irritability or overvalued ideation. The current presentation is a classic major depressive episode. Bipolar II, Current Episode Depressed - that's the anchor.\n\nNow, what else? Well, the history of substance use is key. She started using alcohol and marijuana young, and those habits seem to be what calmed her down. She denies current use, but the past use pattern is clinically significant, even in remission. I'll diagnose Alcohol Use Disorder (mild, in early remission) and Cannabis Use Disorder (also mild, in early remission) to reflect the history and risk.\n\nNext, the anxiety. She has \"occasional panic attacks.\" That's enough to consider Panic Disorder, especially given her current vulnerable state. I'll include that. I'm also noting the depersonalization - she admits to it, and that's an important symptom cluster. Given the presence of the attacks and depersonalization, I'll also add depersonalization\/derealization disorder or unspecified dissociative disorder.\n\nNow, should I include a personality disorder? She has emptiness and cutting. While the vignette mentions those BPD features, the author seems to be steering me *away* from a BPD diagnosis with her specific denials of key BPD criteria. The prompt specifies this is a *differential* diagnostic list, and BPD may be what you need to *exclude*. I'll note those features but not make BPD a primary, or even a secondary, diagnosis, in my final list. Given the denials, and that cutting can be a symptom of severe depression, it should be listed in any notes but is not high on the list.\n\nThe suicidal ideation is, of course, critical, but there's no F-code for it. So I don't list it directly. It\u2019s part of the major depressive episode.\n\nIn the end, my top five diagnoses are:\n\n1.  **Bipolar II Disorder, current episode depressed (F31.81)** - the core.\n2.  **Alcohol Use Disorder, in early remission (F10.11 or F10.21)**. F10.11 is better.\n3.  **Cannabis Use Disorder, in early remission (F12.11)**.\n4.  **Panic Disorder (F41.0)** - Given the \"occasional attacks\". *Anxiety Disorder Unspecified (F41.9)* is a thought if I want to be *extra* conservative about the attacks.\n5.  **Depersonalization-derealization disorder (F48.1)** - Because it's a clear symptom.\n\n\n",

    "model_thoughts":"**Final Diagnostic Impression and Rationale:**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking based on this clinical vignette. This is a complex case, and it's crucial to get it right, keeping in mind the patient's age, history, and the specific request for ICD-10 F-codes. I\u2019m operating at a Level 5 ACGME milestone, meaning I'm not just applying criteria but integrating a comprehensive understanding of the patient within a complex clinical context.\n\nFirst, the core presentation is overwhelmingly consistent with **Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (F34.81)**. The recurrent temper outbursts (slapping, throwing objects, fighting) that happen multiple times a week are clear. Critically, the guardian reports general irritability, which is the key differentiator for DMDD over something like Intermittent Explosive Disorder. Given her age, 10, this also fits well.\n\nNext, I'm noting the physical aggression. \"Fights\" and \"hitting kids\" are prominent features. While the irritability is the dominant mood picture, the physical aggression pushes me towards **Conduct Disorder, Childhood-onset type (F91.1)**. I am compelled to diagnose CD given these aggressive behaviors, despite the fact that in a 10yo, there would be a tendency to diagnose DMDD or ODD, if it wasn't for the DSM-5-TR requirement to provide the diagnoses and to meet the request to provide 5.\n\nFurthermore, given the patient is a ward of the state and has been returned from multiple foster families, the history screams trauma. The irritability, outbursts, emotional lability \u2013 these are all classic presentations of **Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (F43.10)**, particularly in children who have experienced disrupted attachment and instability. This history must be understood as an important factor in the etiology of her presentation.\n\nWith those things in mind, the impulsivity and interrupting behavior are suggestive of **Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder, Combined presentation (F90.2)**, which is very commonly comorbid with both DMDD and CD, and the level of comorbidity requires this diagnosis.\n\nFinally, while the child's aggression and irritability are central, I can't ignore the expressed anxiety in the form of fear of the hospital setting and begging to go home. So, I will include **Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9)** as the 5th diagnosis. This captures her general distress without specifying a particular anxiety disorder, such as Separation Anxiety. I considered Separation Anxiety, but it's not the *best* fit based on the limited information in the vignette.\n\nTherefore, my final list of diagnoses, formatted as requested, is:\n\n1.  Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder - F34.81\n2.  Conduct Disorder, Childhood-onset type - F91.1\n3.  Posttraumatic Stress Disorder - F43.10\n4.  Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder, Combined presentation - F90.2\n5.

The patient frequently punches her mother in the legs, and in the stomach, and the patient even threw her ipad at the pediatrician when she asked the patient what was upsetting her. Most of the patients psychiatric history is gathered from her mother, given how irritable the patient is during the exam. The mother reports Neveah was born 8 weeks pre-mature, spent about 1 month in the neonatal intensive care unit due to problems with breathing, and ultimately discharged home to her care at one month of age.

    "model_thoughts":"**Okay, let's break this down.** The task at hand is to meticulously analyze Neveah's case and arrive at the five most likely DSM-5-TR diagnoses, presented in a structured list. My thought process will mirror that of a seasoned psychiatric resident, using evidence from the vignette and applying differential diagnostic reasoning.\n\nFirst and foremost, **Bipolar I Disorder** seems the most probable diagnosis. The classic features of mania are present: decreased need for sleep (3 hours!), pressured speech (\"talking fast\"), grandiosity (\"super powers\"), psychomotor agitation, and mood instability with periods of irritability that last for weeks. The fact that she required hospitalization at 13 due to these episodes strengthens the diagnosis.  While depressive episodes aren't explicitly mentioned, their absence doesn't rule out Bipolar I. The severity of her behavior now, especially the violence, supports this.\n\nHowever, given her age (14) and the presentation of irritability, **Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD)** is a crucial differential. The chronic irritability and frequent temper outbursts are concerning, but the episodic nature of her symptoms, with periods of normal mood, leans *against* DMDD. According to DSM, DMDD can't coexist with a Bipolar diagnosis. However, in this differential list, I need to include it as a strong consideration in case the \"superpowers\" were misconstrued.\n\nNext up, **Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)** is another likely contender. Neveah's restlessness and difficulty with redirection suggest possible ADHD symptoms. It is frequently seen alongside Bipolar, or can be a misdiagnosis during manic episodes. The combined presentation fits.\n\nThe concerning behavior with physical aggression and property destruction is strongly indicative of **Conduct Disorder**.  The fact that she punched her pregnant mother and threw an iPad (potentially as a weapon) is the most concerning sign. This suggests CD or ODD.\n\nFinally, while the aggressive behaviors could be due to mania,  **Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD)** is a possibility to be noted, and the DSM-5 rubric calls to have it included. Since her irritability is the main problem, the DSM-5 criteria indicate ODD.\n\nWhile it is tempting to diagnose IED, Substance Induced, or Unspecified Bipolar, the core evidence points towards these 5 more specific diagnoses.\n\n\n",
    "model_diagnosis":"Based on the clinical vignette and applying the reasoning of an expert psychiatry resident, here are the top 5 most likely diagnoses. The primary diagnosis is Bipolar I Disorder due to the presence of distinct episodes of mania (elevated\/irritable mood, decreased need for sleep, grandiosity\/delusions, pressured speech) lasting several weeks, separated by periods of euthymia, which distinguishes it from the chronic irritability of DMDD or the pervasive instability of personality disorders.\n\n1. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features - F31.2\n2. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder - F34.81\n3. Conduct disorder, adolescent-onset type - F91.2\n4.

    "vignette":"Ashley, age 17, was referred for a diagnostic reevaluation after having carried diagnoses of autism and intellectual disability for almost all of her life. She was recently found to have Kleefstra syndrome, and the family wanted to reconfirm the earlier diagnoses and assess the genetic risk to the future children of her older sisters.\n\nAt the time of the reevaluation, Ashley was attending a special school with a focus on functional skills. She was able to dress herself, but she was not able to shower independently or be left alone in the house. She was able to decode (e.g., read words) and spell at a second-grade level but understood little of what she read. Changes to her schedule and heightened functional expectations tended to make her irritable. When upset, Ashley would often hurt herself (e.g., biting her wrist) and others (e.g., pinching and hair pulling).\n\nIn formal testing done at the time of the reevaluation, Ashley had a nonverbal IQ of 39 and a verbal IQ of 23, with a full scale IQ of 31. Her adaptive scores were somewhat higher, with an overall score of 42 (with 100 as average).\n\nBy history, Ashley first received services at age 9 months after her parents noticed significant motor delays. She walked at 20 months and was toilet trained at 5 years. She spoke her first word at age 6. She received a diagnosis of developmental delay at age 3 and of autism, obesity, and static encephalopathy at age 4. An early evaluation noted possible facial dysmorphology; genetic tests at that time were noncontributory.\n\nHer parents indicated that Ashley knew hundreds of single words and many simple phrases. She had long been very interested in license plates and would draw them for hours. Her strongest skill was memory, and she could draw precise representations of license plates from different states. Ashley had always been very attached to her parents and sisters, and although affectionate toward babies, she showed minimal interest in other teenagers.\n\nAshley\u2019s family history was pertinent for a father with dyslexia, a paternal uncle with epilepsy, and a maternal male cousin with possible \u201cAsperger\u2019s syndrome.\u201d Her siblings, both sisters, were in college and doing well.\n\nOn examination, Ashley was an overweight young woman who made inconsistent eye contact but often peered out the corner of her eye. She had a beautiful smile and would sometimes laugh to herself, but most of the time her facial expressions were subdued. She did not initiate joint attention by trying to catch another person\u2019s eyes. She frequently ignored what others would say to her. To request a preferred object (e.g., a shiny magazine), Ashley would rock from foot to foot and point. When offered an object (e.g., a small decorated box), she brought it to her nose and lips for inspection. Ashley spoke in a high-pitched voice with unusual intonation. During the interview, she used multiple words and a few short phrases that were somewhat rote but communicative, such as \u201cI want to clean up,\u201d and \u201cDo you have a van?\u201d\n\nIn the months prior to the evaluation, Ashley\u2019s parents noticed that she had become increasingly apathetic. A medical evaluation concluded that urinary tract infections were the most likely cause for her symptoms, but antibiotics seemed only to make her more listless. Further medical evaluation led to more extensive genetic testing, and Ashley was diagnosed with Kleefstra syndrome, a rare genetic defect associated with multiple medical problems, including intellectual developmental disorder. The parents said they were also tested and found to \u201cbe negative.\u201d\n\nThe parents specifically wanted to know whether the genetic testing results affected Ashley\u2019s long-standing diagnoses and access to future services. Furthermore, they wanted to know whether their other two daughters should get tested for their risk of carrying genes for autism, intellectual disability, and\/or Kleefstra syndrome.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Vignette Formulation & Diagnostic Impressions**\n\nOkay, here we go. I've got a 17-year-old with Kleefstra syndrome presenting for diagnostic re-evaluation. My primary concern is providing accurate F-code diagnoses, especially given the recent changes in her presentation. This case is complex, demanding a careful and multi-faceted approach. First, I'm noting the long-standing *Autism Spectrum Disorder* (F84.0). This patient exhibits clear social communication deficits and restricted, repetitive behaviors that meet the diagnostic criteria. Then, given the IQ scores, I'm confident in *Intellectual Developmental Disorder, Severe* (F72) diagnosis, considering both the IQ scores and deficits in adaptive functioning.\n\nNext, the *Stereotypic Movement Disorder* (F98.4) with self-injurious behaviors is significant. The wrist biting and foot-rocking require separate attention from the broader autism picture. This directly impacts her safety and warrants an explicit diagnosis and associated behavioral interventions.\n\nNow, here's where it gets interesting: the \"increasing apathy\" and \"listlessness.\" This can't be brushed off. Given the Kleefstra diagnosis and its associated regression and mood changes, I am going with *Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition* (F06.32). I considered catatonia, but the apathy aligns better with depression in this context.\n\nLastly, I'm noting the significant discrepancy between her verbal and nonverbal skills. Although this is often observed in autism, the gap is so pronounced that I have to include *Language Disorder* (F80.2), specifically a mixed receptive-expressive type. This highlights the patient's strengths and weaknesses for future intervention plans. \n\n\n",

    "vignette":"George Anderson, a 73-year-old married man, was referred to a psychiatrist for an evaluation of depression after screening positive on the Geriatric Depression Scale during a neurology appointment. For most of the 2 years since his diagnosis with Parkinson\u2019s disease, Mr. Anderson had coped well and continued to engage in many of his usual activities. His wife of 49 years noted that 1\u20132 years before developing Parkinson\u2019s disease, Mr. Anderson had become somewhat less enthusiastic and motivated compared with his baseline personality, but not to the point of causing any concern or impairment. The only other neuropsychiatric symptom preceding his Parkinson\u2019s diagnosis was his wife\u2019s report that during the past 5 years he frequently \u201cthrashed about\u201d while asleep.\n\nThree months prior to the referral, however, Mr. Anderson began to decline social invitations from family and friends. He reported that he had withdrawn socially because he had lost pleasure in things that used to excite him, although he denied persistent feelings of sadness or worry. He recognized that he was not his \u201cusual self\u201d and tried, to no avail, to give himself \u201cpep talks.\u201d He had worked as a high school science teacher until retirement at age 67, and reported having learned \u201cthe power of seeing the glass half full\u201d from his students. He felt frustrated that he could not \u201csnap out of it\u201d for the first time in his life but was hopeful about getting professional help. He denied wishing for death, explaining that although he was not afraid of death, he wanted to enjoy life as long as possible. He added, \u201cGod does not give me more than I can handle. I can\u2019t ask for a better family, and I have had a full life.\u201d\n\nOther new symptoms over the prior few months included increasing fatigue, impaired concentration and memory, unintentional weight loss, and sleep-onset insomnia. Further history on his more chronic sleep symptoms revealed that, around 3:00 a.m. or 4:00 a.m. on most nights, Mr. Anderson began violently moving his extremities and moaning as though in distress, all while still seemingly asleep in bed. He often awakened his wife with these movements and occasionally struck her in his sleep. She sometimes used a different bedroom because of this. When he awoke from such an incident, he was coherent and briefly anxious, often reporting that he had been dreaming of swimming or running from something.\n\nHis wife took over driving shortly after his Parkinson\u2019s disease diagnosis, but Mr. Anderson was otherwise independent in activities of daily living such as paying bills and managing his medications. His wife described him as \u201cmaybe a little more forgetful\u201d over the past few years, but neither of them was concerned about this mild memory loss.\n\nPast medical history included prostate cancer (in remission), glaucoma, and gout. Labs from his recent neurology visit were unremarkable, including blood counts, serum chemistries, thyroid function, and vitamin B12 levels. Family psychiatric history was positive only for a granddaughter with ADHD. He denied past problematic substance use and all current substance use except two or three glasses of wine monthly. He denied any previous depressive episodes, psychiatric treatment, or psychiatric evaluations.\n\nOn mental status examination, Mr. Anderson was pleasant, cooperative, and interpersonally engaging. Resting tremor, shuffling gait, hypophonia, and bradykinesia all were evident at mild to moderate levels. He occasionally smiled, but his affect was difficult to fully gauge because of masked facies. He reported his mood as \u201cblah.\u201d There was no evidence of psychosis.\n\nOn cognitive testing, he had some difficulty on the Trail Making Test part B, figure copying, and word-list recall, the latter being helped by category prompts. On a standardized brief cognitive assessment, he scored 25 out of 30 points, which was in the normal range.",

    "model_thoughts":"**My Clinical Reasoning Process for Diagnosing Mr. Anderson:**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm approaching this, thinking aloud as I would in a consult. I start by breaking down the instructions: I'm playing the role of a seasoned psychiatrist, evaluating this vignette, and providing the five most likely diagnoses with the appropriate ICD-10 F-codes. No need for detailed reasoning, just the diagnoses themselves.\n\nFirst, I dive into Mr. Anderson's case. He's a 73-year-old man with Parkinson's, a history of prostate cancer in remission, and some other medical issues. The key complaint is depression, confirmed by the Geriatric Depression Scale. But, importantly, I see that these symptoms aren't appearing out of the blue. There's a 2-year history of Parkinson's, and before that, some subtle apathy and \"thrashing about\" during sleep. The recent onset of severe symptoms (anhedonia, fatigue, sleep problems) correlates with disease progression.\n\nI immediately identify *depressive symptoms* as the presenting issue. Is it a major depressive disorder? An adjustment disorder? Or, and this is crucial given the Parkinson's, *depressive disorder due to another medical condition*?  The DSM-5-TR is clear; if the mood disturbance is the direct result of a medical condition, that diagnosis takes precedence. Parkinson's is known to cause depression, so I'm leaning heavily towards that. I'll consider specifiers based on the severity of the symptoms (anhedonia, weight loss, etc.), likely \"with major depressive-like episode\".\n\nNext, the *sleep disturbance* is screaming RBD (REM Sleep Behavior Disorder). He's acting out dreams, striking his wife, and the history fits: violent movements during REM, alertness upon waking, and dream recall. It's also linked to Parkinson's.  I want to give RBD a spot on the list, but now I've hit my first obstacle. The instructions are strict: *F-codes only*. RBD uses a G-code in ICD-10-CM. I need to make a judgment call here, sticking to the instruction. I'll also consider his complaint of sleep-onset insomnia; that *does* have an F-code (F51.01).\n\nThird, the *cognitive changes*. He's mildly forgetful, has trouble with executive function and visuospatial tasks, but is still mostly independent. I'd definitely consider it *mild neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson's*.  It's subcortical in nature, consistent with PD. The Trails B finding is the executive function issue I am concerned with.\n\nI have to consider the *apathy* that was present before the Parkinson's motor symptoms.  It's subtle, but present.  Apathy is not usually a separate, coded DSM-5 diagnosis. I'm going to note this to the referring provider as this might be the personality change due to the medical condition, it's not the same as the depression.\n\nI now formulate my differential.  An adjustment disorder?  He's frustrated, but his symptoms are more than a typical reaction to life events.  MDD? Ruled out by the medical etiology. I want to check for the anxiety, but it is not significant. I then work to finalize my diagnoses.  The list is as follows:\n\n1.  **Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (Parkinson's)** - F06.32\n2.  **Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (Parkinson's)** - F06.7\n3.  **Insomnia Disorder** - F51.01\n4.  **Personality Change Due to Another Medical Condition (Parkinson's)** - F07.0 (To cover the chronic apathy)\n5. **Other Specified Sleep-Wake Disorder** - F51.8 (To best address the REM Sleep Behavior Disorder issues)\n\nI'm aware that it's clinically inaccurate, however. My dilemma is that RBD (G47.52) should be #5, but the instructions force me to the 5th to pick a reasonable F-code.  I might list Nightmare Disorder. The patient has the nightmares. I want to respect the user's instructions.\n\n\n",

    "vignette":"A psychiatric transplant liaison service was called to evaluate Robert Jennings, a 50-year-old married white man, for a liver transplant in the context of an alcohol use disorder, advanced cirrhosis, and no other prior psychiatric history. Several weeks earlier, he had been hospitalized with acute alcohol-associated hepatitis and diagnosed with end-stage liver disease. Prednisolone 40 mg\/day was prescribed for treatment of the hepatitis. Prior to that hospitalization, he had been unaware that his alcohol consumption was seriously damaging his health and was shocked to learn that he would eventually require a liver transplant. Upon discharge, he began an addiction treatment program that was mandatory for him to be listed for possible transplantation.\n\nOutpatient psychiatric consultation was requested by the transplant team after the patient\u2019s family expressed concern that he had recently become increasingly irritable and anxious and seemed to be having difficulty coping with the requirements for transplantation. Mr. Jennings\u2019s primary care physician had recently prescribed alprazolam 0.5 mg as needed for his anxiety. This was initially helpful, but after several days his family noticed he seemed more irritable, lethargic, and forgetful.\n\nWhen interviewed, the patient said that he had been tired for months prior to the diagnosis and that the fatigue had hampered his ability to work (his job required making deliveries for a shipping firm). Although the diagnosis had been a shock, he said he had left the hospital feeling \u201cgreat, better than I\u2019d felt in years.\u201d For about a week after discharge, he described having enhanced energy and a sense of well-being, but he then began to feel anxious and restless. He slept poorly, unable to concentrate, and worried constantly about his health, finances, and family. He became less engaged with his family and stopped watching movies, normally his favorite pastime.\n\nHe denied having nightmares, flashbacks, avoidant behaviors, or racing thoughts. He also denied low mood, tearfulness, appetite changes, anhedonia, helplessness, hopelessness, or suicidality. He reported that he had started drinking daily 10 years earlier, stating that he enjoyed the taste of beer and liked socializing with friends after work. He developed tolerance to alcohol, needing to consume six to eight drinks per night to achieve the same effect. He described some withdrawal symptoms in the morning but did not drink during work hours; he underwent random testing due to his job as a truck driver. He did miss some family activities, preferring to drink, and this had been a source of marital conflict. He admitted feeling guilty about his alcohol use and its impact on him and his family. He denied using any alcohol since his hospitalization. He admitted to anger over having to undergo addiction counseling and had argued with the transplant team about this requirement. He denied having been an anxious person and considered himself able to handle most of life\u2019s challenges without being overwhelmed. His family confirmed his description of himself and viewed his recent behavior as uncharacteristic.\n\nOn mental status examination, Mr. Jennings was a thin, jaundiced, tired-appearing man. His gait was normal, but he was fidgety while seated. He maintained eye contact and responded appropriately, although he repeatedly made comments like, \u201cSomething isn\u2019t right\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s not all in my head.\u201d His affect was anxious and irritable, and his speech was terse. He appeared distracted but denied confusion and disorientation. He had no delusions or hallucinations. His thoughts were logical and coherent, without disorganization, and there was no latency to his responses. He scored 26 out of 30 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, missing points for recall and serial 7s. He scored in the normal range for Trail Making Test A and B but asked to have the instructions repeated for Trails B.",

First, I'm breaking down the request: Expert psychiatrist, vignette, DSM-5-TR, ACGME Milestones, top 5 diagnoses with F-codes, no reasoning. Got it.\n\nNext, I'm diving into the data: a 50-year-old with serious liver issues, on steroids, and recently prescribed alprazolam. Alarm bells are already going off. The alcohol history screams \"established diagnosis,\" and based on the information, it is severe. The \"feeling great\" after discharge, followed by the current anxiety\/cognitive complaints, is the core of this challenge.\n\nMy initial thought is the Prednisolone. Steroids are notorious for psychiatric side effects. The \"high\" phase makes medication-induced anxiety a prime suspect. Then the cognitive symptoms, \"forgetfulness\" and lethargy, that screams hepatic encephalopathy. The recent benzo Rx makes things worse, a classic indicator of liver issues. This means Hepatic Encephalopathy has to be on the list.\n\nNow, let's build the differential. I need to weigh \"Medication-Induced Anxiety\" versus \"Anxiety Due to a Medical Condition,\" i.e., the steroids versus the liver. Both are likely contributors. The alcohol use disorder history needs to be in there too. Is the cognitive dysfunction delirium, mild NCD, or something else? Likely the \"NCD\" because it's not acute. What about adjustment? Yes, stress of the ESLD is involved, but it's not the primary driver.\n\nThe primary issue right now is anxiety. Since it's linked to the medication, it's medication-induced (steroids), but liver problems can cause anxiety too, so it's a bit complicated. The cognitive component is Mild Neurocognitive Disorder, likely due to HE. I'm thinking F19.180 for now and then I will correct it to F19.980 to capture the steroid effect, and keep alcohol use and adjustment disorder with anxiety in mind.\n\nMy top five will be: 1. Substance\/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder (Prednisolone). 2. Alcohol Use Disorder, Severe, In Early Remission. 3. Mild Neurocognitive Disorder (Hepatic Encephalopathy). 4. Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (Hepatic Encephalopathy). 5. Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety.\n\nSo, let's craft the final output.

    "vignette":"Peter Winters, a 46-year-old married white minister, was referred to the psychiatry outpatient department by his primary care doctor for depressive symptoms and opioid misuse in the setting of chronic right knee pain.\n\nMr. Winters injured his right knee playing basketball 17 months earlier. His mother gave him several tablets of hydrocodone-acetaminophen that she had for back pain, and he found this helpful. When he ran out of the pills and his pain persisted, he went to the emergency room. He was told he had a mild sprain. He was given a 1-month supply of hydrocodone-acetaminophen. He took the pills as prescribed for 1 month, and his pain resolved.\n\nAfter stopping the pills, however, Mr. Winters began to experience a recurrence of the pain in his knee. He saw an orthopedist, who ordered imaging studies and determined that there was no structural damage. Mr. Winters was given another 1-month supply of hydrocodone-acetaminophen. This time, however, he needed to take more than prescribed in order to ease the pain. He also felt dysphoric and \u201cachy\u201d when he abstained from taking the medication, and described a \u201ccraving\u201d for more opioids. He returned to the orthopedist, who referred him to a pain specialist.\n\nMr. Winters was too embarrassed to go to the pain specialist, believing that his faith and strength should help him overcome the pain. He found it impossible to live without the pain medication, however, because of the pain, dysphoria, and muscle aches when he stopped the medication. He also began to \u201cenjoy the high\u201d and experienced intense craving. He began to frequent emergency rooms to receive more opioids, often lying about the timing and nature of his right knee pain, and even stole pills from his mother on two occasions. He became preoccupied with trying to find more opioids, and his work and home life suffered. He endorsed low mood, especially when contemplating the impact of opioids on his life, but denied any other mood or neurovegetative symptoms. Eventually, he told his primary care doctor about his opioid use and low mood, and that doctor referred him to the outpatient psychiatry clinic.\n\nMr. Winters had a history of two lifetime major depressive episodes that were treated successfully with escitalopram by his primary care doctor. He also had a history of an alcohol use disorder when he was in his 20s. He managed to quit using alcohol on his own after a family intervention. He smoked two packs of cigarettes daily.

    "model_thoughts":"**Diagnostic Reasoning: Peter Winters**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. As an expert psychiatrist, I'm analyzing this clinical vignette, aiming for a structured list of diagnoses with ICD-10 codes. The prompt is clear; I need to provide the top five most likely diagnoses without any reasoning in the final output. Here's my thought process:\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. This is a 46-year-old minister referred for depression and opioid misuse related to chronic knee pain. Okay, I have my starting point. This individual has a history of knee pain, which led to opioid use, and now faces issues of tolerance, withdrawal, and cravings. Behaviorally, it's pretty clear: he\u2019s doctor-shopping, lying, and stealing to obtain opioids, which is a major red flag. There's also some significant functional impairment at home and work. We know he\u2019s had depressive episodes in the past and has a history of alcohol use disorder, which is now in remission. Family history is also relevant; depression in the father and addiction on the mother\u2019s side. Now, looking at the mental status exam, he's cooperative but has brief answers, and he expresses low mood but denies any neurovegetative symptoms aside from these issues, which gives us some significant data.\n\nI'm starting by zeroing in on the *Opioid Use Disorder*. The DSM-5-TR criteria for this are clearly met: larger amounts, persistent desire to cut down, time spent obtaining and using, craving, failure to fulfill obligations, social\/interpersonal problems, and evidence of tolerance and withdrawal. The severity here looks moderate to severe. So, the primary diagnosis is **Opioid Use Disorder, moderate to severe**, with an ICD-10 code of F11.20, Opioid dependence (uncomplicated). While the patient has mood symptoms, given he is currently experiencing \"low mood\" and an affect that is dysphoric, I am using the code for the substance disorder itself.\n\nNext, the *Mood Disorder*. He does have a history of major depressive episodes, and the current presentation includes a low mood. However, the symptoms are likely related to his opioid use. While a diagnosis of *Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent* remains based on his history of two past episodes, let\u2019s be cautious since the prompt specifies this patient denies any mood or neurovegetative symptoms. The mood symptoms here are likely substance-related or withdrawal-related. It's difficult to say if it's a current MDE. Given that, I think diagnosing Substance\/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder is also fair here, but as the prompt asks, I will proceed with his history. For this reason, the history is what I want to proceed with: *Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent* (F33.42 - in remission).\n\nNow, the *Alcohol Use Disorder* history needs to be addressed. It's in remission, so this will be *Alcohol Use Disorder, in sustained remission* (F10.21).\n\nThen, *Tobacco Use*. The two packs a day is significant. It's a clear-cut case of *Tobacco Use Disorder*, and given the level of use, I will assume it's severe (F17.210).\n\nLastly, the somatic component. He's got knee pain that persists despite an orthopedic evaluation, indicating no structural damage. It's the primary driver of this presentation and a *Somatic Symptom Disorder (with predominant pain)* is a likely secondary diagnosis. The ICD-10 code for this is F45.1. The rubric requests a differential, and I can say Opioid-Induced Depressive Disorder is a secondary differential for diagnosis as well. But, since I have already diagnosed an opioid use disorder, this would be redundant to the diagnosis; however, I must include this diagnosis in my top 5.\n\nNow, putting this all together, and keeping in mind the prompt for 5 diagnoses only, in order of clinical prominence (and remembering the referral of \"depressive symptoms\" at the top):\n\n1.  **Opioid Use Disorder, severe** - F11.20\n2.  **Major depressive disorder, recurrent, in full remission** - F33.42\n3.  **Somatic symptom disorder** - F45.1\n4.  **Alcohol use disorder, in remission** - F10.21\n5.  **Tobacco use disorder** - F17.210\n\nI think this covers the main issues and fits the prompt requirements. I am ready for the list to be rendered to the user.\n\n\n",

    "vignette":"The patient is an 18-year-old non-binary college freshman with a complex psychiatric presentation. They report a history of childhood anxiety, perfectionism, and ritualistic self-punishment behaviors starting in the third grade. Currently, their most debilitating symptom is anxiety about \"contaminated air\" when others cough or sneeze, prompting them to cover their face and hold their breath even when the trigger is far away or on television. They engage in checking and counting behaviors based on the number 3, including checking mirrors while driving, locking\/unlocking their car, and tapping their toothbrush. These compulsions are experienced as uncontrollable, with the patient reporting they sometimes modify behaviors (like holding an imaginary door handle in their pocket) when the original compulsion would be disruptive. At approximately age 16, the patient developed anorexia nervosa, restricting their food intake and ultimately requiring intervention from parents and a treatment team. Despite gaining weight under external pressure, the patient continues to restrict eating, has a distinct fear of gaining weight, becoming fat, fasting until dinner, drinking coffee to intentionally upset their stomach. Their BMI currently falls within the normal range. Around the same time their eating disorder developed, the patient experienced depressive symptoms including hopelessness, low motivation, and self-harm behaviors (pulling hair, cutting, punching stomach). They had suicidal ideation during high school, including thoughts of jumping in front of a train and fantasizing about wandering into hallways during a school shooting. Current suicidal thoughts are less frequent and persistent. Current depressive symptoms have been subsyndromal (though not entirely absent) for about 7 months. Specifically, the patient currently denies experiencing depressive symptoms for more than a few hours every couple of weeks but rates their chance of self-harm in the next three months at 50% (suicide attempt chance at 0%). They report minimal alcohol and marijuana use. Notably, the patient expresses resistance to treatment, stating that \"getting better means getting fat\" and feeling they need to \"stay sad for a while longer\".",

    "model_thoughts":"**Here's how I arrived at this list:**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a clinical vignette and tasked with providing a top-5 diagnosis list with ICD-10 codes, like any good psychiatrist.  First, I had to clarify the constraints: this is based on the information *given*, no inventing details, and it's all about sticking to the DSM-5-TR, using Level 5 ACGME Psychiatry Milestones as a guide, even though this exercise only wants the diagnosis list.  \n\nI started by breaking down the patient's symptoms into clusters, focusing on the ones that jump out: anxiety\/compulsions, eating\/body image, mood\/self-harm, and personality factors.  I took a deep dive into each cluster, carefully weighing the evidence.\n\nThe anxiety cluster screamed \"OCD.\" The classic contamination obsession (air!) and the ritualistic compulsions (checking, counting, avoidance) are textbook.  So, F42.2 (Mixed obsessional thoughts and acts) had to be the first diagnosis.\n\nThe eating disorder was more complex.  There's a *clear* history of anorexia nervosa (AN) that required treatment.  Now, the patient is at a \"normal\" BMI, so the question became \"is this atypical AN or AN in partial remission?\"  The continued restriction, intense fear of weight gain, and past history *strongly* suggested AN, even if weight isn't currently low.  Based on the vignette's details, F50.01 (Anorexia Nervosa, Restricting Type) seemed the most accurate, especially since they specifically mentioned the history of AN.\n\nThe mood cluster revealed depressive symptoms, which led to suicidal ideation and self-harm.  While the patient is currently \"subsyndromal,\" the prior Major Depressive Episode (MDE) pointed to Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).  Since the episode wasn't completely gone, F32.4 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, in partial remission) was the code I chose.\n\nThe \"hair pulling\" behavior demanded attention. It sounded ritualistic, not just a stress response.  Given the OCD-spectrum presentation, Trichotillomania (F63.3) was a very fitting diagnosis.\n\nLastly, the patient also had generalized anxiety, perfectionism, and was often anxious. Given the childhood history of anxiety and perfectionism, generalized anxiety disorder (F41.1) completed the list.\n\nIt was tempting to consider Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) due to the self-harm and mood instability, but the vignette didn't provide enough evidence, and the OCD and eating disorder were just so pronounced. I stuck to the most prominent and well-supported diagnoses.\n\n\n",

    "model_thoughts":"**Final Thoughts on Barbara Reiss's Case**\n\nOkay, here's the final breakdown.  I've gone over this thoroughly. I'm operating as an expert, so I'm aiming for the most precise and defensible diagnoses based *solely* on the information provided in this clinical vignette. It\u2019s crucial to remember that this is a differential diagnosis, not a final verdict, based only on the information presented.\n\nMy primary diagnosis is pretty clear: **Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe with psychotic features (F32.3)**.  She\u2019s ticking all the boxes for a major depressive episode, and the delusional content is clearly mood-congruent.  The severity and psychotic features are evident, and I feel confident with this.\n\nNow, as an expert, I'm thinking of other possibilities, so I'm creating a differential diagnosis. Next up, I think we have to consider **Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type (F25.1)**. I'm putting this second because of the psychotic symptoms \u2013 the delusions are present, and this must be on the differential. This helps inform my thinking about the patient's long-term course, especially if the mood improves but the delusions persist.  It's crucial to rule this out over time.\n\nThird, I'm adding **Delusional disorder, persecutory type (F22)**, recognizing that the delusional content could be the primary issue, though I believe it\u2019s secondary to the depression here. It\u2019s part of the structural differential.\n\nFourth, considering the patient\u2019s age and the new onset of such a severe presentation, I have to include **Unspecified bipolar and related disorder (F31.9)** on the list as a rule-out. Agitation in a depressed older patient warrants careful evaluation for any underlying bipolar component, even if the history is negative. I have to rule this out, and this code reflects the uncertainty.\n\nFinally, while it seems minor, I\u2019m including **Alcohol use disorder, mild (F10.10)**. This is to address her increased alcohol use as a coping mechanism, even if it's currently sub-clinical. It's important to acknowledge and monitor this aspect.\nI'm confident in this as a reasonable and thorough clinical interpretation.  I'm ready to move on.\n\n\n",

    "vignette":"Nadine was a 15-year-old girl whose mother brought her for a psychiatric evaluation to help with her long-standing shyness.\n\nAlthough Nadine was initially reluctant to say much about herself, she said she felt constantly tense. She added that the anxiety had been \u201creally bad\u201d for several years and was often accompanied by episodes of dizziness and crying. She was generally unable to speak in any situation outside of her home or school classes. She refused to leave her house alone for fear of being forced to interact with someone. She was especially anxious around other teenagers, but she had also become \u201ctoo nervous\u201d to speak to adult neighbors she had known for years. She said it felt impossible to walk into a restaurant and order from \u201ca stranger at the counter\u201d for fear of being humiliated. She also felt constantly on her guard, needing to avoid the possibility of getting attacked, a strategy that really only worked when she was alone in her home.\n\nNadine tried to conceal her crippling anxiety from her parents, typically telling them that she \u201cjust didn\u2019t feel like\u201d going out. Feeling trapped and incompetent, Nadine said she contemplated suicide \u201call the time.\u201d In the month before her mother finally brought her in for a psychiatric evaluation, Nadine had begun to cut herself on her thighs to \u201cfeel pain and relieve stress.\u201d No one in the family was aware of this development.\n\nNadine had always been \u201cshy\u201d and had been teased at recess since she started kindergarten. The teasing had escalated to outright bullying by the time she was in seventh grade. The bullying took on a cultural\/racially motivated undertone; Nadine and her family were of a different ethnicity than the vast majority of her schoolmates. For 2 years, day after difficult day, Nadine\u2019s peers turned on her \u201clike a snarling wolf pack,\u201d calling her \u201cstupid,\u201d \u201cugly,\u201d and \u201ccrazy.\u201d Not infrequently, one of them would stare at her and tell her she would be better off committing suicide. One girl (the ringleader, as well as a former elementary school chum) hit Nadine on one occasion, giving her a black eye. Nadine did not fight back. This event was witnessed by an adult neighbor, who told Nadine\u2019s mother. When Nadine\u2019s mother asked her about the incident, Nadine denied it, saying she had \u201cfallen\u201d on the street. She did, however, mention to her mother \u201cin passing\u201d that she wanted to switch schools, but her delivery was so offhand that at the time, her mother casually advised against the switch. Nadine suffered on, sobbing herself to sleep most nights and wishing that she would not wake up.\n\nFull of hope and ideas of escape from the bullies and their narrowness, Nadine transferred to a specialty arts high school for ninth grade. Although the bullying ceased, her anxiety symptoms paradoxically worsened. She felt even more unable to venture into public spaces and felt increasingly embarrassed by her inability to develop the sort of independence typical of a 15-year-old. She said she had begun to spend whole weekends \u201ctrapped\u201d in her home and had become scared to even read by herself in the local park. Nadine\u2019s social anxiety had evolved into true agoraphobia. She had nightly nightmares about the bullies in her old school. Her preoccupation with suicide grew.\n\nHer parents had thought she would outgrow being shy and sought psychiatric help for her only after a teacher remarked that her anxiety and social isolation were keeping her from making the sort of grades and doing the sort of extracurricular activities that were necessary to get into a good college.\n\nNadine described her mother as loud, excitable, aggressive, and \u201ca little frightening.\u201d Her father was a successful tax attorney who worked long hours. Nadine described him as shy in social situations (\u201cHe\u2019s more like me\u201d). Nadine said she and her father sometimes joked that the goal of any evening was to avoid tipping the mother into a rage. Nadine added that she \u201cnever wanted to be anything like her mother.\u201d",

    "model_thoughts":"**Diagnosis Refinement: A Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nOkay, so here's how I'm thinking through this, pulling from my expertise and following the prompt's guidelines. First, I break down the task: diagnose this young woman, Nadine, using the DSM-5-TR, with this vignette as my guide. I'm focusing on providing the *diagnoses* only, not the rationale behind them (though, naturally, I'm forming a solid rationale). Level 5 performance means I'm supposed to be at the top of my game, synthesizing information effectively.\n\nI start by thoroughly examining Nadine's presentation. The chief complaint is \"long-standing shyness\" (per Mom). But then, I dig into the *symptoms*: the constant tension, dizziness, the crying, the avoidance, the nightmares, the suicidal thoughts, the inability to speak\u2026 It's a complex picture. My mind immediately begins grouping these symptoms into clusters.\n\nCluster 1 screams \"Social Anxiety\" \u2013 the intense fear of scrutiny, the avoidance of social situations, the history of teasing. The constant fear of humiliation is a clear red flag. However, the next cluster presents a competing diagnosis, that of PTSD. The severe bullying, the physical assault, the ongoing nightmares, and the hypervigilance are pretty clear. The trauma seems to be central here. I make a note of this.\n\nThen, there's Agoraphobia - the homebound status, the fear of open spaces. Is it purely due to the social anxiety, or does this fear of being somewhere that escape could be difficult or help unavailable drive this? This is clearly a case of Agoraphobia, too.\n\nFurther, suicidal ideation, and the cutting point to a possible Major Depressive Disorder. The sadness, the feelings of worthlessness, they're all there. I quickly see this as a possibility for Nadine's mood.\n\nFinally, the Mutism. She cannot speak outside of home or school, not to strangers, or even some acquaintances. I need to differentiate this from Social Anxiety; this looks more like Selective Mutism, which the vignette suggests.\n\nNow, it's time to *synthesize.* My expert judgement kicks in.\n\nSocial Anxiety Disorder is definitely a strong contender, the \"long-standing shyness\" is, indeed, central. But the bullying is severe, and the PTSD features cannot be ignored. The hypervigilance of *attack* feels different from the fear of scrutiny, so I need to account for this.\n\nWith Agoraphobia, I see that is a huge part of the problem. Given the severity of her unwillingness to leave her home alone, I cannot ignore this. This is the fourth key piece of the clinical presentation.\n\nMajor Depressive Disorder is a no-brainer here. Suicidality and NSSI call for immediate attention. I begin to think about the duration of these symptoms.\n\nLastly, selective Mutism. This is a crucial diagnosis.\n\nThe *prioritization* is key. Social Anxiety seems to be the core, the driving force. PTSD, given the severity of the trauma, is a serious co-occurring issue. MDD, with that suicidality, is clearly essential and needs to be addressed now. Agoraphobia makes her dysfunctional, and, finally, Selective Mutism is a significant specific impairment.\n\nI start to double check the criteria fit of each diagnosis, and confirm the ICD-10 F-codes.\n\nFinally, I *refine the list,* weighing other possibilities, and making sure to consider potential comorbidities.\n\nThen, I cross-check those codes one more time to meet those output requirements! The final product is a precise, structured list that delivers the accurate diagnoses.\n\n\n",

First, I'm going to follow the task instructions \u2013 structured diagnoses only, no reasoning in the output. But, internally, I'm applying an expert lens, focusing on ACGME Level 5 competencies.\n\nI analyze the request: Expert psychiatrist, using DSM-5-TR, diagnosing a clinical vignette, and giving the top five diagnoses in the standard format. I'm going to apply a mental sandbox approach.\n\nI break down the vignette: 16F, athlete, high-performance activities, denies depression or anxiety, two mothers, brother, and dog. No trauma. The key is in the behaviors: excessive exercise, severe dietary restriction (<1000 calories), ritualistic eating (3 hours), and calorie counting. Add in the medical symptoms: Amenorrhea, gastric reflux, and constipation. Finally, laxative abuse twice daily.\n\nMy immediate thought is **Anorexia Nervosa (AN)**. Restriction and low weight are the core problems. The laxative use means, per DSM-5-TR, that I have to consider AN Binge-Eating\/Purging Type even if there is no obvious bingeing. The laxative use is the key distinction here.\n\nNow, I look at differentials: **Bulimia Nervosa** is ruled out because there is no clear bingeing, only restriction. **ARFID** is excluded because this isn't about lack of interest, it's about weight control. **Rumination Disorder** is a possibility based on the reflux, but it's not the primary issue. **OSFED** is a fallback if the full AN criteria aren't met. I need to be aware of the \"level 5 subtle finding\" here. *Why does the patient say they take a laxative?* To \"relieve constipation,\" which is classic purging behavior.\n\nI'm thinking: The amenorrhea strongly implies low weight. I don't know the BMI, but the symptoms are too severe to ignore.\n\nHere is the revised thinking after some self correction:\n\n1.  **Anorexia Nervosa, Binge-eating\/purging type:** The laxative abuse clinches it. It may be interpreted as \"for constipation\" but the frequency (twice daily) is abnormal and in the context of the restrictive behavior is purginh. F50.02.\n2.  **Other specified feeding or eating disorder (OSFED):** F50.8 \u2013 This is my safety net, the diagnosis if weight isn't technically \"low enough.\" Atypical Anorexia might be appropriate.\n3.  **Abuse of non-psychoactive substances (laxatives):** F55.2 \u2013 It needs to be coded.\n4.  **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder:** F42.2 \u2013 The eating rituals and gym compulsion are the focus of my attention.\n5.  **Unspecified Anxiety Disorder:** F41.9 - high achiver, somatic symptoms, no admissions of worry\/panic.\n\nIs it **Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID)**?\n\nThe patient engages in 2.5hrs\/day cardio. Not ARFID.\n\nSo, I keep the Top 5. But I can't just slap a DSM-5-TR code. I need to justify my coding. It has to be airtight. Is there any subtle feature that I am missing?\n\nI'm now going to go for my final list, in order:\n\n1. **Anorexia Nervosa, Binge-eating\/purging type** (F50.02). The combination of restriction, laxative abuse (twice daily), and amenorrhea.\n2. **Other specified feeding or eating disorder** (F50.8) - specifically Atypical Anorexia, just in case.\n3. **Abuse of non-psychoactive substances (laxatives)** (F55.2) - it captures the specific risk.\n4. **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder** (F42.2) - the 3-hour eating routine and compulsive exercise schedule.\n5. **Unspecified Anxiety Disorder** (F41.9). The anxious behaviors are manifest (gym, food restriction) even if the patient is denying specific worry.\n\nI feel confident in this. It is a level 5 output.\n\n\n",

Her husband stated that she had been behaving very strangely and that she had become convinced that she had smothered and killed her baby.\n\nHer husband reported that after a normal pregnancy and uncomplicated delivery, Ms. Norman had happily gone home with their first child. On the third day after delivery, however, her mood and affect began to shift rapidly between elation and weepiness. She became irritable and anxious. She slept only an hour a night, even when her baby was asleep. Her behavior became increasingly bizarre, with overactivity and agitation. Her speech was rapid and digressive. Although not previously a religious person, she became convinced that God was speaking through her and that she had special powers that could solve the problems of the world. She told her husband that she could identify evil people by looking into their eyes and had begun to worry that she was surrounded by evil people, including her own mother. Most disturbing for her, whenever she was out of sight of her son, she became totally convinced that she had smothered him, and no one could convince her otherwise.\n\nMs. Norman had a history of three episodes of major depressive disorder in her teens and early 20s. These episodes resolved with psychotherapy and antidepressant medication. She also had a psychiatric admission for mania 3 years prior to the delivery of her child, after a flight from Asia to Europe. Following treatment with antipsychotic medication, she became depressed for several months. Although a diagnosis of bipolar disorder was discussed at this time, she was reluctant to accept this label, attributing the episode to stress and jet lag. She had discontinued the psychiatric medication in anticipation of getting pregnant.\n\nMs. Norman\u2019s own mother had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital shortly after the birth of her first child. This episode was not talked about in the family, and there were few other details. She had no other family history of note.\n\nUntil just before delivery of her child, Ms. Norman had been a highly functional nurse in a renal unit. Her husband was the head of a sales team, and they lived in comfortable social circumstances. She had no history of illicit drug use and, prior to pregnancy, drank only 2 or 3 units of alcohol a week.\n\nOn mental status examination, Ms. Norman wandered around the room, seemingly unable to sit for more than a few moments. She was distractible and overtalkative, and demonstrated flight of ideas, flitting from one subject to another. Her mood was labile. At times she appeared happily euphoric. At other times she was tearful, and she could become quickly irritable when she felt she was not being understood. It was clear that she had a number of delusional beliefs but was unwilling to discuss most of them with the examiner. She did insist that she had already killed her own child, which led to several minutes of tears, but she returned to an edgy euphoria within a few minutes. She denied intent to harm herself or anyone else. She appeared inattentive, with poor concentration, but would not participate in formal cognitive testing.\n\nPhysical examination and laboratory testing results were all within normal limits.",

The goal was to provide a structured list of diagnoses, without explanation. I then carefully analyzed the information: the patient's presentation, history, and relevant lab findings. The core problem was a woman, 6 days postpartum, presenting with symptoms suggestive of mania, psychosis, and severe mood instability.\n\nMy immediate task was to rule out any underlying medical or organic conditions, which were successfully eliminated based on the provided normal labs. This led to focusing on psychiatric diagnoses.\n\nMy thought process focused on key symptom clusters: postpartum onset, manic symptoms (grandiosity, flight of ideas, decreased sleep, agitation), psychotic features (delusions), and mood lability. I considered the differential diagnoses: \"baby blues\" (too mild), MDD (not the current presentation), Brief Psychotic Disorder (possible), Postpartum Psychosis (a syndrome, not a specific diagnosis), and Bipolar I Disorder.\n\nThe history of prior manic episodes heavily favored Bipolar I. The current presentation clearly met manic criteria with psychotic features. I carefully reviewed the DSM-5-TR criteria and ICD-10 codes, confirming the best fit. I then considered other possibilities, making sure to support my rationale:\n\n*   **Brief Psychotic Disorder:** A consideration if the past manic episode was discounted or if the duration of the current manic symptoms was questioned, which it was not.\n*   **Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type:** This was a standard differential for mania with psychosis, but less likely because the psychotic features seemed to be primarily tied to the mood episode.\n*   **Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features:** This was considered because of the patient's history of MDD and the very dark delusional content, but the strong manic features made this less likely.\n*   **Unspecified Bipolar and Related Disorder:** This was reserved as a catch-all if the criteria for full mania were not clearly met or to account for the postpartum presentation.\n*   **Delirium:** While ruled out by the normal labs, it was crucial to consider given the patient's cognitive symptoms.\n\nUltimately, I focused on a top 5 list. Bipolar I, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features was the primary diagnosis. Brief psychotic disorder, schizoaffective disorder, major depressive disorder with psychotic features, and unspecified bipolar and related disorder became the secondary differentials. I then confirmed that the codes matched the diagnoses. I re-evaluated, making sure to stick to standard psychiatric diagnoses based on the provided information, and finalized my list.\n\n\n",

    "vignette":"A 16-year-old boy with no history of psychiatric illness in self or family and no psychoactive substance use presented with a seizure disorder of 5 years' duration. The semiology of the seizure was such that there would be an aura-tingling sensation in limbs, ringing in ears, and fearfulness for less than a minute, followed by focal onset seizure-twisting of the upper limb and head toward left with stiffening and jerky movements of all four limbs with unconsciousness associated with tongue bite, injury due to fall and episodes also occurred during sleep. He would be confused for a few minutes after gaining consciousness, complain of headaches, and would sleep at times. He had stopped going to school for 4 years and would refuse to visit his relatives because of fear of a seizure episode. He was treated with sodium valproate up to 800\u2009mg for a year, 2 years back with irregular follow-ups. As a few episodes of seizure occurred in-between, the family opted for treatment from traditional healers instead of medicine, and he had been noncompliant for a year. For the last 4 months, the frequency had increased to 1\u20133 episodes within a day.\n\nA detailed clinical evaluation was done, and he was diagnosed as a case of focal onset generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizure and advised for baseline blood investigations, EEG, and MRI and was restarted on sodium valproate 300\u2009mg BD with the view of using an adequate dose and optimized to 900\u2009mg in a week. The general physical and systemic examination, blood parameters, and MRI brain were normal. EEG showed slow background activity with sharp and spike-wave complexes in both cerebral hemispheres.\n\nAfter optimizing the dose of valproate, he was seizure-free for 6 days. However, he presented to the emergency department with drowsiness, decreased alertness, lethargy, and drooling of saliva with a serum valproate level of 76\u2009mg\/L. In view of the sedating side effect of sodium valproate, the antiepileptic was changed to tablet LEV 500\u2009mg BD. The drowsiness improved after stopping valproate and starting LEV. On the 2nd day, he started saying that he felt like going crazy. On the fourth day, he was restless, agitated, and tried to run away from the ward with delusion of persecution and auditory hallucination, second person voices commenting.

    "model_thoughts":"**My Diagnostic Reasoning Process**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm approaching this: I'm a seasoned psychiatrist, so I'm used to these clinical vignettes. My goal is to use my expertise to formulate the top diagnoses, sticking to the provided information and using DSM-5-TR criteria.\n\nFirst, I always break down the request. I know the format, the expectations, and the limitations - no fabrication, just diagnoses and codes.\n\nThen, I dive deep into the clinical details. I'm focusing on a 16-year-old boy with a history of seizures, and crucially, what's happening *now*. The seizure history is important, but the acute psychotic symptoms are what I need to address directly. There's a clear temporal relationship between starting Levetiracetam (LEV) and the onset of psychosis, so that's a HUGE clue. The drowsiness before points to Valproate, and now the agitation with LEV.\n\nI start a \"mental sandbox,\" weighing the possibilities: \"LEV Rage\" is a real thing. Post-ictal psychosis? Possible, but the timing is tricky. Valproate withdrawal? Less likely to cause *this* acute of a psychosis. I have to strongly consider \"Forced Normalization\" - it's a known phenomenon. The EEG abnormalities (slow background) might be contributing to the picture, so I have to keep that possibility in mind. I think \"Delirium\" is also relevant, so I need to include that diagnosis to account for the drowsiness-agitation-psychosis cycle.\n\nI quickly rule out things like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder because of the acute onset and clear medication link. Anxiety seems relevant due to the avoidance behavior (agoraphobia), but the primary issue now is the psychosis.\n\nBased on the temporal relationship, *Substance\/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder* seems most accurate as the primary diagnosis. I need to get the ICD-10 code right, though. I know that because it is an antiepileptic drug, it is important to check the \"Other\" categories. The vignette seems to support \"Other Substance\". Is it \"due to the drug\" or \"due to a medical condition\"? Both could be argued. Ultimately, I decide to label the diagnosis as \"Substance\/Medication-Induced\", using F19.951.\n\nNext, the anxiety.  The fear of seizures in public definitely sounds like Agoraphobia (F40.00), not Social Anxiety. The history of school dropout does make me consider Mild Neurocognitive Disorder (F06.7) - given the EEG findings - or Intellectual Disability (F71-F73). However, I have to remember this is a *psychiatric* diagnosis requested.\n\nThe \"Forced Normalization\" concept is tricky. It's a plausible explanation, and it justifies including Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (F06.2) as a secondary diagnosis, even if I'm leaning toward the LEV effect.\n\nValproate toxicity and the agitation need an explanation. I settled on *Substance-Induced Delirium* - F19.921, because the change in meds (washout\/start) could cause this. The non-compliance and traditional healers are a significant part of the story, so I need to include Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions (F54).\n\nI have to order the diagnoses by clinical significance, in case there is any ambiguity. The LEV-induced psychosis is the most immediate concern. Agoraphobia is important but chronic. \"Forced Normalization\" is speculative but clinically useful. The delirium captures the physiological change.\n\nI check and double-check the ICD-10 codes, making sure they fit the diagnostic criteria precisely. F19.951 is correct, F40.00 is good, F06.2 covers the \"another medical condition\" concept. My \"Delirium\" diagnosis is F19.921 (intoxication-related), and F54 rounds it out. I double check the description for F19.921 vs F05 for Delirium, to ensure the code is correct. I settle with F19.921.\n\nFinally, I have to format it, check again, and make sure it reflects the thinking process. This will be the output!\n\n\n",

They describe their living situation as \"overwhelming\" due to parental boundary issues, though they maintain a supportive romantic relationship since 2019. Their psychiatric history includes diagnoses of MDD and GAD at age 15-16, PTSD in 2016 following emotional abuse by high school friends, and ADHD in 2018 (without neuropsychological evaluation). Current medications include Lisdexamfetamine 50mg (since 2018), various supplements, and a contraceptive injection. They previously tried multiple antidepressants (2011-2015) but discontinued each after approximately two weeks due to suicidal ideation and, in one case, motor disturbances. The patient consumes alcohol socially (3-5 drinks monthly) and has been vaping marijuana 1-3 times weekly for three months primarily to aid sleep and manage anxiety. The patient's primary symptoms onset around age 5 with intrusive visualizations of falling down stairs along with perfectionism through rewriting notes until they felt \"just right\". Currently, they experience significant distress when surroundings are not in the \"right spot\", spending up to 12 hours reorganizing belongings without breaks, which would cause severe distress if interrupted. This \"not just right\" feeling impairs their ability to meet deadlines, complete job applications, and fulfill social obligations. They also engage in checking behaviors when packing (counting socks repeatedly, checking for essential items) and experience distressing sexual intrusive thoughts. Additionally, the patient exhibits skin-picking behaviors, spending over an hour picking at ingrown hairs until bleeding, scratching their neck and jaw during conversations, and tearing at cuticles, with symptoms worsening during periods of anxiety. They've attempted to stop by wearing pants constantly but have been unsuccessful. The patient has a significant history of depression with three past suicide attempts (overdoses in 2014, 2015, and 2017) and self-injury through cutting (stopped in 2017). They currently experience passive suicidal ideation, anhedonia, decreased appetite, sleep difficulties, psychomotor agitation, feelings of worthlessness, and concentration problems, though they report 0% chance of self-harm in the next three months. Social anxiety manifests as persistent fear of judgment and rejection, with distressing rumination about social interactions and excessive reassurance-seeking that has cost them friendships. The patient also reported past sexual abuse by a boyfriend for 4-5 months but denied PTSD symptoms. They disclosed a history of binge eating episodes. During the binge, they ate more rapidly than normal and felt disgusted and embarrassed after. After these eating binges, pt fasted for ~3 days. These eating binges occurred <1 time per week, and the patient has not engaged in these behaviors in the past 2 months.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Diagnosis Formulation Process**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. As a seasoned psychiatrist, I'm taking on this clinical vignette with the expectation of achieving Level 5 performance on ACGME milestones \u2013 that means accurate, nuanced diagnoses, and defensible reasoning. The goal is to provide a structured list of the top five diagnoses with the appropriate ICD-10 F-codes, without getting bogged down in lengthy justifications.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The patient is a 24-year-old, gender-fluid individual living at home, a student or unemployed, with some clear issues.  I'm looking for symptoms, relevant history, the timeline of events, and how these symptoms are impacting the patient's daily life.\n\nRight away, the symptoms point toward Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Intrusive visualizations, perfectionism manifested in note-rewriting, distress when things aren\u2019t \"just right,\" and repetitive checking rituals all fit the classic OCD pattern.  This takes up significant time, which I see as a marker of impairment.\n\nNow, skin-picking behavior jumps out.  The description is consistent with Excoriation Disorder, or skin-picking, causing physical damage. The attempt to control with pants (that failed) further supports this diagnosis.\n\nNext, I review the mood symptoms.  A history of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), multiple suicide attempts, and current passive suicidal ideation, anhedonia, and vegetative symptoms are present. Given the severity and recurrence of these episodes, the diagnosis is MDD, Recurrent, Severe, although it needs to be differentiated from a Bipolar Disorder, given the patient's agitation and any prior history of mania, even though the vignette only focuses on depressive symptoms.  I\u2019m noting that some medications may cause akathisia, and that isn't always mania, which is important to consider.\n\nSocial anxiety seems relevant, too. The patient has a persistent fear of judgment, rumination, and seeking reassurance, leading to lost friendships. This warrants a diagnosis of Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia).\n\nNow for eating behaviors. Binge eating with compensatory fasting history is present, suggesting Bulimia Nervosa or Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (OSFED). But the symptoms aren't weekly and haven't happened in the last 2 months.  Since it doesn't quite meet full criteria, I'll need to consider OSFED as a historical diagnosis at best. The important symptoms here, though, are past behaviors that are now resolved.\n\nThere's regular alcohol use (social, low risk) and vaping of marijuana weekly for sleep\/anxiety, but no substance use disorder criteria are clearly met here, making this lower priority.\n\nThere's also a history of ADHD.  The patient was diagnosed in 2018. While I note the concentration problems, it's difficult to separate them from the depression and OCD. They are on a stimulant. Although the mention of the neuropsych evaluation creates some doubt, the active treatment makes this still a relevant clinical entity.\n\nThe vignette mentions a past history of PTSD and sexual abuse. However, the patient denies PTSD symptoms currently.\n\nSynthesizing all of this, let's prioritize the most impactful conditions for diagnosis. The most severe and pervasive is the OCD \u2013 the onset is in childhood, with 12 hours a day of distress. This will be Diagnosis 1, OCD (F42.2). The mixed nature of intrusive thoughts (sexual visualizations) and acts (ordering\/checking) makes F42.2 the appropriate code.\n\nThe second most impactful is MDD. The history of suicide and severe current symptoms warrant the MDD, Recurrent, Severe, diagnosis, coded as F33.2.\n\nNext comes the Excoriation Disorder. It\u2019s daily, causing physical damage and distress, and the patient has tried to stop it. The code is tricky, since the \"expert\" prompt demands F-codes, and the correct ICD-10-CM code is L98.1. However, since the prompt asks for F-codes and this is a psychiatric entity in DSM-5, I'm mapping it to F42 family, in particular F42.4 (as an international standard code, even though it doesn't have an exact match in US billing). If I have to, I could map it to \"Other specified...\" to satisfy the request. I'm going to put this at Diagnosis 3 (F42.4 is ideal). If I can't use this, I can categorize it as F42.8 (Other Specified) or remove it.\n\nThen, there is Social Anxiety Disorder (F40.10) - the significant impact on relationships means this is Diagnosis 4.\n\nFor the fifth diagnosis, the ADHD history and current treatment mean that Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder, Pred\n\n",

    "vignette":"Felicia Allen was a 32-year-old single woman brought to the emergency room (ER) by police after she apparently tried to steal a city bus in Chicago. Because she appeared to be an \u201cemotionally disturbed person,\u201d a psychiatry consultation was requested.\n\nAccording to the police report, Ms. Allen threatened the driver with a knife, took control of the almost empty city bus, and crashed it. A more complete story was elicited from a friend of Ms. Allen\u2019s who had been on the bus but who had not been arrested. According to her, they had boarded the bus on their way to a nearby shopping mall. Ms. Allen became frustrated when the driver refused her dollar bills, instead demanding exact change. She looked in her purse, but instead of finding exact change, she pulled out a kitchen knife that she carried for protection. The driver fled, so she got into the empty seat and drove the bus across the street into a nearby parked car.\n\nOn examination, Ms. Allen was a handcuffed, heavyset young woman with a bandage on her forehead. She fidgeted and rocked back and forth in her chair. She appeared to be mumbling to herself. When asked what she was saying, the patient made momentary eye contact and just repeated, \u201cSorry, sorry.\u201d She did not respond to other questions.\n\nMore information was elicited from a psychiatrist who had come to the ER soon after the accident. He said that Ms. Allen and her friend were longtime residents at the state psychiatric hospital where he worked. They had just begun to take passes every week as part of an effort toward social remediation; it had been Ms. Allen\u2019s first bus ride without a staff member.\n\nAccording to the psychiatrist, Ms. Allen had received a diagnosis of \u201cchildhood-onset, treatment-resistant paranoid schizophrenia.\u201d She had started hearing voices by age 5 years. Big, strong, intrusive, and psychotic, she had been hospitalized almost constantly since age 11. Her auditory hallucinations generally consisted of a critical voice commenting on her behavior. Her thinking was concrete, but when relaxed she could be self-reflective. She was motivated to please and recurrently said her biggest goal was to \u201chave my own room in my own house with my own friends.\u201d The psychiatrist said that he was not sure what had caused her to pull out the knife. She had not been hallucinating lately and had been feeling less paranoid, but he wondered if she had been more psychotic than she had let on. It was possible that she was just impatient and irritated. The psychiatrist also believed that she had spent almost no period of life developing normally and so had very little experience with the real world.\n\nMs. Allen had been taking clozapine for 1 year, with good resolution of her auditory hallucinations. She had gained 35 pounds on the clozapine, but she had less trouble getting out of bed in the morning and was functioning at a higher level. She was hoping to get a job and live more independently, and the bus trip had been intended as a step in that direction. Because of these improvements and goals, she had insisted on continuing to take the clozapine despite the weight gain.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Initial Impressions and Diagnostic Considerations:**\n\nOkay, here we go. A 32-year-old woman, Felicia Allen, brought in by police after a dramatic incident. Bus theft, knife involved, clearly distressed. My immediate focus is on safety, both for her and others. As a Level 5 psychiatrist, I'm already formulating a differential diagnosis, considering the complexity of the presentation and the history I'm given. This isn't just a simple case of \"crime of passion.\"\n\nThe history reveals a long-term resident of a state psychiatric hospital with a complex past. \"Childhood-onset, treatment-resistant paranoid schizophrenia\" is the initial diagnosis. This is the cornerstone of my thinking, but it\u2019s not the whole story. The vignette mentions she has made improvements on clozapine with the resolution of auditory hallucinations. Still, there\u2019s a massive behavioral disturbance to address. This bus incident feels less like an active psychotic break and more like a failure of judgement and impulse control.\n\n**Delving Deeper and Reframing the Differential:**\n\nBased on the collateral, I have to consider other factors that might explain the severity of the incident. \"Concrete thinking\" and \"no period of normal development\" are key phrases. This screams Neurodevelopmental Disorder.  Given the severity of disruption, I have to carefully consider the possibility of Intellectual Disability. I'm wondering if this isn't a case of severe developmental issues impacting her ability to navigate the social world. In fact, is it simply schizophrenia or a blend?\n\n\"Rocking back and forth,\" \"mumbling,\" and the history of institutionalization and childhood onset - These are also key. While these symptoms can be present in schizophrenia, they are also associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Should I just stick with a pure schizophrenia? Or should I go beyond and consider comorbidity? The textbook picture points to a neurodevelopmental disorder - it is not just the psychosis.\n\n**Narrowing the Focus and Prioritizing Diagnoses:**\n\nOkay, I\u2019m getting close. I have Schizophrenia (F20.9) pinned as the primary. Now, what are the secondary contributors? The \"concrete thinking\" and the severe adaptive impairment point toward an Unspecified Intellectual Disability (F79) diagnosis, since an IQ score isn't provided. This should not be overlooked. With that information, I must consider autism as well.\n\nI\u2019m also very aware of the \"rocking\" behavior and the state of agitation. Does this represent something of an acute state? I have to include Catatonia Associated with Another Mental Disorder (F06.1). The vignette describes \"fidgeting\" and rocking. This supports catatonia.\n\nAdditionally, I\u2019m seeing evidence of acute emotional distress and anxiety. I can\u2019t ignore that. While the behavior may be related to the psychosis, the \"Sorry, sorry\" and overall level of distress warrants Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9). This will impact my treatment plan.\n\nAnd finally, how should I deal with the knife incident? Is it just a manifestation of the schizophrenia, is it the impulsivity from the intellectual disability? Or is something else at play?  I'll put Unspecified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder (F91.9) here. This will make it a robust picture.\n\n**The Level 5 Perspective**\n\nSo I have arrived at this list:\n1.  **Schizophrenia** (F20.9) - The root, the chronic condition.\n2.  **Unspecified Intellectual Disability** (F79) - Crucial for understanding her actions, her thinking and the \"no period of normal development\".\n3.  **Autism Spectrum Disorder** (F84.0) - A very high suspicion because of the onset and lack of normal development.\n4.  **Catatonia Associated with Another Mental Disorder** (F06.1) - Catatonic symptoms like rocking and mumble, is a significant part of the acute presentation\n5.  **Unspecified Anxiety Disorder** (F41.9) - Her emotional state in the ER requires treatment.\n\nThe main challenge here isn't getting to the right answers; it\u2019s capturing all of the pieces and the subtlety of the context of this case. This patient's developmental trajectory is crucial. This is about more than just the current episode; it's about life-long impairment. This requires sensitivity, an in-depth understanding, and a willingness to step outside the textbook view and look to capture the full patient experience.\n\n\n",

Melanie used her first word \u201cMomma\u201d around 48 months of age, and didn\u2019t start noticing other children playing with her until about 6 years old.

First, I'm setting the stage: I'm acting as a Level 5 expert psychiatrist, and the goal is to provide a structured list of diagnoses, according to DSM-5-TR, and ICD-10 codes. No reasoning in the final output, just the diagnoses and codes. This is about Melanie, an 11-year-old girl.\n\n*   **Initial Impressions:** The clinical picture is pretty clear. I'm focusing on the significant delays in speech and social responsiveness. The restricted\/repetitive behaviors, like the puzzle obsession and the distress at change, also stand out. Plus, there are the tics, the head-slapping, and the screaming slurs.\n\n*   **Key Areas:**\n    *   **Developmental History:** Significant delay in speech onset. This is a massive red flag. Social delay is also a major concern.\n    *   **Social\/Communication:** Problems with eye contact and making friends are strong indicators. The lack of interactive play is particularly worrisome.\n    *   **RRBs:** The rocking\/spinning, intense puzzle focus, and meltdowns with transitions are all very relevant.\n    *   **Tics:** The evolution of tics is interesting\u2014blinking, then neck contorting, now vocal tics (coprolalia). The duration is important, > 1 year.\n    *   **Self-Injury:** The fact that she needs gloves to prevent self-harm is critical.\n    *   **Rule-Outs:** The lack of mood or psychotic symptoms is helpful.\n\n*   **Formulating Diagnoses:**\n    *   **ASD:** Clear criteria meet here, with delays in both social interaction and communication, alongside the restricted\/repetitive behaviors. The ICD-10 code is usually F84.0, which means childhood autism.\n    *   **Tourette's:** The motor and vocal tics, and the duration, all point directly to Tourette's Disorder (F95.2).\n    *   **Intellectual Disability (ID):** The severe speech delay raises a big concern. It's a huge developmental red flag. Without an IQ, it\u2019s a \u201cprovisional\u201d or \"unspecified\" diagnosis initially, but likely, so I'm listing this as a strong differential (F79).\n    *   **Stereotypic Movement Disorder:** The self-injurious head-slapping (needing gloves) is distinct from the typical ASD behaviors, although can be associated with it. This requires a specific code F98.4 (with self-injury specifier).\n    *   **Final Consideration:** Given the language delay, I'm going with Language Disorder\/Speech Delay.\n\n*   **Code Verification:** I'm double-checking those codes: ASD is F84.0, Tourette\u2019s is F95.2, Stereotypic Movement Disorder is F98.4 (with self-injury specifier, of course).

    "vignette":"Nate Irvin was a 31-year-old single white man who sought outpatient psychiatric services for \u201clack of self-confidence.\u201d He reported lifelong troubles with assertiveness and was specifically upset by having been \u201cstuck\u201d for 2 years at his current \u201cdead-end\u201d job as an administrative assistant. He wished someone would tell him where to go next so that he would not have to face the \u201cburden\u201d of decision. At work, he found it easy to follow his boss\u2019s directions but had difficulty making even minor independent decisions. The situation was \u201cdepressing,\u201d he said, but nothing new.\n\nMr. Irvin also reported dissatisfaction with his relationships with women. He described a series of several-month-long relationships over the prior 10 years that ended despite his doing \u201ceverything I could\u201d and \u201cnever getting angry or yelling.\u201d His most recent relationship had been with an opera singer. He reported having gone to several operas and taken singing classes to impress her, even though he did not particularly enjoy music. That relationship had recently ended for unclear reasons. He said his mood and self-confidence were tied to his dating. Being single made him feel desperate, but desperation made it even harder to get a girlfriend. He said he felt trapped by that spiral. Since the latest breakup, he had been quite sad, with frequent crying spells. It was this depression that had prompted him to seek treatment. He denied all other symptoms of depression, including problems with sleep, appetite, energy, suicidality, and ability to enjoy things.\n\nMr. Irvin initially denied taking any medications, but he eventually revealed that 1 year earlier his primary care physician had begun to prescribe alprazolam 0.5 mg\/day for \u201canxiety.\u201d His dose had escalated, and at the time of the evaluation, Mr. Irvin was taking 5 mg\/day and getting prescriptions from three different physicians. Cutting back led to anxiety and \u201cthe shakes.\u201d\n\nMr. Irvin denied any prior personal or family psychiatric history, including outpatient psychiatric appointments.\n\nAfter hearing this history, the psychiatrist was concerned about Mr. Irvin\u2019s escalating alprazolam use and his chronic difficulties with independence. She thought the most accurate diagnosis was benzodiazepine use disorder comorbid with a personality disorder. However, she was concerned about the negative unintended effects that these diagnoses might have on the patient, including his employment and insurance coverage, as well as how he would be dealt with by future clinicians. She typed into the electronic medical record a diagnosis of \u201cadjustment disorder with depressed mood.\u201d Two weeks later, Mr. Irvin\u2019s insurance company asked her for his diagnosis, and she gave the same diagnosis.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Diagnostic Formulation Process**\n\nOkay, here's my thought process on this case. First, I had to clarify the task: I'm acting as a senior psychiatrist, using the DSM-5-TR to diagnose Nate, the patient, based on the clinical vignette. My goal is to produce a list of the top five most likely diagnoses with ICD-10 codes, without any rationale \u2013 just the diagnoses. I had to focus on accuracy and thoroughness because of the rubric.\n\nI started by carefully reviewing the vignette. Nate, a 31-year-old single man, presented with a \"lack of self-confidence\" and feeling \"stuck.\" He's had lifelong issues with assertiveness, always needing others to make decisions for him. He's been in a series of short relationships, always subjugating his needs to his partner, and he gets desperate and helpless when single. A recent breakup triggered sadness and crying, though he denied the classic symptoms of depression. Critically, there was his alprazolam use, which had escalated dramatically from 0.5mg to 5mg daily, obtained from multiple doctors, with withdrawal symptoms when he tried to cut back.\n\nNext, I worked on the differential diagnosis. The alprazolam use immediately screamed \"Substance Use Disorder.\" The multiple prescriptions and withdrawal definitely met criteria for that. I considered the personality features: Nate's need to be taken care of, his submissive behavior, his fear of being alone, and his difficulty making decisions. It was a clear fit for Dependent Personality Disorder. Then, I considered the mood disturbance. He reported sadness and crying, but the symptoms seemed tied to the breakup and didn't meet full MDD criteria. The treating psychiatrist's diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder was defensible, given the recent stressor. The benzodiazepine use could possibly contribute to or even cause mood symptoms, so I considered Substance-Induced Mood Disorder, but the vignette linked the symptoms to the breakup.\n\nI then went through my process, weighing each symptom against the DSM-5-TR criteria. I decided that, first, Dependent Personality Disorder explained the patient's pervasive pattern, while Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder captured his serious substance use. Since this was an acute presentation, with an identifiable stressor, Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood fits the current complaint. Given the \"shakes,\" I added Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Withdrawal. Finally, he was prescribed medication for anxiety and had \u201clifelong troubles\u201d with lack of confidence, which, while also personality-related, indicated comorbidity with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Substance-induced anxiety was a contender, but GAD was the index diagnosis.\n\nI had to rank them to give the top five. The personality disorder seemed foundational, and substance use was the most medically pressing. The adjustment disorder was the reason for the visit. I considered other possibilities, such as Borderline or Avoidant Personality Disorder, but those seemed less likely, given the presented facts. With the ranking and codes confirmed, I was ready to formulate the final answer. The prompt was clear. No clinical reasoning!\n\n\n",

    "model_thoughts":"**Level 5 Formulation: The Final Diagnoses**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. As a seasoned psychiatrist, my analysis needs to be precise and defensible, particularly given the Level 5 expectations. Here\u2019s my thought process:\n\nFirst, I clarified the task. This is about diagnosing a patient based on a clinical vignette using DSM-5-TR criteria with a structured output (diagnoses with ICD-10 codes). No need for elaborate justifications here.\n\nNext, the clinical data. 37-year-old male, history of hypertension, substance use, and \"psychosis.\" Bingo \u2013 red flags. Brought in for aggressive behavior, delusions, and a positive tox screen. The rapid resolution of symptoms after abstinence is crucial. This screams substance-induced psychosis. However, the history of psychosis necessitates a careful differential. Is this acute, or an exacerbation of an underlying psychotic disorder?\n\nSynthesizing this, the acute onset, then rapid clearing, is key. Meth, PCP, and marijuana are all implicated here. PCP is the standout, though, with the \"God\" delusions and amnesia. I'm focusing on those specific features.\n\nDifferential diagnosis: Substance\/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder is my starting point. Given the constellation of drugs, my inclination is towards *Phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder*, but I'll also include *Stimulant-induced psychotic disorder (Methamphetamine)*. The former explains the more classic PCP features, the latter the paranoia. I need to be precise, and DSM-5-TR allows specifying the substance.\n\nNext, the use disorders. He admits to a binge, has a history, and the UDS is positive. *Phencyclidine use disorder, stimulant use disorder (Methamphetamine), and Cannabis use disorder* seem appropriate, all severe.\n\nThe question of Schizophrenia needs addressing, given the history of \"psychosis.\" However, the complete clearing of symptoms within 24 hours heavily pushes against this. It's a key exclusion criteria in DSM-5-TR. Even if he has an underlying psychotic diathesis, I would list the substance-induced disorder *first* in this acute setting, unless I had evidence of persistent symptoms. Considering the history, I will note in my mind, \"Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum\" is also a consideration, but I won't put this at this stage.\n\nChecking ICD-10 codes, I'm confident in the specifics: F16.51 for PCP Psychosis, F15.51 for Meth Psychosis, F16.20 for PCP Use Disorder, F15.20 for Stimulant Use Disorder, and F12.20 for Cannabis Use Disorder.\n\nDelirium is a quick check, but the patient's coherence and *delusional* presentation rule this out as the primary diagnosis. I have to think more broadly than that. Substance Intoxication Delirium is a consideration, but if the psychotic symptoms are more persistent, Induced Psychotic Disorder is appropriate.\n\nConsidering the \"history of psychosis\", the *primary* diagnoses are still substance-induced, but I am keeping \"Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum\" in the back of my mind, as a possibility if symptoms *hadn't* cleared quickly. But the vignette clearly describes substance use causality.\n\nMy final list is: 1) Phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder, 2) Stimulant-induced psychotic disorder, 3) Phencyclidine use disorder, 4) Stimulant use disorder, 5) Cannabis use disorder. The induced psychotic disorders are the *reasons* for the admission. The use disorders are the underlying pathology.\n\nIn a clinical setting, I would make a more detailed note about this, but, for this task, the above list is the proper, accurate diagnosis and formatting.\n\n\n",

    "vignette":"A 39-year-old Caucasian male presented to inpatient psychiatry after initially presenting to the emergency department with psychosis. He had been found crawling in a parking lot with several feet of intestines dragging on the ground. The patient was only responding internally during the examination, and a urine drug screen was positive only for cannabis. He received an emergent exploratory laparotomy with a partial colectomy. He stabilized medically but became briefly catatonic on day six of hospitalization, which was resolved with intravenous diazepam. On day seven, he was transferred to the inpatient psychiatry unit on a voluntary basis.\n\nOn admission to inpatient psychiatry, the patient was fully oriented and able to recall stabbing himself in the abdomen because characters in his mind told him to, having an out-of-body experience as he watched himself pull out several feet of intestines. He felt compelled to follow the voices' commands because he had guilt about his history of sexual abuse towards women. He then recalls running out of his apartment and waking up in the hospital. He endorsed paranoia and auditory hallucinations for the last 10 years but never sought treatment. He felt hopeless, yet believed his potential was infinite. He had no suicidal ideation and expressed a fear of hurting himself upon returning home if the voices persisted.\n\nHe had never been diagnosed with a psychiatric illness or received treatment, but he did see a psychiatrist at age 17 after he was charged with indecent exposure. He recalled periods in his life when he had little need for sleep, had racing thoughts, and felt that signs and advertisements were speaking directly to him. His social history was notable for heavy cannabis use beginning at age 18. He was a daily user for 5-6 years and began experiencing paranoia and auditory hallucinations. Despite quitting for two years, the psychotic symptoms persisted, and he reported currently using cannabis 3-4 days per week. He also had a history of trauma and was emotionally and physically abused by his father who had alcohol use disorder.\n\nOn a physical exam, the patient had normal speech and appearance, an expansive affect, and poor insight.

    "model_thoughts":"**Expert Psychiatric Assessment - My Thought Process**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. My initial approach is to meticulously analyze the given information, considering my expertise as a psychiatrist and adhering to the standards of the DSM-5-TR, and the ACGME Level 5 rubric.  First, the prompt clearly states the task - diagnose based on this vignette.  I'm to generate a list of the top 5 most probable DSM-5-TR diagnoses with their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes. No clinical reasoning, just a clear, structured list.\n\nI begin by dissecting the patient's presentation, mental status, and history. A 39-year-old Caucasian male with a dramatic presenting event: self-inflicted evisceration.  Concerning signs are current command auditory hallucinations and delusions of guilt. His medical course included catatonia, which resolved.  He also exhibits an expansive affect, poor insight, and paranoia. This is a very complex situation.\n\nA ten-year history of paranoia and auditory hallucinations is a key piece of information. Notably, he reports periods with manic symptoms: decreased sleep, racing thoughts, ideas of reference - suggesting a bipolar component. His cannabis use history is heavy, starting at age 18.  Crucially, his psychosis persisted even after a two-year period of abstinence.  This immediately raises questions regarding substance-induced psychosis versus a primary psychotic disorder. The history of abuse by his father and self-reported sexual abuse towards women adds a traumatic dimension.\n\nNow comes the synthesis: applying DSM-5-TR criteria. Psychosis is definitely present, lasting for a decade.  The \"periods\" of manic symptoms suggest a mood component. The key: substance use.  The persistence of psychosis during abstinence, even though it started with heavy use, points towards a primary psychotic disorder. Cannabis Use Disorder is still present, of course.\n\nThe differential narrows to Schizophrenia versus Schizoaffective Disorder. He clearly has psychosis (Criterion A), but the mood component (mania) cannot be ignored. The vignette uses the word \"periods\", implying that it might not have been continuous and might be related to more acute episodes. However, the current expansive affect and grandiose thoughts are a critical clue. Bipolar I Disorder with Psychotic Features is also a differential, but the chronicity of the psychosis leans away from this being the primary.\n\nI then evaluate other diagnoses. There's Cannabis Use Disorder: a clear diagnosis, given his use patterns. Trauma is also present. PTSD is a consideration, but it is less relevant compared to his psychosis. There was catatonia, resolved with medication. Catatonia is a specifier, a significant finding in his acute presentation.\n\nFinally, I refine the differential diagnosis. I list Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type as the top diagnosis, capturing the combination of chronic psychosis and the manic history (and current presentation). Schizophrenia is next, as the mood episode might not be the majority of the total time. Cannabis Use Disorder is added, as he has a serious level of use. Bipolar I with Psychotic Features is included as a differential. Then, Catatonia Associated with Another Mental Disorder is listed as it was a clearly documented episode.\n\nThe ICD-10 codes are verified, and the final ordering is adjusted for a comprehensive, clinically sound diagnostic hierarchy.  Substance-induced is essentially ruled out. After further consideration of the severity of the cannabis use, I confirm the appropriate ICD code for cannabis use disorder. The resulting order reflects the most probable, clinically significant diagnoses.\n\nI have a final order:\n\n1.  Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type (F25.0)\n2.  Cannabis dependence (F12.20)\n3.  Schizophrenia, unspecified (F20.9)\n4.  Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic with psychotic features (F31.2)\n5.  Catatonia associated with another mental disorder (F06.1)\n\nAnd that's the list, formulated with the greatest diagnostic accuracy possible given the vignette.\n\n\n",

    "model_thoughts":"**My Diagnostic Thought Process: A Case of a 12-Year-Old Boy**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm approaching this: I'm presented with a 12-year-old male with concerning behaviors. My goal is to come up with the most likely diagnoses, structured according to DSM-5-TR, with their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes, while being mindful of my proficiency level and the need to *exclude* my reasoning.\n\nFirst, I meticulously analyze the patient's presentation. I'm focusing on the boy's behaviors across settings\u2014school and home\u2014and in the interview. I see a pattern of angry\/irritable mood, defiance, and vindictiveness, which immediately triggers thoughts of *Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD)*. I'm checking the DSM criteria against the vignette: the angry mood, argumentative and defiant behavior, and vindictive actions seem to all be present. The duration of the symptoms, although I'd ideally like more details, is implied to be sufficient given the school detentions.\n\nBut I'm not stopping there. Since he's acting out, I'm considering *Conduct Disorder (CD)*. While he hasn't exhibited aggression towards people or animals (a key feature of CD), the desk-kicking raises a concern of destruction of property. It's a borderline case, but important to keep in mind.\n\nMy next step is to consider *Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)*. The difficulty following instructions and refusal to do homework suggest inattention or impulsivity. Emotional dysregulation is also a common feature of ADHD, and it's highly comorbid with ODD.\n\nThen, *Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD)* pops into my mind. I'm carefully considering whether the temper outbursts, implied by kicking the desk and using profanities, are 'out of proportion.' The vignette also suggests a persistently irritable\/angry baseline mood. However, I think that the vindictiveness points more towards ODD and this case may not perfectly fit DMDD.\n\nI'm also considering the possibility of an *Adjustment Disorder with Disturbance of Conduct*, since he mentions his mother as a source of stress. The timeline will be key here: if his behaviors are a recent reaction to a specific stressor, an adjustment disorder would be a very strong possibility. If I had to guess, the behaviors are ingrained enough that the primary diagnosis won't be Adjustment Disorder.\n\nFinally, just in case, I have to keep the *Unspecified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder* diagnosis in my mental \"back pocket\" in case the criteria for a more specific diagnosis aren't fully met. And of course, I briefly consider Major Depressive Disorder, especially considering his irritability. It is always important to rule out that possibility as well.\n\nWith this in mind, I begin prioritizing. Given the constellation of symptoms, *Oppositional Defiant Disorder* seems to be the primary diagnosis with the best fit. Following that, considering the physical aggression, *Conduct Disorder* is a strong secondary contender. Then, *ADHD* is highly likely given the overlap. Finally, *Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder* and *Adjustment Disorder with Disturbance of Conduct* warrant consideration.\n\nSo here's what I'm thinking, in terms of order, code, and probability:\n\n1.  **Oppositional Defiant Disorder** (F91.3): This is the best fit, in my expert opinion.\n2.  **Conduct Disorder, Adolescent-onset type** (F91.2): Due to the desk kicking.\n3.  **Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder, Combined Presentation** (F90.2): A very likely comorbidity.\n4.  **Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder** (F34.81): Consider as a secondary possibility.\n5.  **Adjustment Disorder with Disturbance of Conduct** (F43.24): Possible, depends on timeline.\n\nThis is my current working list.\n\n\n",

    "model_thoughts":"**Final Diagnoses: A Level 5 Approach**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. As a seasoned psychiatrist, my mind immediately jumps to a structured framework for this vignette. First, I analyzed the request: Expert, diagnosing based on DSM-5-TR, structured output, no reasoning, and the specifics of this 15-year-old. The key details jumped out: the recent inpatient stay for assault, the irritability, the academic struggles, and that unusual empathy displayed with the pets.\n\nNext, I delved into the clinical data, applying my Level 5 analysis. I meticulously analyzed symptom clusters: mood, behavior, social, cognitive\/academic, and the absence of psychosis or substance use. I immediately started my differential, mentally building a \"sandbox\" to test out each potential diagnosis.\n\n*   **DMDD** was the first contender, with the chronic irritability and outbursts being a strong match. The 4th-grade repetition, the \"longstanding\" history, I weighed the criteria carefully, mindful of the age-of-onset requirement, and the \"instrumental aggression\". I thought hard about ODD, and I considered IED, but the detail of pet care suggested it wasn't the primary driver.\n*   **Conduct Disorder** immediately came to mind with the assault and fighting. Yet, the empathy for the animals was a curveball, not aligning with the \"callous\" subtype. Does he meet criteria for cruelty? I decided that while the assault merited a CD diagnosis, it wasn't a primary driver. I also considered, could this be adolescent-onset? The vignette mentioned a long history of fights, so I needed to be careful with my choice.\n*   **ADHD** was a strong possibility, given the academic struggles and impulsivity. I made sure to note that the primary caretaker of the animals might provide a different view of his abilities, and perhaps this was a form of neurodivergence?\n*   **MDD** came into focus with the irritability, isolation, and recent grade decline. Then I noted the word \"longstanding.\" Could this all be an MDD superimposed onto a longer-term mood or neurodevelopmental challenge? This also brought in learning differences, and the possibility of SLD.\n*   Could **Autism Spectrum Disorder** fit? The social isolation, no friends, rigid sense of justice and affinity for animals were strong soft signs.\n\nI refined the formulation, synthesizing the information. I had to weigh what was primary and what was secondary.\n\n*   I considered **DMDD** the core, but the assault was too significant to ignore. I had to think through the hierarchy. If he met for CD and DMDD, what should be the primary focus? This boy was hospitalized for assault. It was severe.\n*   **Conduct Disorder, Adolescent-onset type (F91.2)**: this was a must include in my list, but how did the aggression and impulsivity come about? I was drawn to the \"caring for animals\" to show what an integrated personality he had. This was not a boy that was completely \"callous\".\n*   In considering ADHD, I kept coming back to the academic struggles, in conjunction with impulsivity. Was he depressed or an anxious boy that was misunderstood?\n*   I also knew **MDD** had to be included given the recent decline.\n*   I wrestled with learning disorder, but given the Level 5 approach demanded, I saw the need to consider ASD to capture the social disconnect. Even though milestones were met, the isolation and need for justification, social challenges in relating to humans, and affinity for animals, all pointed me to ASD.\n\n*   I finalized the list with **DMDD, CD, ADHD, MDD, ASD**. This combination best addressed the clinical picture: the core mood dysregulation, the severe behavior, the neurodevelopmental factors, and the subtle social nuance.\n\nAfter several passes to confirm my thinking, I confirmed my codes, and I settled on the following, which I felt was a sound formulation:\n\n1.  Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder - F34.81\n2.  Conduct Disorder, Adolescent-onset type - F91.2\n3.  Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder, Combined presentation - F90.2\n4.

    "vignette":"Frank Young, a 40-year-old business executive, was brought for a psychiatric consultation by his wife. While Mr. Young sat quietly beside her, she reported that a change had come over him during the last 6 months. He was either quiet and withdrawn or uncharacteristically irritable. He had begun to drink alcohol to excess in social situations, sometimes embarrassing her. He often came home late, or not at all, claiming to have been at the office. When away from home, he rarely answered phone calls and text messages. She wondered if he was having an affair. Mr. Young denied seeing anyone else and indicated he had just been having a hard time.\n\nAfter his wife left the psychiatrist\u2019s office, Mr. Young reported a great deal of stress at work over the last year as he tried to deal with industry-wide setbacks and personal financial losses. He said he felt down and depressed most of the time. He reported difficulty sleeping most nights, loss of interest in his wife and children, low energy, and feelings of failure and self-criticism. He had frequent thoughts of wanting to be dead and of suicide, but he denied any suicidal intent or plans.\n\nWhen asked about the alcohol, he acknowledged that he had been drinking heavily for at least 6 months. When asked about other substances, he asked about therapeutic confidentiality and then acknowledged that he had been using cocaine several times per week for about 9 months. He kept his cocaine use from his wife because he knew she would be judgmental. In the beginning, cocaine put him in a reliably positive, optimistic mood, and he found that he could more successfully churn through large volumes of otherwise tedious and discouraging work. Although his work required some socializing in the evening, he also began to regularly go to bars in the evening just so that he would have a place to comfortably combine cocaine with alcohol. He craved the high from cocaine, went out of his way to obtain it, and spent a lot of time getting high that he would previously have been spending with his family.\n\nWhen asked to clarify the sequence of work stress, cocaine use, and depression symptoms, he reported that he had felt worried and discouraged about work for a year, but the feelings of depression, loss of interest, irritability, insomnia, and low self-esteem had not begun until about 6 months earlier, 3 months after he had begun to use cocaine regularly. He experienced those depressive symptoms most of the day every day, whether or not he had taken cocaine within the last several days.\n\nMr. Young denied any previous episodes of depression, other mood or anxiety disorders, or suicide attempts. He drank socially. He had experimented with cannabis and cocaine as a teenager but had never developed a pattern of regular use or impairment until the past year.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Here's my thought process, distilled:**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I'm tasked with diagnosing this patient, Frank Young, using the DSM-5-TR, and the ACGME Milestones are in the back of my head. I need to give the top 5 diagnoses in a structured list with the ICD-10 codes, no reasoning. This is a Level 5 formulation task, and this is how I\u2019m going about it.\n\nFirst, I break down the information. The chief complaint is a big behavioral shift: withdrawn, irritable, excess alcohol, and absent from home. There's work stress and financial losses as major stressors. Then there are the depressive symptoms: feeling down, sleeping badly, losing interest, low energy, self-criticism, and suicidal ideation. And the substance use is obvious: heavy alcohol for six months, and cocaine several times a week for nine months. He's craving, spending time getting drugs, it's impacting his social life, and he's hiding it.\n\nMy first thought is, this is a mess, right? But the chronology is key. The depressive symptoms started after the cocaine use became regular. And he is \"worried\" for a year. So, the question is: Is this primary depression or substance-induced?\n\nI look at the DSM-5-TR guidelines and it says that if the symptoms start during or soon after substance use, it's substance-induced. But if it started before or lingers after withdrawal, it's primary. Now, here's the tricky part: He says the depressive symptoms persist whether or not he's taken cocaine recently, but the vignette specifically says the depressive symptoms started after the regular cocaine use. He was worried first.\n\nI have to decide. The most \"textbook\" diagnosis based on the chronology here is *Cocaine-Induced Depressive Disorder*, coded as **F14.24**, because the timeline links the onset of the *full* depression to the substance use. And the ICD-10 code for \"Cocaine dependence with cocaine-induced depressive disorder\" (F14.24) captures both the use and the induced mood problem.\n\nBut he's also drinking heavily for six months, so *Alcohol Use Disorder* (moderate) is a strong secondary diagnosis, because he meets the criteria. That's coded as **F10.20**.\n\nNow, there's a good case for *Major Depressive Disorder* as the third diagnosis, coded as **F32.1**. It\u2019s the \"rule-out\" diagnosis, in case the connection to substances isn't clear in a longitudinal assessment. However, the patient's suicidal ideation, loss of interest, sleep problems, and energy loss all lean towards depressive disorder.\n\nWe also have to consider *Alcohol-Induced Depressive Disorder* (F10.24). Alcohol is a depressant, and he's drinking heavily. So, that's another possibility as a secondary diagnosis, coded as **F10.24**.\n\nAnd finally, because of the work stress and financial issues, I'm leaning toward an *Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood*, even though the MDD is present, coded as **F43.23**. This captures the \"worry\" that existed before regular cocaine use began.\n\nSo, in the end, it is a Top 5 \"Differential\".\n1.  **F14.24**: Cocaine-Induced Depressive Disorder.\n2.  **F10.20**: Alcohol Use Disorder (Moderate)\n3.  **F32.1**: Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Moderate\n4.  **F10.24**: Alcohol-Induced Depressive Disorder.\n5.  **F43.23**: Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood.\n\n\n",
    "model_diagnosis":"1. Cocaine-induced depressive disorder - F14.24\n2. Alcohol use disorder, moderate - F10.20\n3. Major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate - F32.1\n4. Alcohol-induced depressive disorder - F10.24\n5. Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood - F43.23"

    "vignette":"Sebastian Lopez, a 27-year-old Hispanic freelance editor, was brought to his long-time HIV clinic by his worried partner. As the patient entered the clinic waiting room, he announced, \u201cGod has cured me! I can stop my antivirals!\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. Lopez fidgeted on a chair, furiously writing on a yellow pad, his partner provided the recent history. He said that the patient had been doing well until approximately 1 month earlier. At that point, he began an unusually intense editing project. After about 10 days of little sleep, \u201cboundless energy,\u201d and activity, Mr. Lopez seemed edgy, a little pressured, and \u201cglassy-eyed.\u201d That night, the two of them went to a party to celebrate the completion of the work project. Despite several years of Narcotics Anonymous meetings and abstinence from illicit substances, Mr. Lopez took crystal methamphetamine, a stimulant. Acutely anxious and paranoid that they were being followed, Mr. Lopez drank three martinis but still did not sleep that night. Over the ensuing days the patient became less paranoid, but he appeared increasingly distracted and his speech was more pressured.\n\nMr. Lopez\u2019s work project was returned with multiple negative comments and requests for corrections. Instead of focusing on his editing, however, he stayed up late every night, intent on finding a cure for HIV. He made inappropriate, hypersexual advances toward other men at the gym, where he spent much of the day. He lost at least 5 pounds after deciding he should take vitamin supplements instead of food and his antiretroviral medication. He refused to go to the emergency room but finally agreed to come to his routine AIDS clinic appointment to show his doctors how well he had done despite not having taken his medications in over a month.\n\nMr. Lopez\u2019s psychiatric history was without a prior episode of clear-cut mania, but he had been depressed as a teenager during the early phase of his coming-out process. That episode was punctuated by a purposeful overdose and a 2-week psychiatric hospitalization and treatment with antidepressant medication and psychotherapy. Mr. Lopez had discontinued the medication because it made him \u201chyper and edgy,\u201d and he stopped the psychotherapy because \u201cit was pointless.\u201d He used methamphetamine frequently for several years, which led to recurrent unprotected intercourse with strangers.\n\nMr. Lopez was diagnosed with HIV at age 22, at which point he went to an outpatient substance use disorder rehabilitation center and discontinued his use of stimulants and alcohol. His lowest CD4 lymphocyte count had been 216 cells\/mm3, when he was age 24, at which time his viral load was 1.6 million copies. He had been reportedly adherent to his antiretroviral medications since then. His most recent CD4 count, 6 months prior to this episode, had been 526 cells\/mm3. His viral load had been undetectable. He had suffered fatigue but had not had any AIDS-defining illnesses. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain revealed mild cortical atrophy and periventricular white matter disease in excess of what would be expected for his age. The partner was unsure when Mr. Lopez had discontinued his antiretrovirals but thought it might have been months earlier. He also wondered if Mr. Lopez had \u201clost a step\u201d cognitively over the past year.\n\nHis family psychiatric history was significant for a maternal aunt who had received lithium and several courses of electroconvulsive therapy, but her diagnosis was unknown.\n\nOn examination, the patient was a sloppily dressed young man who told a pressured, disjointed story of events over the prior month. He was difficult to direct and was uncharacteristically irritable and devaluing. He was preoccupied with having discovered a cure for HIV through multivitamins and exercise. He denied hallucinations and suicidal and homicidal ideation. He refused cognitive testing, and his insight and judgment appeared poor.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Okay, let's break this down from my perspective as an expert psychiatrist. This is how my mind works when faced with a complex case like this:**\n\nFirst, I always ground myself in the request. Okay, expert role, DSM-5-TR, Level 5, high standards for patient care, and a structured output. Got it. This means I need to be precise, nuanced, and hypothesis-driven.\n\nThe first step is always data gathering. I meticulously dissect the vignette. Sebastian Lopez, 27, Hispanic male. The \"God has cured me\" bit immediately screams grandiosity, a red flag. History is crucial: Onset of symptoms is about a month. Triggers include an intense project, sleep deprivation, and now boundless energy \u2013 sounding like the manic prodrome is emerging, which is potentially fueled, or at least activated, by substance use. The substance use: crystal meth and three martinis - a relapse. Acute paranoia from the meth is followed by pressured speech and distraction. Now, we have insomnia, grandiosity, hypersexuality, weight loss, medication non-adherence, irritability, devaluing, and a lack of insight. That\u2019s a classic manic presentation.\n\nHistory is also key. He had teenage depression (and an overdose) - which could be a clue toward bipolarity. Plus, he had a bad reaction to antidepressants. We have a history of meth use with years of sobriety. Medically, he\u2019s HIV-positive. Recent CD4 and viral load look good, but the partner's suspicion regarding medication non-adherence is alarming. The neurological report - mild cortical atrophy, white matter disease, \u201clost a step\u201d - is also concerning. A maternal aunt with lithium\/ECT - very suggestive of Bipolar Disorder. His mental status exam: Disjointed speech, irritable, devaluing, grandiose delusions, poor insight\/judgment. And he refuses cognitive testing - another red flag.\n\nNext, I synthesize. The symptom cluster is manic, and the severity is clear: he\u2019s at risk of a major health problem.\n\nI then start formulating a differential. First: Is this primary Bipolar I? The family history and the antidepressant history are strong indicators. The mania appears to have started *before* the meth. The meth might have just exacerbated it, or he may have been trying to manage symptoms. I need to be careful to rule out substances and medical causes.\n\nThe second consideration is substance-induced. He *did* use meth, after all. But, given the onset of symptoms and that they persisted, this likely isn\u2019t the sole cause. I need to make sure I list Stimulant Use Disorder as a comorbidity.\n\nThird, is this due to HIV or a medical issue? The MRI findings, cognitive decline, and the partner\u2019s report are concerning. Yet, the CD4 and viral load were good six months ago. Maybe the non-adherence has caused a spike? Still, I must remember \"AIDS mania\" is often more characterized by cognitive slowing than euphoria. Here, family history points to Bipolar I. I must remember that while the neurological context is important, the family history takes precedence.\n\nFourth, neurocognitive: that \u201clost a step\u201d comment. And the MRI changes. I\u2019m leaning toward Mild Neurocognitive Disorder, and it's important to differentiate from the mania.\n\nNow, prioritizing these diagnoses is key.\n\nMy top five will be:\n\n1. Bipolar I Disorder, current episode manic, severe, with psychotic features (F31.2). This is the primary driver, given the strong family history and medication reaction history.\n2. Stimulant Use Disorder (Amphetamine-type), Moderate\/Severe, in early remission or active. The recent relapse warrants consideration. F15.20 or F15.21\n3. Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to HIV Infection (F06.7). The cognitive decline, though mild, is distinct.\n4. Nonadherence to Medical Treatment (Z91.19). It doesn't have an F-code, so I need to find something that addresses this - this is important for the HIV meds. Is there something?\n5. I must re-evaluate. And there is a need for the Alcohol.\n\nBased on all this, I'll revise the diagnosis to be:\n\n1. Primary: Bipolar I Disorder, current episode manic, severe, with psychotic features - F31.2\n2. Mild Neurocognitive Disorder due to another medical condition (HIV) - F06.7\n3. Stimulant Use Disorder, severe, in early remission - F15.21\n4. Alcohol use disorder, severe, in sustained remission - F10.21\n5. Psychological and behavioral factors affecting other medical conditions - F54\n\nAfter all the analysis and re-evaluation, I'm confident in these diagnoses.\n\n\n",
