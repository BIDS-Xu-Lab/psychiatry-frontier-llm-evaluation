    "vignette":"Terry Najarian, a 65-year-old salesman for a large corporation, presented for a psychiatric evaluation after his wife threatened to leave him. Although he said he was embarrassed to discuss his issues with a stranger, he described his sexual interest in women\u2019s undergarments in a quite matter-of-fact manner. This interest had surfaced several years earlier and had not been a problem until he was caught masturbating by his wife 6 weeks prior to the evaluation. Upon seeing him dressed in panties and a bra, she initially \u201cwent nuts,\u201d thinking he was having an affair. After he clarified that he was not seeing anyone else, she \u201cshut him out\u201d and hardly spoke to him. When they argued, she called him a \u201cpervert\u201d and made it clear that she was considering divorce unless he \u201cgot help.\u201d\n\nMr. Najarian\u2019s habit began in the setting of his wife\u2019s severe arthritis and likely depression, both of which significantly reduced her overall activity level and specifically her interest in sex. His \u201cfetish\u201d was the bright spot during his frequent and otherwise dreary business trips. He also masturbated at home but generally waited until his wife was out of the house. His specific pattern was to masturbate about twice weekly, using bras and panties that he had collected over several years. He said that intercourse with his wife had faded to \u201cevery month or two\u201d but was mutually satisfying.\n\nThe patient had been married for over 30 years, and the couple had two grown children. Mr. Najarian had planned to retire comfortably later that year, but not if the two choices were either \u201cto be poor after we split the assets or to sit around the house all day and be called a pervert.\u201d\n\nHe became visibly anxious when discussing his marital difficulties. He described some recent difficulty falling asleep and \u201cworried constantly\u201d about his marriage but denied other psychiatric problems. He had made a show of throwing away a half dozen pieces of underwear, which had seemed to reassure his wife, but he had saved his \u201cfavorites\u201d and \u201ccould always buy more.\u201d He said he was of mixed mind. He did not want to end his marriage, but he saw nothing harmful in his new mode of masturbating. \u201cI\u2019m not unfaithful or doing anything bad,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just excites me, and my wife certainly doesn\u2019t want to be having sex a few times a week.\u201d\n\nMr. Najarian denied any difficulties related to sexual functioning, adding that he could maintain erections and achieve orgasm without women\u2019s undergarments. He recalled being aroused when he touched women\u2019s underwear as a teenager and had masturbated repeatedly to that experience. That fantasy had disappeared when he became sexually active with his wife. He denied any personal or family history of mental illness.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Initial Assessment & Diagnostic Formulation**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. The core of this case involves a paraphilic behavior, specifically the sexual interest and arousal related to women's undergarments.  My first instinct is to zero in on *Transvestic Disorder* (F65.1) given the patient's reported behavior of being \"dressed in panties and a bra\" while masturbating. The DSM-5-TR clearly differentiates this from pure fetishism, where the focus is more on the object itself. However, the mention of \"using bras and panties\" and a history of arousal from \"touching women's underwear\" suggests a possible component of *Fetishistic Disorder* (F65.0) as well.\n\nThe patient's current distress and impairment, namely the threat of divorce, are crucial. I'm noting the anxiety and insomnia he's experiencing in relation to this crisis.  This suggests an *Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety* (F43.22) is very likely, given the clear precipitating stressor. While I considered Generalized Anxiety Disorder, the recent onset and clear link to the marital conflict point more strongly to an adjustment disorder.\n\nSince the prompt asks for five diagnoses, I'll include the catch-all categories as differentials.  *Other Specified Paraphilic Disorder* (F65.89) is a good choice if the patient's presentation doesn't perfectly fit Transvestic or Fetishistic disorders.  And to cover any residual anxiety symptoms,  *Unspecified Anxiety Disorder* (F41.9) is a solid backup.\n\nLet me clarify my thinking on the primary diagnosis: While the fetishistic element is present (and perhaps underlying), the *wearing* of the undergarments appears to be the most clinically significant and troubling aspect, based on the crisis it created. Therefore, Transvestic Disorder will be prioritized.\n\nI did briefly consider other possibilities. There's no evidence to suggest another paraphilic disorder, a personality disorder, or a substance use disorder.\n\n\n",

    "vignette":"A 27-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of convulsions.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 2 years before this admission, when shaking of the trunk, arms, and legs occurred. The episode lasted approximately 4 to 5 minutes and had been preceded by a sharp pain in the back of the head that radiated to the neck, blurred vision, palpitations, nausea, and difficulty concentrating. The patient did not seek evaluation, and no additional convulsive episodes occurred during the subsequent 20 months.\nFour months before this admission, while the patient was drinking alcohol at a party, his body suddenly became stiff, and he fell backward onto a table. Shaking of the trunk, arms, and legs occurred for approximately 5 to 8 minutes. He had urinary incontinence but did not bite his tongue. Five minutes later, similar convulsions occurred. The patient was taken to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. The results of computed tomography of the head were normal, as was an electroencephalogram (EEG) that was obtained over a period of 40 minutes. Treatment with levetiracetam was started. The patient was discharged home with a recommendation for follow-up evaluation at the neurology clinic of the other hospital.\nThree months before this admission, the patient was evaluated at the neurology clinic of the other hospital. He reported that despite the use of levetiracetam, convulsions occurred approximately once per week. The results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, were reportedly normal. Treatment with lamotrigine was started. There was no change in the quality or frequency of the convulsive episodes.\nOne month before this admission, while the patient was at work, his colleagues found him on the floor, and they witnessed \u201cshaking and clenching\u201d movements of the trunk, arms, and legs that lasted approximately 2 minutes. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was taken to the emergency department of a second hospital for evaluation.\nAt least two additional convulsive episodes occurred at the second hospital. During one episode, the shaking movements became less intense when the physician\u2019s hand was placed on the patient\u2019s shoulder; the movements resumed at the previous intensity when the hand was removed. In addition, the patient\u2019s eyes were closed. When the eyelids were opened manually, no nystagmus or gaze deviation was present. When the eyelids were released, the eyes shut forcefully and Bell\u2019s phenomenon (upward deviation of the eyes when closing) occurred. The patient did not speak but was able to follow simple verbal commands, such as an instruction to squeeze the physician\u2019s hands. In between the convulsive episodes, there were intermittent rocking movements of the upper body and nonrhythmic tremulous movements of the hands, and the patient did not speak or follow commands. After several hours, the episodes stopped, and the patient was able to speak. Admission to the hospital was recommended; however, the patient declined because of work obligations and anxiety about being in the hospital. He was discharged home.\nDuring the subsequent month, the patient continued to take levetiracetam and lamotrigine. However, the convulsions increased in frequency to one to three times per week.\nOn the morning before the current admission, while the patient was at work, his colleagues noticed that he abruptly stopped speaking and began to have shaking movements of the arms and legs. Emergency medical services were called. On their arrival, the patient\u2019s body was stiff, and there was twitching of the trunk, arms, and legs. No urinary or fecal incontinence or biting of the tongue had occurred. The patient was able to stand up from a chair and walk to the ambulance. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 111\/56 mm Hg, the pulse 83 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was awake and alert but did not speak. His eyes were open, with a primary midline gaze and blinking in response to visual threat. His body appeared stiff, with the arms and legs straightened. There were intermittent nonrhythmic tremulous movements of the trunk, arms, and legs. The patient was able to follow complex commands and to move the arms and legs symmetrically and against gravity, but there was a delay in motor activation. The deep-tendon reflexes were normal. Extensive scarring from burns was present on the face, trunk, back, arms, and legs.\nApproximately 45 minutes after the tremulous movements had stopped, the patient was able to speak but with limited fluency. Additional history was obtained. He had been taking levetiracetam and lamotrigine as directed; however, 3 days before this evaluation, he had stopped taking these medications because he was unsure whether they were effective. That morning, he had felt well until he noticed a sharp pain in the back of his head that radiated to his neck, along with sudden blurred vision, full-body numbness, and difficulty concentrating. A convulsive episode then occurred that lasted up to 20 minutes; during the episode, the patient was aware of events but sometimes had difficulty hearing. He described his overall mood as \u201cpretty good\u201d and did not report decreased energy or chronic fatigue. There was no history of psychotic or manic symptoms, suicidal ideation, or obsessive or compulsive behaviors.\nThe patient had a history of a febrile seizure in childhood, as well as several concussions that had occurred while he was playing sports in childhood. He reported that during the first 6 years of life, his social supports were limited, and he had experienced maltreatment by a family member; he did not elaborate on the nature of the maltreatment. In late childhood, he was involved in a house fire and hospitalized for a prolonged period because of severe burns on the face, body, arms, and legs. He had asthma, major depressive disorder, chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and panic disorder with agoraphobia. He took escitalopram daily and lorazepam as needed for panic attacks. He was in a long-term romantic relationship. He did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs; he smoked marijuana approximately once per year and drank one alcoholic beverage per week. His father had died of heart disease when the patient was a teenager; his mother had schizoaffective disorder and post-traumatic epilepsy.\nBlood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The blood lactate level was 2.4 mmol per liter (22 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.2 mmol per liter [5 to 20 mg per deciliter]) and the blood creatine kinase level 489 U per liter (reference range, 60 to 400). Serum and urine toxicologic panels were negative. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was admitted to this hospital.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Alright, here's what I'm thinking:** This case is a classic \u2013 a 27-year-old male with \"convulsions.\" My role is clear: expert psychiatrist. The task? Diagnose, using DSM-5-TR\/ICD-10, with a top 5 list and no fluff. Data extraction and diagnostic reasoning are key.\n\nFirst, I dissect the data: convulsions, recurrent over two years, recently worse. Gotta figure: epilepsy or something else? But the data screams \"something else\": normal EEG and MRI, no response to antiepileptics despite reported adherence. Then, the semiology! The distractibility (\"physician's hand\"), eye closure, resisted eye opening, non-rhythmic movements, ability to follow commands, and walk *immediately* after the \"event\" - that\u2019s all *textbook* for something other than epilepsy. Panic-like aura? Maybe, but the semiology slams the door on epilepsy. The only thing leaning towards epilepsy is urinary incontinence and mother with post-traumatic epilepsy. However the semiology overrides the risk factors. The stiffening and shaking are atypical.\n\n**My diagnosis:** Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder (Conversion Disorder) with attacks or seizures. It fits: altered voluntary motor function, evidence of incompatibility with neurological conditions (normal EEG, etc.), and significant distress. The \"attacks or seizures\" specifier nails it.\n\nNext, the psychiatric history: PTSD, MDD, Panic Disorder, Agoraphobia. Boom! Explicitly stated in the vignette. The PTSD is obvious, a history of burns and abuse. MDD is present, though he\u2019s \"pretty good\" on meds. Panic Disorder seems spot-on too, especially given the \"aura\" descriptions.\n\n**Now, prioritization:** Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder (Conversion Disorder) is *it*, the main diagnosis. PTSD comes next, a likely driver, and the panic and MDD as related comorbid conditions. I even considered Factitious or Malingering, but ruled them out.\n\n**So the Top 5 list is this:**\n\n1.  Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder (Conversion Disorder) with attacks or seizures - F44.5. This is the current presentation.\n2.  Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder - F43.10. Clearly linked to severe trauma.\n3.  Panic Disorder - F41.0. The symptoms fit.\n4.  Agoraphobia - F40.00. Also in the history.\n5.  Major Depressive Disorder, Unspecified - F32.9. Standard for past MDD if the episode count isn't in the vignette, and mood is \"pretty good\". Clinically F33 is implied. I went with F32.9, but maybe F33.9 should be used, but since it is not specified and mood is good, I will stick with F32.9\n\nNo alcohol, no drugs, no other factors to consider.\n\n**Final checks:**\n\n*   **F-codes are correct.**\n*   **The evidence *overwhelmingly* rules out epilepsy.** This is pure PNES.\n*   **I've nailed the data extraction, especially the subtle cues.** The eye closure, distractibility, etc.\n*   **My diagnostic reasoning is sound.** FNSD is the correct diagnosis.\n*   **Ready to go!**\n\n\n",

    "vignette":"Only upon the repeated and fervent insistence of her parents did 19-year-old Emily reluctantly agree to see a psychiatrist. \u201cIt\u2019s not me you want to see,\u201d Emily proclaimed emphatically. \u201cIt\u2019s my insane parents who need your help.\u201d Emily did not offer a chief complaint, aside from the concern that her parents were driving her \u201ccrazy.\u201d She added, \u201cEverything is going great in my life. I have plenty of friends, go out almost every night, and always have lots of fun.\u201d\n\nWhile Emily was taking some time away from \u201cthe so-called real world,\u201d her sister was attending Duke University, her younger brother was excelling at a competitive private high school, and both her parents seemed to enjoy their careers as radiologists. She asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s enough strivers for one family?\u201d\n\nEmily agreed to have her parents join the session, and they told a different story. They tearfully disclosed that their daughter had become irritable, unproductive, and oppositional. She drank to intoxication almost every night, often not returning home for an entire weekend. In searching her room, they had found small amounts of marijuana, alprazolam (Xanax), cocaine, and prescription stimulants. The parents described the changes in Emily\u2019s personality as \u201can adolescent nightmare\u201d and described her friends as \u201closers who do nothing but dye their hair, get tattoos, and hate everything.\u201d Emily\u2019s attitudes and behavior contrasted markedly with those of her parents and siblings. \u201cWe don\u2019t mind that she is doing her own thing and that she isn\u2019t conservative like the rest of us,\u201d her father said, \u201cbut it\u2019s like we don\u2019t even recognize who she\u2019s become.\u201d\n\nAccording to her parents, Emily\u2019s \u201cadolescent nightmare\u201d began 4 years earlier. She had apparently been a studious 15-year-old girl with a lively sense of humor and a wide circle of \u201cterrific friends.\u201d \u201cAlmost overnight,\u201d she began to shun her longtime friends in favor of \u201cdropouts and malcontents\u201d and began to accumulate traffic tickets and school detentions. Instead of her former bright-eyed curiosity, Emily manifested a lack of interest in all her academic subjects, and her grades dropped from As to Ds. The parents were at an absolute loss to explain the sudden and dramatic change.\n\nThe abrupt change in performance led the psychiatrist to ask Emily to take a battery of neuropsychological tests so the results could be compared with those of tests that she had taken when she had applied to a private high school several years earlier. In particular, Emily retook two high school admissions tests: the System for Assessment and Group Evaluation (SAGE), which measures a broad array of academic and perceptual aptitudes, and the Differential Aptitude Tests (DAT), which focus on reasoning, spelling, and perceptual skills.\n\nOn the SAGE, her average percentile scores dropped from the upper 10% for a 13-year-old to the bottom 10% for an adult (and the bottom 20% for a 13-year-old). When Emily took the DAT at age 13, she scored in the highest range for ninth graders across almost all measures. Her worst result had been in spelling, where she scored at the second-highest level. Upon repeating the test at age 19, she scored below the high school average in all measures.\n\nEEG, brain CT, and T2-weighted brain MRI scans showed no evidence of structural brain damage. However, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) T2-weighted MRI displayed a clear lesion in the left frontal cortex, highly suggestive of previous injury to that region.\n\nUpon further questioning about the crucial period in which she seemed to have changed, Emily admitted to being in a traffic accident with her now ex-boyfriend, Mark. Although Emily did not recall much from this episode, she remembered that she hit her head and that she had bad headaches for many weeks thereafter. Because Emily was not bleeding and there was no damage to the car, neither Mark nor Emily reported the incident to anyone. With Emily\u2019s permission, the psychiatrist contacted Mark, who was away at college but a willing and excellent historian. He remembered the incident well. \u201cEmily hit her head very, very hard on the dashboard of my car. She was not totally unconscious but very dazed. For about 3 hours, she spoke very slowly, complained that her head hurt badly, and was confused. For about 2 hours she didn\u2019t know where she was or what day it was. She also threw up twice. I was really scared, but Emily didn\u2019t want me to worry her parents since they\u2019re so overprotective. And then she broke up with me, and we\u2019ve hardly spoken since.\u201d",

When he entered the kitchen and saw his wife sitting at the table reading the newspaper, he \u201cexploded\u201d and launched into a tirade about how \u201cbad\u201d a wife she was. When Mrs. Sandahl tried to explain her own long day, Mr. Sandahl cursed at her and broke glassware and a kitchen chair. Terrified, she ran out of the kitchen, gathered up the toddlers, and left for her mother\u2019s house a few miles away.

At about that time, he started having frequent fights with classmates that would occasionally result in trips to the principal\u2019s office. In between the altercations, he was active socially and a solid student.\n\nMr. Sandahl estimated that he had had approximately four verbal outbursts a week in recent years, generally in response to frustration, unexpected demands, or perceived insults. In addition to these heated verbal tussles, Mr. Sandahl described acts of violence about every 2 months; for example, he threw a computer monitor across the room when it started \u201cacting up,\u201d he kicked a hole in a wall when one of his children would not quit crying, and he destroyed his mobile phone during an argument with his mother.

    "vignette":"J is a mid-20s military service member living independently in the community with a partner. J has a history of multiple ACEs (ACE scale score of 10\/10), with caregivers that were both physically and emotionally abusive when J's needs were voiced, resulting in a belief that it was unacceptable, unsafe, and futile to resolve interpersonal problems with caregivers, thus creating a sense of powerlessness and helplessness. Child and family services were never involved, and no legal charges were ever laid against the family for the abuse that J endured. J struggled with containing anger since early childhood resulting in physical and verbal aggression towards peers and teachers at school and family members at home. Caregivers attempted to contain J's aggressive behavior through forced administration of psychiatric medication. While growing up, J feared others and preferred to be alone, despite longing for family and friends. Socialization with peers proved difficult, as J was easily overwhelmed by noise associated with social contact and was frequently ridiculed or misunderstood while trying to verbally communicate.\n\nAs a young adult, J left family to enter the military, which became an immediate source of attachment and social belonging. More recently, J became increasingly unable to cope with anger following an ill-suited work position and a musculoskeletal injury, resulting in frequent angry verbal altercations and threats of violence towards military peers who placed restrictions on his activities. This led to disciplinary action and isolation from the unit, which further increased anger, hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts and led to a psychiatric military assessment. During the assessment, J disclosed feelings of intense anger which eventually manifested in an attack on a family member in an amnestic dissociated state. J's history indicated that pharmacological treatments had either been ineffective or caused significant side effects. The military psychiatrist determined J ought to be considered for military discharge. This triggered flashbacks of past childhood abuse and a significant increase in rage. J refused trials of psychiatric medications in the community due to a childhood history of forced medication administration. Due to significant safety concerns and limited ability to control aggressive behavior in the community, J's military psychiatrist referred J for an inpatient admission.\n\nOn initial assessment for admission, J appeared distrustful, angry, and concerned about acting out on anger and expressed suicidal ideation. On mental status examination, J was tall and appeared neatly dressed in a military uniform. J appeared hypervigilant and intensely watchful and was well spoken, using a \u201csharp\u201d tone of voice. J provided a detailed history, demonstrating a goal-directed thought form and a high level of abstract thinking, logical analysis, and good recall. There were no delusions or hallucinations, but J endorsed prominent active suicidal ideation, with intent to act upon these thoughts if not hospitalized; however, there were no immediate, specific suicide plans.",

I needed to extract relevant data, organize it, and then reason through potential diagnoses.\n\nI started by carefully extracting information, paying attention to the patient's history. I noted the extreme ACE score, suggesting profound trauma, and the patterns of abuse and neglect. Early aggression, particularly in childhood, caught my attention. The patient's social struggles, sensory sensitivities, and the fact he was misunderstood and ridiculed were important. The military provided some structure, but the combination of a stressful job and a musculoskeletal injury caused a decompensation with aggression and suicidal ideation. A key piece of information was the amnestic state during a violent attack, triggered by the threat of discharge. I needed to keep these in mind as key symptoms.\n\nBased on the evidence I started considering the possibility of PTSD due to the 10\/10 ACE score, childhood trauma, and current flashbacks. The amnesia and anger gave me pause. I also needed to consider Borderline Personality Disorder with the intense anger and fear of abandonment. There was also a strong chance for Major Depressive Disorder given the hopelessness and suicidal ideation. I also considered Intermittent Explosive Disorder given the childhood aggression. At first, I was leaning towards that. I also saw some signs of ASD, but it would be too high-functioning, so I needed to weigh the evidence. But, as I really thought about the neurodevelopmental clues, I considered ASD more closely. The sensory issues, social deficits, and high logic, plus the way the patient was ridiculed, really pushed this to the top of the list. That meant, the IED could be reclassified and removed. I also considered Dissociative Amnesia because there was a clear incident of amnesia that was very serious. I was also going to consider Generalized Anxiety Disorder, but that was just secondary to PTSD.\n\nI then went through a process of refining. I eliminated IED because it was covered in PTSD\/BPD. However, ASD was worth the extra thought. So, I added that, replacing the IED. I needed to check on DMDD, but he's too old to get that diagnosis. However, I didn't want to get rid of the amnesia. In the end, Dissociative Amnesia fit better. I had to weigh if this was a symptom of PTSD, but it was severe and needed to be listed, so I added that. It would be a useful thing to show in the output.\n\nAfter I settled on a list, I needed to get the F-codes. I verified those, and then I needed to arrange them into an order of priority. I made the final decision: I wanted the primary diagnosis to be PTSD, then BPD because that was the personality, and then ASD to provide the underlying context. I also wanted to have MDD due to the acute symptoms. Finally, I decided on the dissociative amnesia. I checked it one final time, the symptoms, and the F-codes, and formatted the diagnoses in line with DSM-5-TR naming conventions. I considered whether IED was a better choice, but that seemed too narrow. Dissociative Amnesia better captured that.\n\nIn a last-minute decision, I went with dissociative amnesia as the most specific description. I confirmed all of that again, and then I was ready for the final output. The format must be correct, so I just had to output the diagnoses with the F-codes, as requested.\n\n\n",

    "model_thoughts":"**Initial Assessment & Diagnostic Formulation**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. The request specifies a structured psychiatric diagnosis using DSM-5-TR, with ICD-10 F-codes, for a 12-month-old. This is a level 5 task - sophisticated extraction and organization, nuanced differentials. The key here is to translate the medical\/genetic presentation into *psychiatric* terms.\n\nFirst, the vignette. Ben, 12 months, sounds like a classic *Cri-du-chat* case, given the cat-like cry, microcephaly, hypertelorism, low-set ears, hypotonia, and heart defect. The medical diagnosis itself (5p- deletion) is outside my purview here - I need *psychiatric* F-codes. The prompt emphasizes *psychiatric* diagnoses.\n\nHe's a 12-month-old, so the primary psychiatric concern, given the microcephaly and hypotonia, is global developmental delay, using F88. Standard for this presentation. Intellectual Disability is for over 5's, per DSM. Feeding issues and hypotonia are there, which makes Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder, F50.82, a good fit, given the \"problems related to feeding\" and GI involvement. Separation anxiety is mentioned; F93.0 (Separation Anxiety Disorder of Childhood) is technically on the table, although, in a 12-month-old, a *disorder* might be premature. However, the vignette highlights it.\n\nThe \"cat cry\" points to a neurological basis; the broader developmental picture implies the need for a catch-all, and Unspecified Neurodevelopmental Disorder, F89, works. The fifth - the final, the key here is to capture how that condition\/syndrome is manifesting psychiatrically, which is not obvious. Here's where the mental disorders due to other medical conditions code F06.x, comes to mind. If there is a direct physiological mechanism at play, this should be used. However, it seems the mental disorder is related to a combination of factors related to the syndrome (cognitive delay, physical symptoms).\n\nHere is the refined list:\n1.  **Global Developmental Delay** - F88\n2.  **Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder** - F50.82\n3.  **Separation Anxiety Disorder** - F93.0\n4.  **Unspecified Neurodevelopmental Disorder** - F89\n5.  **Unspecified Mental Disorder due to another medical condition** - F09\nThis will be my final list.\n\n\n",

    "vignette":"Olivia Jacobs, a 22-year-old graduate student in architecture, was referred for an urgent psychiatric consultation after she told her roommate that she was suicidal. Ms. Jacobs had a history of mood symptoms that had been under good control with lithium and sertraline, but her depressive symptoms had returned soon after she had arrived in a new city for school, 3 months earlier. She had become preoccupied with ways in which she might kill herself without inconveniencing others. Her dominant suicidal thoughts involved shooting herself in the head while leaning out the window, so as not to cause a mess in the dorm. Although she did not have access to a gun, she spent time searching the Web for places where she might purchase one.\n\nMs. Jacobs\u2019s psychiatric history began at age 15, when she began to regularly drink alcohol and smoke marijuana, usually when out at dance clubs with friends. Both of these substances calmed her, and she denied that either had become problematic. She had used neither alcohol nor marijuana since starting graduate school.\n\nAround age 17, she began experiencing brief, intense depressive episodes, marked by tearfulness, feelings of guilt, anhedonia, hopelessness, low energy, and poor concentration. She would sleep more than 12 hours a day and neglect responsibilities at school and home.\n\nThese depressive episodes would generally shift after a few weeks into periods of increased energy, pressured speech, and unusual creativity. She would stay up most of the night working on projects and building architectural models. These revved-up episodes lasted about 5 days and were punctuated by feelings that her friends had turned against her and that they were not really friends at all. Worried especially about the paranoia, her family had brought her to a psychiatrist, who diagnosed her as having bipolar II disorder and prescribed lithium and sertraline. Although Ms. Jacobs\u2019s moods did not completely stabilize on this regimen, she did well enough at a local university to be accepted into a prestigious graduate program far from home. At that point the depression returned, and she became intensely suicidal for the first time.\n\nUpon evaluation, the patient was visibly depressed and tearful, and had psychomotor slowing. She said it was very difficult to get out of bed and she was not attending class most days. She reported hopelessness, poor concentration, and guilt about spending family money for school when she was not able to perform. She stated that she thought about suicide most of the time and that she had found nothing to distract her. She denied recent drinking or smoking marijuana, stating she did not feel like \u201cpartying.\u201d She acknowledged profound feelings of emptiness and indicated that she had occasionally cut her arms superficially to \u201csee what it would feel like.\u201d She stated that she knew that cutting herself in this way would not kill her.

    "model_thoughts":"**Expert Diagnostic Reasoning - Olivia Jacobs Case**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm approaching this: First, I meticulously analyzed the request, focusing on my role as a psychiatrist tasked with a DSM-5-TR diagnosis using F-codes only and aiming for a Level 5 assessment. Next, I deeply examined the clinical vignette of Olivia Jacobs, extracting every detail \u2013 her suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms, and the crucial hypomanic episodes.  My immediate focus is on the *primary* differential: Bipolar Spectrum. The evidence for Bipolar II is strong \u2013 the distinct periods of depression and hypomania, even with her academic success. The \"paranoia\" about friends could sway it towards Bipolar I, but with the patient reporting no hospitalization, and continuing to function in grad school, it's more likely Bipolar II.\n\nThen I considered Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) due to the emptiness and cutting, but her specific denials of the core BPD criteria (impulsivity, identity issues, and fear of abandonment) made this a complex call.  Even with the patient denying the criteria, cutting and emptiness are key, so it belongs in the list as a strong consideration. Panic Disorder also came into focus, given the occasional panic attacks. The reported depersonalization felt significant, requiring attention on a *clinical* list (rather than pure \"differential\"). The substance history (alcohol and cannabis use) also needs to be addressed. \"Regular use to calm\" flags this.\n\nI carefully considered and then *ruled out* other mood diagnoses like Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Cyclothymic Disorder, as the vignette is much more consistent with Bipolar II.  I looked for, but found nothing suggesting, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder or psychotic disorders in the vignette. Based on the prompt, it would not be appropriate.\n\nFinally, I made the list, prioritizing *Bipolar II Disorder* as the primary diagnosis.  The secondary\/comorbid diagnoses include BPD as a clinical rule-out, Panic Disorder, depersonalization, and Alcohol Use Disorder to comprehensively address her clinical presentation. This ensures a complete list that is clinically sound and appropriate for a billing list.\n\n\n",

I meticulously considered each symptom, evaluating its frequency, intensity, and context. My approach involved applying the diagnostic reasoning rubric at Level 5. I focused on identifying the most likely DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses using only the provided information.\n\nI considered several potential diagnoses, starting with **Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD)**. The child's persistent irritability and frequent, severe temper outbursts fit this diagnosis well. I then considered **Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD)**, but determined that DMDD was the more fitting diagnosis. Given the pattern of physical aggression, I also gave careful thought to **Conduct Disorder (CD)**. The child's history of trauma, being a ward of the state and multiple placements, immediately led me to consider **Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD)**, but ruled it out, as the behaviors were externalizing, rather than the internalizing nature of RAD. The context of foster care also raised the possibility of a **Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder**, and I identified symptoms of post-traumatic distress. Finally, I noted potential symptoms of **Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)** and symptoms of **Anxiety**, given the impulsivity, interrupting behaviors and tearfulness, respectively.\n\nAfter reviewing all the information, I prioritized a list of five diagnoses. I believe that **Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD)** is the most accurate diagnosis because it captures the central features of the presenting problem. **Conduct Disorder** is a critical secondary diagnosis to address the repeated physical aggression toward peers. **Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder** is a likely comorbidity that I am diagnosing because of the presence of impulsivity and interrupting behaviors. Additionally, I am diagnosing **Unspecified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder** because of the history of adverse childhood experiences. And lastly, due to tearfulness and fear around hospitalization, I am diagnosing **Unspecified Anxiety Disorder**.\n\n\n",

The patient frequently punches her mother in the legs, and in the stomach, and the patient even threw her ipad at the pediatrician when she asked the patient what was upsetting her.

    "model_thoughts":"**Data Extraction and Diagnostic Reasoning: Bipolar I Disorder, an Expert's Perspective**\n\nOkay, here's how I'd approach this case, step-by-step, just like I would in practice. We've got Neveah, a 14-year-old girl with \"out of control behaviors.\"  First, I'm pulling out the key facts: age (adolescent), gender (female), chief complaint, MSE findings (restless, aggressive, irritable), developmental history, social history (father deployed, mom pregnant), and a really crucial history of present illness.  The HPI reveals episodic \"talkativeness,\" \"increased energy,\" \"decreased sleep\" without fatigue, impulsivity, grandiosity (\"superpowers\"), temper tantrums, and a history of hospitalization for similar symptoms.  No hallucinations, no depressed mood \u2013 that's vital.  She refuses medication, which is a significant factor in managing her care.\n\nThe diagnostic process begins with recognizing the episodic, classic manic presentation: the decreased sleep, grandiosity, and impulsivity immediately point to a manic episode.  Checking the DSM-5 criteria for Bipolar I is straightforward: elevated, expansive, or irritable mood, check.  Increased energy\/activity, check.  Grandiosity (superpowers), check.  Decreased need for sleep, check.  More talkative, check.  Impulsivity, check.  Impairment (hospitalization), check.  Ruling out substance\/medical causes is essential, which seems reasonable given the episodic pattern. Since she meets criteria for a manic episode, Bipolar I is primary. The absence of depression favors this diagnosis.\n\nNext, I'm thinking about the differentials, always keeping in mind the complexity of a 14-year-old girl. Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) is a classic consideration at this age, but the presence of clear manic features and the DSM-5 exclusion rules it out.  Still, I must include this in the differential. ADHD is a huge consideration, given the restlessness and impulsivity, and the prematurity history increases the risk. The episodic nature, however, points to Bipolar rather than a pervasive ADHD.  Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) is also a strong possibility given the \"out of control behaviors\" (anger, defiance). However, the episodic nature of her behavior rules this out. Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) is another differential given the outbursts. But IED is also not a primary. Adjustment disorder comes to mind, given the family stressors (father deployed, mother pregnant), but the symptoms are too severe and cyclical for that alone. Substance-Induced Bipolar is a must-consider, though there's no mention of substance use here. Bipolar due to medical condition, given the history, is unlikely. Schizoaffective needs to be ruled out (no hallucinations, so less likely).\n\nRefining the differential is key.  Bipolar I is the primary. Given the evidence and the fact that she has psychotic features, the primary diagnosis is Bipolar I with current manic episode, severe, with psychotic features, coded F31.2. The next differential, given the overlap in symptoms and risk factors, is ADHD (F90.2). This captures the in-office restlessness. Next is Conduct Disorder (F91.2), reflecting the violence and destruction (punching, iPad throwing).  Then, ODD (F91.3) because if the aggression doesn't fully fit Conduct Disorder, ODD captures the defiance and tantrums.  Finally, Adjustment Disorder with Disturbance of Conduct (F43.24) can explain how the family stressors trigger and worsen the presenting symptoms.  If I need an alternative for number five, it is Unspecified Impulse-Control, Disruptive, and Conduct Disorder (F91.9).\n\nOne challenge: The \"normal periods\" between episodes mean I need to really consider what to do about the chronic diagnoses - are they truly separate, or only present during an episode? The request for \"5 diagnoses\" can be tricky.  If she is \"returning to normal mood\" between episodes, the other diagnoses are very hard to make, and they are essentially symptoms of mania. This suggests that the best way to report this is a *differential* list of likely diagnoses.\n\nSo, in the end, it's:\n\n1.  Bipolar I Disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features (F31.2).\n2.  Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder, combined presentation (F90.2).\n3.  Conduct Disorder, adolescent-onset type (F91.2).\n4.  Oppositional Defiant Disorder (F91.3).\n5.  Adjustment Disorder with disturbance of conduct (F43.24).\n\nThis represents my best approach. This list is my top differential for this patient\n\n",

    "vignette":"Ashley, age 17, was referred for a diagnostic reevaluation after having carried diagnoses of autism and intellectual disability for almost all of her life. She was recently found to have Kleefstra syndrome, and the family wanted to reconfirm the earlier diagnoses and assess the genetic risk to the future children of her older sisters.\n\nAt the time of the reevaluation, Ashley was attending a special school with a focus on functional skills. She was able to dress herself, but she was not able to shower independently or be left alone in the house. She was able to decode (e.g., read words) and spell at a second-grade level but understood little of what she read. Changes to her schedule and heightened functional expectations tended to make her irritable. When upset, Ashley would often hurt herself (e.g., biting her wrist) and others (e.g., pinching and hair pulling).\n\nIn formal testing done at the time of the reevaluation, Ashley had a nonverbal IQ of 39 and a verbal IQ of 23, with a full scale IQ of 31. Her adaptive scores were somewhat higher, with an overall score of 42 (with 100 as average).\n\nBy history, Ashley first received services at age 9 months after her parents noticed significant motor delays. She walked at 20 months and was toilet trained at 5 years. She spoke her first word at age 6. She received a diagnosis of developmental delay at age 3 and of autism, obesity, and static encephalopathy at age 4. An early evaluation noted possible facial dysmorphology; genetic tests at that time were noncontributory.\n\nHer parents indicated that Ashley knew hundreds of single words and many simple phrases. She had long been very interested in license plates and would draw them for hours. Her strongest skill was memory, and she could draw precise representations of license plates from different states. Ashley had always been very attached to her parents and sisters, and although affectionate toward babies, she showed minimal interest in other teenagers.\n\nAshley\u2019s family history was pertinent for a father with dyslexia, a paternal uncle with epilepsy, and a maternal male cousin with possible \u201cAsperger\u2019s syndrome.\u201d Her siblings, both sisters, were in college and doing well.\n\nOn examination, Ashley was an overweight young woman who made inconsistent eye contact but often peered out the corner of her eye. She had a beautiful smile and would sometimes laugh to herself, but most of the time her facial expressions were subdued. She did not initiate joint attention by trying to catch another person\u2019s eyes. She frequently ignored what others would say to her. To request a preferred object (e.g., a shiny magazine), Ashley would rock from foot to foot and point. When offered an object (e.g., a small decorated box), she brought it to her nose and lips for inspection. Ashley spoke in a high-pitched voice with unusual intonation. During the interview, she used multiple words and a few short phrases that were somewhat rote but communicative, such as \u201cI want to clean up,\u201d and \u201cDo you have a van?\u201d\n\nIn the months prior to the evaluation, Ashley\u2019s parents noticed that she had become increasingly apathetic. A medical evaluation concluded that urinary tract infections were the most likely cause for her symptoms, but antibiotics seemed only to make her more listless. Further medical evaluation led to more extensive genetic testing, and Ashley was diagnosed with Kleefstra syndrome, a rare genetic defect associated with multiple medical problems, including intellectual developmental disorder. The parents said they were also tested and found to \u201cbe negative.\u201d\n\nThe parents specifically wanted to know whether the genetic testing results affected Ashley\u2019s long-standing diagnoses and access to future services. Furthermore, they wanted to know whether their other two daughters should get tested for their risk of carrying genes for autism, intellectual disability, and\/or Kleefstra syndrome.",

All the information was essential for me to generate an accurate diagnostic list.\n\nFrom there, I needed to reason through the diagnoses using DSM-5-TR criteria.\n\n*   I started with **Intellectual Disability**. Ashley's IQ (31) pointed to the Severe range, but her adaptive functioning, particularly her ability to read at a 2nd-grade level and communicate with phrases, suggested a **Moderate** level. I placed more weight on the DSM's emphasis on adaptive skills.\n*   **Autism Spectrum Disorder** was straightforward, given the clear social deficits, repetitive behaviors, and restricted interests.\n*   The \"wrist biting\" led me to **Stereotypic Movement Disorder**, even though it was secondary to the ASD.\n*   The new symptoms of increasing apathy and listlessness was tricky. The Kleefstra syndrome connection with regression\/mood disorders in adolescence had to be considered. I explored all diagnostic possibilities, including **Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition** (F06.31).\n*   Lastly, I needed to address her language deficits.

    "vignette":"George Anderson, a 73-year-old married man, was referred to a psychiatrist for an evaluation of depression after screening positive on the Geriatric Depression Scale during a neurology appointment. For most of the 2 years since his diagnosis with Parkinson\u2019s disease, Mr. Anderson had coped well and continued to engage in many of his usual activities. His wife of 49 years noted that 1\u20132 years before developing Parkinson\u2019s disease, Mr. Anderson had become somewhat less enthusiastic and motivated compared with his baseline personality, but not to the point of causing any concern or impairment. The only other neuropsychiatric symptom preceding his Parkinson\u2019s diagnosis was his wife\u2019s report that during the past 5 years he frequently \u201cthrashed about\u201d while asleep.\n\nThree months prior to the referral, however, Mr. Anderson began to decline social invitations from family and friends. He reported that he had withdrawn socially because he had lost pleasure in things that used to excite him, although he denied persistent feelings of sadness or worry. He recognized that he was not his \u201cusual self\u201d and tried, to no avail, to give himself \u201cpep talks.\u201d He had worked as a high school science teacher until retirement at age 67, and reported having learned \u201cthe power of seeing the glass half full\u201d from his students. He felt frustrated that he could not \u201csnap out of it\u201d for the first time in his life but was hopeful about getting professional help. He denied wishing for death, explaining that although he was not afraid of death, he wanted to enjoy life as long as possible. He added, \u201cGod does not give me more than I can handle. I can\u2019t ask for a better family, and I have had a full life.\u201d\n\nOther new symptoms over the prior few months included increasing fatigue, impaired concentration and memory, unintentional weight loss, and sleep-onset insomnia. Further history on his more chronic sleep symptoms revealed that, around 3:00 a.m. or 4:00 a.m. on most nights, Mr. Anderson began violently moving his extremities and moaning as though in distress, all while still seemingly asleep in bed. He often awakened his wife with these movements and occasionally struck her in his sleep. She sometimes used a different bedroom because of this. When he awoke from such an incident, he was coherent and briefly anxious, often reporting that he had been dreaming of swimming or running from something.\n\nHis wife took over driving shortly after his Parkinson\u2019s disease diagnosis, but Mr. Anderson was otherwise independent in activities of daily living such as paying bills and managing his medications. His wife described him as \u201cmaybe a little more forgetful\u201d over the past few years, but neither of them was concerned about this mild memory loss.\n\nPast medical history included prostate cancer (in remission), glaucoma, and gout. Labs from his recent neurology visit were unremarkable, including blood counts, serum chemistries, thyroid function, and vitamin B12 levels. Family psychiatric history was positive only for a granddaughter with ADHD. He denied past problematic substance use and all current substance use except two or three glasses of wine monthly. He denied any previous depressive episodes, psychiatric treatment, or psychiatric evaluations.\n\nOn mental status examination, Mr. Anderson was pleasant, cooperative, and interpersonally engaging. Resting tremor, shuffling gait, hypophonia, and bradykinesia all were evident at mild to moderate levels. He occasionally smiled, but his affect was difficult to fully gauge because of masked facies. He reported his mood as \u201cblah.\u201d There was no evidence of psychosis.\n\nOn cognitive testing, he had some difficulty on the Trail Making Test part B, figure copying, and word-list recall, the latter being helped by category prompts. On a standardized brief cognitive assessment, he scored 25 out of 30 points, which was in the normal range.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Here's how I'm thinking about this case:**\n\nAlright, I'm approaching this like a seasoned psychiatrist, aiming for Level 5 ACGME proficiency. First, I break down the request. I know my role: expert psychiatrist. The task: diagnose George Anderson, a 73-year-old man, based on the provided clinical vignette. The rules are clear: stick to DSM-5-TR criteria, provide a structured list of the top five diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes, and no reasoning in the final output. Crucially, I have to stick to F-codes only, which means no G-codes. This is a bit of a tricky constraint, especially given the neurological aspect of the case.\n\nNext, I dive into the data extraction and organization. George comes in with depression, screening positive on a geriatric depression scale. I meticulously extract the relevant details: his Parkinson's Disease history (diagnosed two years ago, but some prodromal symptoms), the onset of depressive symptoms (anhedonia, social withdrawal, sleep problems), functional status, medical history, lab results (unremarkable), and a quick mental status exam. I'm noting everything, from his 'blah' mood to the masked facies, and that he's still independent in his ADLs. The cognitive testing data (Trail Making B difficulty, visuospatial issues) is crucial for assessing potential neurocognitive decline.\n\nNow, I'm in diagnostic reasoning mode, starting with symptom clusters. The first one is the mood\/affective symptoms: anhedonia, fatigue, weight loss, insomnia, and the withdrawal. These cluster together, and given the context of Parkinson's, the most accurate diagnosis is \"Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition.\" I'm ruling out Major Depressive Disorder, because the medical link to Parkinson's makes the 'due to another medical condition' more precise. I'm also ruling out Adjustment Disorder, because these symptoms are too severe and seem to have a physiological component.\n\nThe sleep disturbance is the second cluster: thrashing, moaning, violent movements, and enacting dreams, happening in REM sleep. This is textbook Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD). RBD frequently occurs in the prodrome or alongside alpha-synucleinopathies like Parkinson's. This is my 'a-ha' moment, but here's where the F-code constraint kicks in. RBD has a G-code, not an F-code. This is where I'll need to do some creative thinking to find a good equivalent, if possible.\n\nThird cluster is cognition. The subjective memory loss, difficulty with executive function, and visuospatial issues are all evidence of cognitive decline. But, his preserved function is the key here. It doesn't interfere with his independence in ADLs, which makes this a \"Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease.\" I'm ruling out Major NCD, because he's still independent.\n\nThe final cluster is personality change, specifically, apathy, a lack of enthusiasm prior to the PD diagnosis. This is common in PD and it is a diagnostic challenge. Is it part of the depressive disorder or a distinct issue?\n\nNow, I start synthesizing, creating the top 5 diagnoses. The primary diagnosis is obviously the \"Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition\" (F06.32), because it is the reason for referral and is etiologically linked to the Parkinson's. The second one is trickier. Given that I have the F-code restraint, the \"Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition\" is next (F06.7) - I'll need to remember that code. I am now stuck at what to do about RBD, since I need to use an F-code. Looking through F-codes, the best I can do is a \"Nightmare Disorder\" (F51.5) to capture the dream component. Now, how to capture sleep onset problems. I'll add \"Insomnia Disorder\" (F51.01). Now, I need a fifth diagnosis and the best is \"Personality change due to another medical condition\" (F07.0) to capture the pre-PD prodrome of apathy and loss of enthusiasm, which can occur separate from the depression. Now, I have to be sure to check the code restraint - it is *only* F-codes.\n\nHere, I'm faced with this RBD\/F-code dilemma: to strictly follow the prompt, I *must* exclude RBD (which is a core clinical element). That's clinically negligent, especially with a Level 5 lens. Can I find any F-code that comes close to what I am thinking? There is a code for Nightmare disorder (F51.5), which gets close, but it is not a perfect fit. I could use \"Other specified mental disorder due to another medical condition\" (\n\n",

    "vignette":"A psychiatric transplant liaison service was called to evaluate Robert Jennings, a 50-year-old married white man, for a liver transplant in the context of an alcohol use disorder, advanced cirrhosis, and no other prior psychiatric history. Several weeks earlier, he had been hospitalized with acute alcohol-associated hepatitis and diagnosed with end-stage liver disease. Prednisolone 40 mg\/day was prescribed for treatment of the hepatitis. Prior to that hospitalization, he had been unaware that his alcohol consumption was seriously damaging his health and was shocked to learn that he would eventually require a liver transplant. Upon discharge, he began an addiction treatment program that was mandatory for him to be listed for possible transplantation.\n\nOutpatient psychiatric consultation was requested by the transplant team after the patient\u2019s family expressed concern that he had recently become increasingly irritable and anxious and seemed to be having difficulty coping with the requirements for transplantation. Mr. Jennings\u2019s primary care physician had recently prescribed alprazolam 0.5 mg as needed for his anxiety. This was initially helpful, but after several days his family noticed he seemed more irritable, lethargic, and forgetful.\n\nWhen interviewed, the patient said that he had been tired for months prior to the diagnosis and that the fatigue had hampered his ability to work (his job required making deliveries for a shipping firm). Although the diagnosis had been a shock, he said he had left the hospital feeling \u201cgreat, better than I\u2019d felt in years.\u201d For about a week after discharge, he described having enhanced energy and a sense of well-being, but he then began to feel anxious and restless. He slept poorly, unable to concentrate, and worried constantly about his health, finances, and family. He became less engaged with his family and stopped watching movies, normally his favorite pastime.\n\nHe denied having nightmares, flashbacks, avoidant behaviors, or racing thoughts. He also denied low mood, tearfulness, appetite changes, anhedonia, helplessness, hopelessness, or suicidality. He reported that he had started drinking daily 10 years earlier, stating that he enjoyed the taste of beer and liked socializing with friends after work. He developed tolerance to alcohol, needing to consume six to eight drinks per night to achieve the same effect. He described some withdrawal symptoms in the morning but did not drink during work hours; he underwent random testing due to his job as a truck driver. He did miss some family activities, preferring to drink, and this had been a source of marital conflict. He admitted feeling guilty about his alcohol use and its impact on him and his family. He denied using any alcohol since his hospitalization. He admitted to anger over having to undergo addiction counseling and had argued with the transplant team about this requirement. He denied having been an anxious person and considered himself able to handle most of life\u2019s challenges without being overwhelmed. His family confirmed his description of himself and viewed his recent behavior as uncharacteristic.\n\nOn mental status examination, Mr. Jennings was a thin, jaundiced, tired-appearing man. His gait was normal, but he was fidgety while seated. He maintained eye contact and responded appropriately, although he repeatedly made comments like, \u201cSomething isn\u2019t right\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s not all in my head.\u201d His affect was anxious and irritable, and his speech was terse. He appeared distracted but denied confusion and disorientation. He had no delusions or hallucinations. His thoughts were logical and coherent, without disorganization, and there was no latency to his responses. He scored 26 out of 30 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, missing points for recall and serial 7s. He scored in the normal range for Trail Making Test A and B but asked to have the instructions repeated for Trails B.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Alright, here's what I'm thinking:** This patient presents a complex clinical picture, and I've worked through this systematically, keeping the DSM-5-TR criteria and the ACGME Milestones framework firmly in mind. My first step was a thorough analysis of the patient's information, really drilling down into the details of his medical and psychiatric history, substance use, and the timeline of his symptoms. This information is key to pinpointing the origin of his presentation.\n\nI zeroed in on the interplay of his end-stage liver disease (ESLD), the recent initiation of high-dose prednisolone, and his history of heavy alcohol use (now in remission). These are major players in his current state. I considered each of these aspects, carefully weighing the possibility of a primary anxiety disorder versus a disorder due to a medical condition. The timing of symptom onset, with the steroid initiation and the \"feeling great\" period, strongly suggests a substance\/medication-induced anxiety disorder. The cognitive decline is most likely Hepatic Encephalopathy made worse by a benzo. I also have to consider the psychological impact of his serious diagnosis, so I needed to address that.\n\nI used my knowledge of the DSM-5-TR to guide my diagnostic reasoning. I considered potential differential diagnoses, eliminating possibilities based on the specific symptoms and timeline. I had to weigh Delirium versus Mild Neurocognitive Disorder, and the specific codes to use. Finally, I crafted a ranked list of diagnoses, each with its corresponding ICD-10 F-code, keeping in mind the need for clarity and accuracy. I'm confident in the final diagnoses.\n\n\n",

    "vignette":"Peter Winters, a 46-year-old married white minister, was referred to the psychiatry outpatient department by his primary care doctor for depressive symptoms and opioid misuse in the setting of chronic right knee pain.\n\nMr. Winters injured his right knee playing basketball 17 months earlier. His mother gave him several tablets of hydrocodone-acetaminophen that she had for back pain, and he found this helpful. When he ran out of the pills and his pain persisted, he went to the emergency room. He was told he had a mild sprain. He was given a 1-month supply of hydrocodone-acetaminophen. He took the pills as prescribed for 1 month, and his pain resolved.\n\nAfter stopping the pills, however, Mr. Winters began to experience a recurrence of the pain in his knee. He saw an orthopedist, who ordered imaging studies and determined that there was no structural damage. Mr. Winters was given another 1-month supply of hydrocodone-acetaminophen. This time, however, he needed to take more than prescribed in order to ease the pain. He also felt dysphoric and \u201cachy\u201d when he abstained from taking the medication, and described a \u201ccraving\u201d for more opioids. He returned to the orthopedist, who referred him to a pain specialist.\n\nMr. Winters was too embarrassed to go to the pain specialist, believing that his faith and strength should help him overcome the pain. He found it impossible to live without the pain medication, however, because of the pain, dysphoria, and muscle aches when he stopped the medication. He also began to \u201cenjoy the high\u201d and experienced intense craving. He began to frequent emergency rooms to receive more opioids, often lying about the timing and nature of his right knee pain, and even stole pills from his mother on two occasions. He became preoccupied with trying to find more opioids, and his work and home life suffered. He endorsed low mood, especially when contemplating the impact of opioids on his life, but denied any other mood or neurovegetative symptoms. Eventually, he told his primary care doctor about his opioid use and low mood, and that doctor referred him to the outpatient psychiatry clinic.\n\nMr. Winters had a history of two lifetime major depressive episodes that were treated successfully with escitalopram by his primary care doctor. He also had a history of an alcohol use disorder when he was in his 20s. He managed to quit using alcohol on his own after a family intervention. He smoked two packs of cigarettes daily. His father suffered from depression, and \u201calmost everyone\u201d on his mother\u2019s side of the family had \u201cissues with addiction.\u201d He had been married to his wife for 20 years, and they had two school-age children. He had been a minister in his church for 15 years. Results of a recent physical examination and laboratory testing performed by his primary care physician had been within normal limits.\n\nOn mental status examination, Mr. Winters was cooperative and did not exhibit any psychomotor abnormalities. He answered most questions briefly, often simply saying \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d Speech was of a normal rate and tone, without tangentiality or circumstantiality. He reported that his mood was \u201clousy,\u201d and his affect was dysphoric and constricted. He denied symptoms of paranoia or hallucinations. He denied any thoughts of harming himself or others.

    "model_thoughts":"**Final Diagnostic Formulation**\n\nOkay, here's my thought process. I need to be precise, adhering to the DSM-5-TR and the ICD-10 codes. My role is that of an expert psychiatrist, so I must consider subtle cues and patterns, and provide a nuanced differential even though the output is restricted. This patient presents with a complex interplay of substance use and mood symptoms. The key here is to determine whether the current mood disturbance meets full Major Depressive Episode criteria or is better explained by the opioid use.\n\nFirstly, the core issue seems to be **Opioid Use Disorder**. The patient clearly meets many criteria: using larger amounts than intended, unsuccessful efforts to cut down, spending significant time obtaining opioids, craving, failure to fulfill obligations, social problems (theft), and continued use despite a psychological problem (low mood). The tolerance and withdrawal are also present, which underscores moderate to severe OUD. I'll need to code this correctly, and given the severity, this will be F11.20, *Opioid use disorder, severe*.\n\nNext, his current mood is depressive, which also needs a clear diagnosis. While he has a history of MDD, the current symptoms are tied to opioid withdrawal and do not meet the full criteria for an MDE. This is where I have to be careful. Because his mood is so closely linked to the opioid cycle, and he *denies* other neurovegetative symptoms, the most accurate diagnosis is **Opioid-Induced Depressive Disorder**. This is a secondary diagnosis (F11.24) that best captures the current presentation and the relationship between the substance use and his mood.\n\nNow, let's address other substance use. The patient smokes 2 packs of cigarettes daily, which suggests a high degree of **Tobacco Use Disorder**. While the prompt doesn't delve deeply into other criteria like craving, 2 packs a day is high. I'll list this as a comorbidity, and after double-checking my coding, this will be F17.210, *Nicotine dependence, cigarettes, uncomplicated*.\n\nThe past diagnosis of MDD is still very relevant, but since he doesn't meet the full criteria now, this requires a specific code that indicates the history. The best fit here, in my estimation, is **Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, in full remission**. The past diagnoses are real, but I can't say he currently has the full depression. This gets the appropriate code of F33.42.\n\nAnd finally, the patient has a history of alcohol use disorder, which is key. While he is currently abstinent, this history is clinically significant and should be documented. Therefore, the last item on the list is **Alcohol Use Disorder, in remission**. The code will be F10.21.\n\nI considered other diagnoses, such as Somatic Symptom Disorder, given the chronic knee pain. However, that pain seems to stem from opioid withdrawal (and hyperalgesia) and resolves after the addiction. This is better explained by the substance use rather than a primary somatic disorder. Also, an Adjustment Disorder does not capture the clear substance etiology.\n\nTherefore, after going through all the codes, double-checking, and ensuring accuracy, the final list is:\n\n1.  Opioid use disorder, severe - F11.20\n2.  Opioid-induced depressive disorder - F11.24\n3.  Tobacco use disorder - F17.210\n4.  Major depressive disorder, recurrent, in full remission - F33.42\n5.  Alcohol use disorder, in remission - F10.21\n\n\n",

    "vignette":"The patient is an 18-year-old non-binary college freshman with a complex psychiatric presentation. They report a history of childhood anxiety, perfectionism, and ritualistic self-punishment behaviors starting in the third grade. Currently, their most debilitating symptom is anxiety about \"contaminated air\" when others cough or sneeze, prompting them to cover their face and hold their breath even when the trigger is far away or on television. They engage in checking and counting behaviors based on the number 3, including checking mirrors while driving, locking\/unlocking their car, and tapping their toothbrush. These compulsions are experienced as uncontrollable, with the patient reporting they sometimes modify behaviors (like holding an imaginary door handle in their pocket) when the original compulsion would be disruptive. At approximately age 16, the patient developed anorexia nervosa, restricting their food intake and ultimately requiring intervention from parents and a treatment team. Despite gaining weight under external pressure, the patient continues to restrict eating, has a distinct fear of gaining weight, becoming fat, fasting until dinner, drinking coffee to intentionally upset their stomach. Their BMI currently falls within the normal range. Around the same time their eating disorder developed, the patient experienced depressive symptoms including hopelessness, low motivation, and self-harm behaviors (pulling hair, cutting, punching stomach). They had suicidal ideation during high school, including thoughts of jumping in front of a train and fantasizing about wandering into hallways during a school shooting. Current suicidal thoughts are less frequent and persistent. Current depressive symptoms have been subsyndromal (though not entirely absent) for about 7 months. Specifically, the patient currently denies experiencing depressive symptoms for more than a few hours every couple of weeks but rates their chance of self-harm in the next three months at 50% (suicide attempt chance at 0%). They report minimal alcohol and marijuana use. Notably, the patient expresses resistance to treatment, stating that \"getting better means getting fat\" and feeling they need to \"stay sad for a while longer\".",

    "model_thoughts":"**Alright, let's break this down.**  As a seasoned clinician, I'm going to distill the complex information in this vignette into a concise and accurate diagnostic list, keeping in mind the patient's presentation and history. My immediate focus is on applying the DSM-5-TR criteria and the ICD-10 codes, prioritizing the most likely and clinically significant diagnoses.\n\n*   **Initial Impression:** This 18-year-old presents with a challenging constellation of symptoms \u2013 OCD, an eating disorder history, depressive features, and self-harming behaviors. It's crucial to identify the most debilitating and central issues.\n*   **OCD is the Driver:** The pervasive nature of the obsessive-compulsive symptoms, including the anxiety about contamination, the specific rituals, and the distress and impairment these behaviors cause, jump out. This firmly establishes **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (F42.2)** as a primary concern.\n*   **Eating Disorder Nuances:**  The patient's history of anorexia nervosa, combined with current restrictive behaviors and a persistent fear of weight gain despite a normal BMI, presents a diagnostic challenge. Based on the history, this is **Anorexia Nervosa, Restricting Type (F50.01)** in *partial remission*. Given the normal BMI, this could alternatively be considered **Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (F50.8)** - Atypical Anorexia Nervosa. However, given the history of restriction, F50.01 seems most appropriate to capture the full picture of the patient.\n*   **Mood Disorder Considerations:** The patient's history of depression, including suicidal ideation, and the current subsyndromal depressive symptoms necessitate careful evaluation.  Given the complex history, a diagnosis of **Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, In Partial Remission (F33.41)** feels like the best fit, highlighting the cyclical nature of the mood challenges.\n*   **The Hair Pulling Conundrum:** The hair pulling is mentioned. Given this is not the main reason for the visit.  A diagnosis of **Trichotillomania (F63.3)** is warranted, as this behavior is often distinct from other self-harming behaviors.\n*   **Underlying Anxiety:** The report of \"childhood anxiety\" warrants a diagnosis that will capture that. I will select **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1)**, as this likely contributes to and exacerbates all of the other conditions.\n\n*   **Final List:**\n    1.  **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (F42.2)**\n    2.  **Anorexia Nervosa, Restricting Type (in partial remission) (F50.01)**\n    3.  **Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, In Partial Remission (F33.41)**\n    4.  **Trichotillomania (Hair-Pulling Disorder) (F63.3)**\n    5.  **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1)**\n\nThis diagnostic formulation prioritizes the most clinically salient information, providing a strong foundation for future evaluation and treatment planning.

Crucially, she lacks insight into her delusions. Labs are normal, and her mental status exam reveals agitation, poverty of speech, and persistence in her delusions. There's a history of increased alcohol use, likely self-medication.\n\nThe analysis immediately gravitates toward a Major Depressive Episode. She meets the criteria for depressed mood, weight loss, insomnia, agitation, fatigue, diminished thinking, and suicidal ideation, for an adequate duration and significant functional impairment. The presence of clear, mood-congruent delusions leads me to consider the \"With Psychotic Features\" specifier.\n\nThis leads to the *top priority*: **Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Severe, With Psychotic Features (F32.3)**. It's the most straightforward fit.\n\nThe differential broadens. Given the psychosis, **Schizoaffective Disorder, Depressive Type (F25.1)** becomes a strong consideration.  However, the vignette indicates the psychosis is linked to the depression, making it less likely than MDD with psychotic features. Longitudinal data would be ideal to fully rule this one in or out.\n\nNext, I can't ignore the possibility of **Bipolar I Disorder, Current Episode Depressed, Severe, With Psychotic Features (F31.5)**. While she denies a history of mania, this can be the initial presentation. Age of onset is on the later side but not impossible, and a family history of depression (even if imprecise) adds weight.\n\nThen I considered **Delusional Disorder (F22)**, because the delusions are persistent. But her overall presentation suggests the depressive syndrome is primary and the delusional elements secondary to the mood disturbance (as opposed to the other way around).\n\nFinally, I have to address the alcohol use. Increased intake to manage insomnia raises the concern for **Alcohol Use Disorder, Mild (F10.10)**. Although the alcohol use isn't *causing* the psychotic depression, it's a comorbidity or contributing factor that's relevant to both her insomnia and treatment plan. It is a secondary concern.\n\nMy final diagnoses are:\n\n1.  Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe with psychotic features - F32.3\n2.  Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type - F25.1\n3.  Bipolar I disorder, current episode depressed, severe with psychotic features - F31.5\n4.  Delusional disorder - F22\n5.

    "model_thoughts":"**My Expert-Level Diagnostic Thoughts:**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We have a 36-year-old female with a history of Major Depressive Disorder, off her Zoloft for six months, and presenting with pretty classic catatonic symptoms. My initial thought is, of course, a return of the MDD, probably severe given the functional impairment and not eating. The catatonia is a big red flag, and the \"clasp-knife\" description initially made me think neurological, but that's likely a phrasing issue from someone not in the field or a subtle aspect of waxy flexibility. We can't jump to conclusions without more data.\n\nSo, first and foremost, the *primary* diagnosis has to be the MDD, but it's *with* catatonia. I\u2019d code that as F33.2 with F06.1 for the catatonia specifier because that's the best fit for DSM-5-TR. It's a severe depressive episode, and she ticks enough catatonic boxes to justify the specifier.\n\nHowever, we need to think beyond that. Given the catatonia, Bipolar Disorder is definitely a strong differential. It\u2019s important to exclude mania or hypomania in her history and make the differential. That's F31.4, which is Bipolar I, depressed, severe with the catatonia.\n\nNext, we have to consider Schizoaffective Disorder, Depressive Type. The \u201cbizarre behavior\u201d could be interpreted as psychotic features, even if the primary issue is mood. It's crucial to check if the catatonia is purely mood-congruent or if there's an independent psychotic process. If it isn't completely mood-congruent, this becomes much more likely, coded as F25.1.\n\nAnd, of course, schizophrenia has to be on the table. The catatonia *could* be a feature of a Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder, even though the MDD history makes that less likely. We code this one as F20.9 (Schizophrenia) to be thorough.\n\nSo there it is:\n1.  Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe (F33.2)\n2.  Catatonia associated with another mental disorder (F06.1)\n3.  Bipolar I disorder, current episode depressed, severe (F31.4)\n4.  Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type (F25.1)\n5.  Schizophrenia (F20.9)\n\nWe cover all the bases - primary diagnosis, catatonic syndrome, and the main differentials. It is important to treat this patient as soon as possible because the severity of catatonia can increase risk of harm to self and others. Remember to work quickly and gather additional information for a more accurate diagnosis.\n\n\n",

    "vignette":"Nadine was a 15-year-old girl whose mother brought her for a psychiatric evaluation to help with her long-standing shyness.\n\nAlthough Nadine was initially reluctant to say much about herself, she said she felt constantly tense. She added that the anxiety had been \u201creally bad\u201d for several years and was often accompanied by episodes of dizziness and crying. She was generally unable to speak in any situation outside of her home or school classes. She refused to leave her house alone for fear of being forced to interact with someone. She was especially anxious around other teenagers, but she had also become \u201ctoo nervous\u201d to speak to adult neighbors she had known for years. She said it felt impossible to walk into a restaurant and order from \u201ca stranger at the counter\u201d for fear of being humiliated. She also felt constantly on her guard, needing to avoid the possibility of getting attacked, a strategy that really only worked when she was alone in her home.\n\nNadine tried to conceal her crippling anxiety from her parents, typically telling them that she \u201cjust didn\u2019t feel like\u201d going out. Feeling trapped and incompetent, Nadine said she contemplated suicide \u201call the time.\u201d In the month before her mother finally brought her in for a psychiatric evaluation, Nadine had begun to cut herself on her thighs to \u201cfeel pain and relieve stress.\u201d No one in the family was aware of this development.\n\nNadine had always been \u201cshy\u201d and had been teased at recess since she started kindergarten. The teasing had escalated to outright bullying by the time she was in seventh grade. The bullying took on a cultural\/racially motivated undertone; Nadine and her family were of a different ethnicity than the vast majority of her schoolmates. For 2 years, day after difficult day, Nadine\u2019s peers turned on her \u201clike a snarling wolf pack,\u201d calling her \u201cstupid,\u201d \u201cugly,\u201d and \u201ccrazy.\u201d Not infrequently, one of them would stare at her and tell her she would be better off committing suicide. One girl (the ringleader, as well as a former elementary school chum) hit Nadine on one occasion, giving her a black eye. Nadine did not fight back. This event was witnessed by an adult neighbor, who told Nadine\u2019s mother. When Nadine\u2019s mother asked her about the incident, Nadine denied it, saying she had \u201cfallen\u201d on the street. She did, however, mention to her mother \u201cin passing\u201d that she wanted to switch schools, but her delivery was so offhand that at the time, her mother casually advised against the switch. Nadine suffered on, sobbing herself to sleep most nights and wishing that she would not wake up.\n\nFull of hope and ideas of escape from the bullies and their narrowness, Nadine transferred to a specialty arts high school for ninth grade. Although the bullying ceased, her anxiety symptoms paradoxically worsened. She felt even more unable to venture into public spaces and felt increasingly embarrassed by her inability to develop the sort of independence typical of a 15-year-old. She said she had begun to spend whole weekends \u201ctrapped\u201d in her home and had become scared to even read by herself in the local park. Nadine\u2019s social anxiety had evolved into true agoraphobia. She had nightly nightmares about the bullies in her old school. Her preoccupation with suicide grew.\n\nHer parents had thought she would outgrow being shy and sought psychiatric help for her only after a teacher remarked that her anxiety and social isolation were keeping her from making the sort of grades and doing the sort of extracurricular activities that were necessary to get into a good college.\n\nNadine described her mother as loud, excitable, aggressive, and \u201ca little frightening.\u201d Her father was a successful tax attorney who worked long hours. Nadine described him as shy in social situations (\u201cHe\u2019s more like me\u201d). Nadine said she and her father sometimes joked that the goal of any evening was to avoid tipping the mother into a rage. Nadine added that she \u201cnever wanted to be anything like her mother.\u201d",

    "model_thoughts":"**My Assessment of Nadine's Case**\n\nAs I delve into Nadine's case, my primary focus is to methodically extract and organize the complex clinical picture presented. My analysis begins by establishing the core framework: I am a psychiatrist, tasked with formulating a diagnosis based on a detailed clinical vignette, strictly adhering to the DSM-5-TR criteria. My goal is to achieve a Level 5 performance, meaning I must not only accurately identify the relevant data, but also demonstrate a sophisticated understanding of subtle diagnostic nuances. The final output needs to be a prioritized list of diagnoses with corresponding ICD-10 codes, with no supporting rationale.\n\nStarting with the initial presentation, \"long-standing shyness\" suggests a foundational element. However, the severity of her symptomatology goes far beyond a simple personality trait. The constant tension, episodes of dizziness and crying, and the inability to communicate outside her home all point towards a significant anxiety disorder. The history of severe bullying, including racial slurs, physical assault, and the ongoing nightmares, immediately raises the possibility of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. The fear of humiliation and social situations point towards Social Anxiety Disorder, and the agoraphobic features are also prominent. The suicidal ideation and self-harm further add a layer of complexity, indicating the presence of a depressive episode.\n\nMy diagnostic reasoning involves a meticulous differential process. Social Anxiety Disorder seems like a strong initial contender due to her fear of scrutiny and negative evaluation. However, the history of trauma is compelling, suggesting PTSD. Agoraphobia is also present. The symptoms of major depression\u2014sobbing, suicidal ideation, and self-harm\u2014are clearly present. Furthermore, the persistent feeling of being \"trapped,\" the hypervigilance, and the nightmares are all PTSD symptoms that require careful consideration. A secondary concern is Selective Mutism, given her inability to speak outside her home and school, but the information about her speaking in school causes me to consider how much this would be better classified as severe Social Anxiety Disorder. The pervasive nature of her anxiety also leads me to evaluate for Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Additionally, the possibility of an Avoidant Personality Disorder is considered, given the long-standing social inhibition and feelings of inadequacy.\n\nIn the process of synthesis, I begin to prioritize the diagnoses. While PTSD stems from a distinct traumatic event, Social Anxiety Disorder appears to be the most pervasive and chronic issue, explaining many of her functional impairments. This brings me to the core question: Which should be primary, PTSD or Social Anxiety Disorder? The prompt provides the context that her social anxiety evolved into agoraphobia. Social Anxiety Disorder fits, with PTSD and Agoraphobia as comorbid conditions, as well as Major Depressive Disorder, and Avoidant Personality Disorder.\n\nIn finalizing the diagnoses, I re-evaluate each to ensure accuracy. Social Anxiety Disorder is the foundation. Agoraphobia is explicitly stated. PTSD is strongly suggested due to the clear history of trauma, intrusive symptoms, avoidance, and hyperarousal. Major Depressive Disorder explains her severe suicidal ideation and self-harm. Avoidant Personality Disorder, while perhaps a more speculative diagnosis due to her age, is considered due to her lifelong shyness, feelings of inadequacy, and her family dynamics. I carefully consider the appropriateness of diagnosing personality disorder in a 15-year-old and conclude that the severity and chronicity of her symptoms warrant it.\n\nFinally, I re-evaluate the F-codes to make sure I selected the most accurate match.\n\nMy final diagnoses are:\n1. Social anxiety disorder - F40.10\n2. Agoraphobia - F40.00\n3. Posttraumatic stress disorder - F43.10\n4. Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe - F32.2\n5.

    "model_thoughts":"**Expert Psychiatric Assessment and Differential Diagnosis**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. As a seasoned psychiatrist, I've meticulously reviewed the provided clinical vignette, focusing on the patient's presentation and symptoms to formulate a structured differential diagnosis.  Based on the rubric, my thought process is as follows:\n\n1.  **Anorexia Nervosa, Binge-Eating\/Purging Type (F50.02):** This is my primary diagnosis. The patient demonstrates classic restrictive behaviors (severe calorie restriction, amenorrhea) coupled with the critical element of purging through laxative use.  Even if we debate the patient's intent behind the laxative use, the frequency and context strongly suggest a purging behavior that meets the DSM-5-TR criteria. Amenorrhea, in a 16-year-old female, is a significant physiological consequence of this restriction. The exercise behaviors also align with the intense drive for thinness.\n\n2.  **Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (OSFED) - Atypical Anorexia Nervosa (F50.89):** This is a strong differential to have in the list. Without explicit weight\/BMI information, Atypical Anorexia Nervosa becomes crucial. The vignette *implies* weight loss given the amenorrhea, but in cases where the weight is within or above the normal range, the OSFED diagnosis is the better fit.\n\n3.  **Anorexia Nervosa, Restricting Type (F50.01):** We must consider this as a close differential diagnosis. If the laxative use is determined to be solely medical for constipation, not a means of purging, the restricting subtype would then be the most appropriate. But, again, given the two daily doses, in my clinical judgment, it's very likely the laxative use falls more under a purging classification.\n\n4.  **Bulimia Nervosa (F50.2):** This is a valid consideration within the differential. The purging behaviors align, and the excessive exercise often presents in these patients. However, the vignette lacks a clear description of objective binge eating, making this a secondary diagnosis in this specific case. However, given the laxative use, it can be argued this leans more towards Bulimia Nervosa, albeit with severe restriction.\n\n5.  **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (F42.2):** Finally, we include OCD in this top five. The ritualized eating behavior (slow eating over three hours) strongly suggests OCD. It's often comorbid with Eating Disorders, so this is included as a key aspect of our differential for this clinical presentation.\n\n\n",

Her husband stated that she had been behaving very strangely and that she had become convinced that she had smothered and killed her baby.\n\nHer husband reported that after a normal pregnancy and uncomplicated delivery, Ms. Norman had happily gone home with their first child. On the third day after delivery, however, her mood and affect began to shift rapidly between elation and weepiness. She became irritable and anxious. She slept only an hour a night, even when her baby was asleep. Her behavior became increasingly bizarre, with overactivity and agitation. Her speech was rapid and digressive. Although not previously a religious person, she became convinced that God was speaking through her and that she had special powers that could solve the problems of the world. She told her husband that she could identify evil people by looking into their eyes and had begun to worry that she was surrounded by evil people, including her own mother. Most disturbing for her, whenever she was out of sight of her son, she became totally convinced that she had smothered him, and no one could convince her otherwise.\n\nMs. Norman had a history of three episodes of major depressive disorder in her teens and early 20s. These episodes resolved with psychotherapy and antidepressant medication. She also had a psychiatric admission for mania 3 years prior to the delivery of her child, after a flight from Asia to Europe. Following treatment with antipsychotic medication, she became depressed for several months. Although a diagnosis of bipolar disorder was discussed at this time, she was reluctant to accept this label, attributing the episode to stress and jet lag. She had discontinued the psychiatric medication in anticipation of getting pregnant.\n\nMs. Norman\u2019s own mother had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital shortly after the birth of her first child. This episode was not talked about in the family, and there were few other details. She had no other family history of note.\n\nUntil just before delivery of her child, Ms. Norman had been a highly functional nurse in a renal unit. Her husband was the head of a sales team, and they lived in comfortable social circumstances. She had no history of illicit drug use and, prior to pregnancy, drank only 2 or 3 units of alcohol a week.\n\nOn mental status examination, Ms. Norman wandered around the room, seemingly unable to sit for more than a few moments. She was distractible and overtalkative, and demonstrated flight of ideas, flitting from one subject to another. Her mood was labile. At times she appeared happily euphoric. At other times she was tearful, and she could become quickly irritable when she felt she was not being understood. It was clear that she had a number of delusional beliefs but was unwilling to discuss most of them with the examiner. She did insist that she had already killed her own child, which led to several minutes of tears, but she returned to an edgy euphoria within a few minutes. She denied intent to harm herself or anyone else. She appeared inattentive, with poor concentration, but would not participate in formal cognitive testing.\n\nPhysical examination and laboratory testing results were all within normal limits.",

I've been given a clinical vignette about a postpartum woman, Ursula, and I'm tasked with generating a list of five psychiatric diagnoses with ICD-10 codes. I know my stuff, so I need to hit a level 5 in diagnostic reasoning. I'm going to start by pulling out all the relevant data, making mental notes as I go. Ursula is a 32-year-old nurse, brought in to the ED six days after giving birth. Her husband is reporting some pretty strange behavior, like delusions about killing the baby. The timeline is important \u2013 the pregnancy and delivery were normal, but the symptoms started just a few days ago.\n\nRight away, I'm noting the symptoms: rapid mood shifts, irritability, anxiety, euphoria, a decreased need for sleep, bizarre overactivity, agitation, and racing thoughts. She's got delusions, too \u2013 God speaking to her, special powers, paranoia, and this really specific delusion that she smothered her baby (even though it's alive). Her cognition is a bit off, like she's inattentive and won't focus for testing.\n\nNow, her psychiatric history is crucial. She's had major depressive episodes in her teens and twenties, and one manic episode three years ago that required hospitalization and antipsychotics. Bipolar was discussed back then, but she didn't accept the diagnosis. She was off meds during her pregnancy. Family history is a big red flag, too \u2013 her mother was hospitalized shortly after giving birth to her first child. Substance use is clean, which is good. The medical workup, including physical and labs, is normal. That rules out a lot of physical causes for this and keeps the focus on the psychiatric piece.\n\nHere's my diagnostic reasoning: This is a manic episode with psychotic features, starting within four weeks of delivery, making it peripartum onset. This is a clinical emergency \u2013 postpartum psychosis! My DSM-5-TR is telling me it could be Bipolar Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder with peripartum onset, or Brief Psychotic Disorder.

    "model_thoughts":"**Diagnostic Reasoning - A Deep Dive**\n\nOkay, here's how I'd approach this, as an experienced psychiatrist. My primary task is to create a list of potential diagnoses, and it demands precision. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I analyze the request, which is straightforward. The core task: Identify the likely psychiatric diagnoses, using the DSM-5-TR and ICD-10. This is the expert level.\n\nThen I extract and distill the clinical data. A 16-year-old boy with a long-standing seizure disorder presents with an acute onset of psychosis. The key association jumps out - the temporal link to the Levetiracetam. He has had a complex seizure disorder for years, controlled with Sodium Valproate, but is now acutely psychotic, agitated, and experiencing delusions after starting Levetiracetam.\n\nThe *first*, most *salient* diagnostic contender, the driver of his acute presentation, is: **Substance\/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder**.  The timing is classic, and Levetiracetam is notorious for causing this.  The DSM-5-TR makes this a clear choice when a medication is clearly the trigger.  My first instinct is to lean on *F19.959* (or F13.959) for \"Other drug-induced psychotic disorder\".\n\nHowever, I also have to consider the medical context. The patient *has* epilepsy. Is the *epilepsy* contributing to the psychosis? This becomes **Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition**.  Here, \"Forced Normalization\" - where the normalization of EEG, triggered by a drug, paradoxically induces psychosis is highly probable with Levetiracetam. Even if the Levetiracetam isn't the direct driver, the underlying seizure disorder could be at play - an ictal or post-ictal psychosis.  F06.2 is the appropriate code.  For a clear medication-related psychosis with an established organic condition like epilepsy, both the F06.2 and F19.959 codes could apply, or one might be prioritized clinically.\n\nBut here, I'm thinking, isn't the school refusal the most relevant part of this history?\n\nThe long-term avoidance is a *major* impairment. Four years of school refusal, social isolation due to the fear of seizures - that screams **Agoraphobia**. The DSM-5-TR is clear on this: if avoidance is clearly excessive, and this is excessive, it deserves its own diagnosis. I'm going with F40.00.\n\nHowever, an alternative perspective is that the fear stems directly from the seizures, which is also a cause of anxiety, and the Agoraphobia diagnosis could be refined as **Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition**.  F06.4.  This should be documented as well.\n\nThe final element I have to consider: there's *medical instability*. There was a recent Valproate toxicity and rapid drug change. Could he be **Delirious**? Given the history, the acute onset of behavioral changes and the fluctuating alertness, I'm going to include delirium as an important safety consideration to rule out. F05.\n\nSo, to summarize: Substance\/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder (F19.959 is the right code), Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (F06.2 for the epilepsy context), Agoraphobia (F40.00 is the key presentation) and the related Anxiety Disorder (F06.4), and Delirium (F05) as a safety precaution.\n\nI am now confident and ready to finalize my assessment.\n\n\n",

They describe their living situation as \"overwhelming\" due to parental boundary issues, though they maintain a supportive romantic relationship since 2019. Their psychiatric history includes diagnoses of MDD and GAD at age 15-16, PTSD in 2016 following emotional abuse by high school friends, and ADHD in 2018 (without neuropsychological evaluation). Current medications include Lisdexamfetamine 50mg (since 2018), various supplements, and a contraceptive injection. They previously tried multiple antidepressants (2011-2015) but discontinued each after approximately two weeks due to suicidal ideation and, in one case, motor disturbances. The patient consumes alcohol socially (3-5 drinks monthly) and has been vaping marijuana 1-3 times weekly for three months primarily to aid sleep and manage anxiety. The patient's primary symptoms onset around age 5 with intrusive visualizations of falling down stairs along with perfectionism through rewriting notes until they felt \"just right\". Currently, they experience significant distress when surroundings are not in the \"right spot\", spending up to 12 hours reorganizing belongings without breaks, which would cause severe distress if interrupted. This \"not just right\" feeling impairs their ability to meet deadlines, complete job applications, and fulfill social obligations. They also engage in checking behaviors when packing (counting socks repeatedly, checking for essential items) and experience distressing sexual intrusive thoughts. Additionally, the patient exhibits skin-picking behaviors, spending over an hour picking at ingrown hairs until bleeding, scratching their neck and jaw during conversations, and tearing at cuticles, with symptoms worsening during periods of anxiety. They've attempted to stop by wearing pants constantly but have been unsuccessful. The patient has a significant history of depression with three past suicide attempts (overdoses in 2014, 2015, and 2017) and self-injury through cutting (stopped in 2017). They currently experience passive suicidal ideation, anhedonia, decreased appetite, sleep difficulties, psychomotor agitation, feelings of worthlessness, and concentration problems, though they report 0% chance of self-harm in the next three months. Social anxiety manifests as persistent fear of judgment and rejection, with distressing rumination about social interactions and excessive reassurance-seeking that has cost them friendships. The patient also reported past sexual abuse by a boyfriend for 4-5 months but denied PTSD symptoms. They disclosed a history of binge eating episodes. During the binge, they ate more rapidly than normal and felt disgusted and embarrassed after. After these eating binges, pt fasted for ~3 days. These eating binges occurred <1 time per week, and the patient has not engaged in these behaviors in the past 2 months.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Diagnostic Assessment and Reasoning Process**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. We've got a complex presentation here: a 24-year-old, gender-fluid individual with a pretty hefty history. Immediately, the *Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder* (OCD) jumps out. The time-consuming rituals (reorganizing, checking), the distress, and the functional impairment (deadlines, jobs) are classic.  Then there's the *Excoriation (Skin-Picking) Disorder* \u2013 not just a habit, but a recurrent, distress-inducing behavior with attempts to stop. That's separate from the OCD, though they can often go hand-in-hand. Next, the *Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Severe* is clear \u2013 history of attempts, the current anhedonia, SI, appetite changes... it's all there, even with the stimulant use. *Social Anxiety Disorder* is another key piece. The fear of judgment and the reassurance-seeking behaviors indicate a genuine social phobia, distinct from the OCD content.\n\nNow, the fifth one is where it gets interesting, I'm between ADHD and OSFED. While ADHD is on the chart, I'm slightly hesitant given it was made \u201cwithout neuropsych\u201d and the symptoms could stem from the depression\/anxiety. However the patient is currently medicated with Lisdexamfetamine. The eating history is there (binge and purge) but it's not active currently - and sub-threshold. Given the detailed note on medication, I would still include *Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder, Combined Presentation*. We want to be thorough in our evaluation. Also, since there is the prescription of a stimulant medication, it is important to include.\n\nSo, here's my final list for this complex case. I've re-reviewed to make sure the level 5 standards are met and the best fit for the patient's current clinical picture and history is accurately reflected in these codes.\n\n1.

    "vignette":"Felicia Allen was a 32-year-old single woman brought to the emergency room (ER) by police after she apparently tried to steal a city bus in Chicago. Because she appeared to be an \u201cemotionally disturbed person,\u201d a psychiatry consultation was requested.\n\nAccording to the police report, Ms. Allen threatened the driver with a knife, took control of the almost empty city bus, and crashed it. A more complete story was elicited from a friend of Ms. Allen\u2019s who had been on the bus but who had not been arrested. According to her, they had boarded the bus on their way to a nearby shopping mall. Ms. Allen became frustrated when the driver refused her dollar bills, instead demanding exact change. She looked in her purse, but instead of finding exact change, she pulled out a kitchen knife that she carried for protection. The driver fled, so she got into the empty seat and drove the bus across the street into a nearby parked car.\n\nOn examination, Ms. Allen was a handcuffed, heavyset young woman with a bandage on her forehead. She fidgeted and rocked back and forth in her chair. She appeared to be mumbling to herself. When asked what she was saying, the patient made momentary eye contact and just repeated, \u201cSorry, sorry.\u201d She did not respond to other questions.\n\nMore information was elicited from a psychiatrist who had come to the ER soon after the accident. He said that Ms. Allen and her friend were longtime residents at the state psychiatric hospital where he worked. They had just begun to take passes every week as part of an effort toward social remediation; it had been Ms. Allen\u2019s first bus ride without a staff member.\n\nAccording to the psychiatrist, Ms. Allen had received a diagnosis of \u201cchildhood-onset, treatment-resistant paranoid schizophrenia.\u201d She had started hearing voices by age 5 years. Big, strong, intrusive, and psychotic, she had been hospitalized almost constantly since age 11. Her auditory hallucinations generally consisted of a critical voice commenting on her behavior. Her thinking was concrete, but when relaxed she could be self-reflective. She was motivated to please and recurrently said her biggest goal was to \u201chave my own room in my own house with my own friends.\u201d The psychiatrist said that he was not sure what had caused her to pull out the knife. She had not been hallucinating lately and had been feeling less paranoid, but he wondered if she had been more psychotic than she had let on. It was possible that she was just impatient and irritated. The psychiatrist also believed that she had spent almost no period of life developing normally and so had very little experience with the real world.\n\nMs. Allen had been taking clozapine for 1 year, with good resolution of her auditory hallucinations. She had gained 35 pounds on the clozapine, but she had less trouble getting out of bed in the morning and was functioning at a higher level. She was hoping to get a job and live more independently, and the bus trip had been intended as a step in that direction. Because of these improvements and goals, she had insisted on continuing to take the clozapine despite the weight gain.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Final Diagnostic Considerations**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking, as the seasoned psychiatrist in this scenario. This patient, Felicia Allen, presents a complex clinical picture that demands a nuanced diagnostic approach. My primary responsibility is to distill all available information into a concise, clinically accurate diagnosis, using DSM-5-TR criteria and ICD-10 codes.\n\nThe key to unlocking this case lies in acknowledging the overlap between developmental and psychotic disorders, something often missed. I'm seeing a core diagnosis of **Schizophrenia (F20.9)**, which is consistent with the patient's long-term history of hallucinations, treatment resistance, and chronic hospitalization. However, the \"childhood onset\" adds significant complexity, leading me to seriously consider neurodevelopmental factors.\n\nThe presentation in the ER - the rocking, muttering, and apparent lack of responsiveness - screams **Catatonia Associated with Another Mental Disorder (F06.1)**. This seems to be an acute reaction, and I'll need to rule out other medical conditions. But it's clear and clinically important, so it earns a place in the top five.\n\nThe \"concrete thinking\" and \"almost no period of normal development\" from the history suggests **Unspecified Intellectual Disability (F79)**. It's tough to nail down the precise severity without testing, but the deficits are significant. This is a crucial piece of the puzzle, explaining the behavioral disinhibition and impulse issues.\n\nAlso, I'm finding strong evidence of **Autism Spectrum Disorder (F84.0)**. The early onset of psychosis, the social deficits, the stereotyped behaviors (rocking), and the \"concrete thinking\" all point to ASD. It is a common misdiagnosis in cases of childhood-onset psychosis and one that needs to be brought up.\n\nFinally, while the behavior could be a psychotic symptom, the act of attempting to steal a bus, coupled with the psychiatrist's doubts about active psychosis, raises the specter of an **Unspecified Impulse-Control Disorder (F63.9)**. This is the behavior that landed her here. The knife wielding is clearly dysregulated behavior that requires a code. It fits the presentation.\n\nSo, summing it up, my five diagnostic impressions are: Schizophrenia (F20.9), Catatonia Associated with Another Mental Disorder (F06.1), Unspecified Intellectual Disability (F79), Autism Spectrum Disorder (F84.0), and Unspecified Impulse-Control Disorder (F63.9). These five are both comprehensive and defensible. I'm ready to move forward.\n\n\n",

    "model_thoughts":"**My mental process in reviewing this clinical vignette and formulating the top five diagnoses and corresponding ICD-10 F-codes has followed a rigorous, multi-layered approach.**\n\nFirst, I extracted key data points, meticulously noting age-related developmental milestones, presenting symptoms, and relevant medical history to understand Melanie's unique profile. The chief complaint of racial slurs, while concerning, needed contextualization within her broader clinical presentation. I carefully considered her developmental history, particularly the delayed speech and social difficulties, recognizing their potential implications. I also meticulously documented ASD and tic symptoms (including their evolution and phenomenology), noting their onset and duration, differentiating between involuntary tics and intentional behaviors. The absence of certain symptoms (e.g., mood disorders, OCD, hallucinations) was also crucial in narrowing the differential.\n\nNext, I engaged in diagnostic reasoning, systematically applying DSM-5-TR criteria and the ICD-10 coding system. I approached this like a puzzle. Autism Spectrum Disorder (F84.0) was immediately apparent given the persistent social communication deficits, restricted interests, and repetitive behaviors originating in early childhood. Tourette's Disorder (F95.2) emerged as a second clear diagnosis, supported by multiple motor tics and a vocal tic (coprolalia) lasting over a year.\n\nMy third diagnosis was nuanced. While the initial presentation raised a concern for Stereotypic Movement Disorder (F98.4) given the self-injurious behavior (head slapping), I meticulously evaluated this within the context of her tics, noting the premonitory urge (\"I have to do it\") and the progression of symptoms. I concluded it was likely a complex motor tic associated with Tourette's, ruling out a separate diagnosis.\n\nThe significant speech delay, first word at 48 months, prompted further examination. Although this symptom may fit in ASD, I considered Intellectual Disability and Language Disorder, ultimately recognizing the need for separate diagnostic consideration. I considered the history of language delay and the possibility of concurrent cognitive impairment that may not be fully evaluated and coded her as \"Unspecified Intellectual Disability\" or \"Global Developmental Delay\", or *Language Disorder (F80.2\/F80.9)* given that the presenting symptoms suggested a communication disorder.\n\nThe clinical data of \"rocking when anxious\" and \"meltdown\" (inflexibility and behavioral dysregulation) led me to consider an Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9). I considered other differentials (e.g. ADHD, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder). However, I felt these were weaker in comparison to ID (in this case) and Anxiety (more applicable).\n\nIn final review, my mental process led to prioritizing the presenting condition, but also the underlying disorder(s) and their comorbidities and impacts.\n\nMy final diagnoses are:\n\n1.  Autism spectrum disorder - F84.0\n2.  Tourette\u2019s disorder - F95.2\n3.  Unspecified intellectual disability - F79\n4.  Language disorder - F80.9\n5.  Unspecified anxiety disorder - F41.9\n\n\n",

He reported having gone to several operas and taken singing classes to impress her, even though he did not particularly enjoy music. That relationship had recently ended for unclear reasons.

    "model_thoughts":"**My Diagnostic Reasoning Process for Nate Irvin**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a vignette about a 31-year-old patient named Nate Irvin, and my task is to come up with the most accurate psychiatric diagnoses based on the information provided. I'm a seasoned psychiatrist, so I'm going to follow my training and use the DSM-5-TR criteria and ACGME Psychiatry Milestones to ensure a comprehensive and defensible assessment. The treating psychiatrist in the vignette tried to misdiagnose him; I won't.\n\nFirst, I meticulously went through the patient's presentation. He's described as having \"lack of self-confidence\" and feeling \"stuck\" in his job, which is giving me pause. His history reveals lifelong difficulty with assertiveness and a tendency to \"go with the flow,\" even at the expense of his own preferences. He has trouble making independent decisions and, according to the vignette, he'd rather be told what to do to avoid the \"burden\" of decision-making. That's a huge red flag. His relationships are also interesting; he adapts to his partners' preferences, and the information suggests he fears being alone.\n\nThe most concerning thing to me is the fact that he's been taking Alprazolam daily, and has been \"doctor shopping\" to obtain it, from multiple physicians, a practice that's often a signal of a deepening problem. This raises all kinds of red flags that must be carefully considered. It appears he's developed tolerance and experiences withdrawal symptoms when he attempts to cut back. This information seems more significant than the vignette's psychiatrist gave it credit.\n\nThe patient denies SIGECAPS symptoms of depression, but he does describe sadness and crying spells following a recent breakup. His use of a medication for anxiety suggests some anxiety issues, and it's important to differentiate any GAD from the symptoms of the personality disorder. I'm going to have to decide if his \"anxiety\" is a standalone disorder, related to the personality, or just substance-induced.\n\nBased on the information, I'm already zeroing in on a few key diagnostic possibilities. His difficulty making decisions, the need for reassurance, and his fear of being alone strongly suggest **Dependent Personality Disorder**. The substance use history (doctor shopping and withdrawal) points to a **Benzodiazepine Use Disorder**, which should be at the top of the list. His sadness following the breakup, which doesn't quite meet the criteria for Major Depressive Disorder, probably indicates an **Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood**. The vignette says he was originally prescribed it for anxiety, but it could be **Generalized Anxiety Disorder** or **Substance-Induced Anxiety Disorder.**\n\nSo here's what I've come up with. I'm going to start with **Dependent Personality Disorder** as the primary diagnosis. This best explains the patient's lifelong pattern of behavior and his interpersonal difficulties. Second, given the serious and dangerous doctor shopping, I'm strongly considering **Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder**. It is critical to take this seriously, since there's evidence of tolerance and withdrawal. Next, I'm listing **Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood**, given the recent onset of depressive symptoms after the breakup. Fourth, I'm including **Generalized Anxiety Disorder** as a strong differential given the patient's history. Finally, I'll list **Avoidant Personality Disorder** on my differential, though he does actively seek relationships.\n\nAfter double checking everything and reviewing the data, I'm confident in these diagnoses.\n\n\n",

    "model_thoughts":"**Diagnosis: The Mind's Tapestry**\n\nOkay, here's how I'd approach this case, step-by-step, the way my mind works when I'm assessing a complex psychiatric presentation. First, I'm taking in the raw data, like a mental checklist. We have a 37-year-old male with a history of hypertension, substance use (meth, marijuana), and psychotic symptoms, plus a history with antipsychotics but no adherence. He's brought in by police, showing acute aggression, delusions (\"devil\", \"god\"), agitation, and he's Tased, needing IM meds (Haldol, Ativan, Benadryl) to get control. His urine is positive for marijuana, meth, and PCP. Now, the timeline is crucial: the acute symptoms resolve within 24 hours. He denies delusions later, and there's amnesia for the gas station incident. He admits to a 2-day binge of marijuana, meth, and PCP. He is homeless.\n\nThe key here, for me, is the *context* of substance use and the rapid resolution. That's a red flag for a substance-induced etiology, even with that history of psychosis. I'm immediately thinking PCP, given the \"God-like\" delusions, aggression, amnesia, and tasing needed, but meth is definitely on my radar due to the paranoia and agitation.\n\nOkay, so diagnosis number one is a *Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder*. Which one? Well, both meth and PCP are in play, but given the specific symptom constellation, PCP is the dominant factor in this scenario. Remember, the DSM usually needs the substance specified. The fact that the amnesia and grandiose delusion points very very strongly to PCP, in the setting of positive UDS.\n\nBut now, I'm stepping back. He admits to the binge, has a substance use history, and is homeless. That's a *severe* substance use disorder. So, number two is a *Phencyclidine Use Disorder* (Severe), and number three, *Stimulant Use Disorder* (Amphetamine-Type, Severe). Cannabis is also positive, but he's already presented with two primary and clinically concerning substances, so Cannabis Use Disorder comes as number five, and it is a comorbid diagnosis.\n\nNow, that history of \"psychosis\" and antipsychotics... that's a wild card. I can't ignore it. Even though this *episode* is clearly substance-induced, there might be a primary psychotic disorder lurking there. He has psychosis, on antipsychotics, currently. And we don't have enough information in this vignette to rule it out. So, number four is *Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder*. It's a bit of a \"history-based\" diagnosis, but a history has consequences for treatment, and he likely has an undiagnosed schizophrenia spectrum disorder.\n\nIn the end, even if this acute episode is drug-induced, and the symptoms resolved upon abstinence, we need to take that past psychotic history into account.

    "vignette":"A 39-year-old Caucasian male presented to inpatient psychiatry after initially presenting to the emergency department with psychosis. He had been found crawling in a parking lot with several feet of intestines dragging on the ground. The patient was only responding internally during the examination, and a urine drug screen was positive only for cannabis. He received an emergent exploratory laparotomy with a partial colectomy. He stabilized medically but became briefly catatonic on day six of hospitalization, which was resolved with intravenous diazepam. On day seven, he was transferred to the inpatient psychiatry unit on a voluntary basis.\n\nOn admission to inpatient psychiatry, the patient was fully oriented and able to recall stabbing himself in the abdomen because characters in his mind told him to, having an out-of-body experience as he watched himself pull out several feet of intestines. He felt compelled to follow the voices' commands because he had guilt about his history of sexual abuse towards women. He then recalls running out of his apartment and waking up in the hospital. He endorsed paranoia and auditory hallucinations for the last 10 years but never sought treatment. He felt hopeless, yet believed his potential was infinite. He had no suicidal ideation and expressed a fear of hurting himself upon returning home if the voices persisted.\n\nHe had never been diagnosed with a psychiatric illness or received treatment, but he did see a psychiatrist at age 17 after he was charged with indecent exposure. He recalled periods in his life when he had little need for sleep, had racing thoughts, and felt that signs and advertisements were speaking directly to him. His social history was notable for heavy cannabis use beginning at age 18. He was a daily user for 5-6 years and began experiencing paranoia and auditory hallucinations. Despite quitting for two years, the psychotic symptoms persisted, and he reported currently using cannabis 3-4 days per week. He also had a history of trauma and was emotionally and physically abused by his father who had alcohol use disorder.\n\nOn a physical exam, the patient had normal speech and appearance, an expansive affect, and poor insight. He endorsed auditory hallucinations of male voices that were commanding and feelings of paranoia.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Here's how I'm thinking about this clinical case, step-by-step:**\n\nFirst, I'm taking in all the raw data: the patient's age, presentation (self-inflicted injuries, a serious red flag), the acute course, and then all the current symptoms \u2013 command hallucinations, guilt-ridden delusions, paranoia, and the curious mix of hopelessness and grandiosity. It's a lot to process. I'm also noting the patient's long history \u2013 10 years of paranoia and auditory hallucinations \u2013 and the manic-like symptoms reported. Substance use is a big piece of the puzzle, especially the details about how the psychosis persisted despite a period of abstinence. And I'm not forgetting the social and forensic history, which adds another layer of complexity.\n\nNow, I'm organizing this information in my mental scratchpad. I'm noting key features that will inform my differential: the chronic nature of the psychosis, the manic-like symptoms (racing thoughts, little sleep, expansive affect), and the substance use history.\n\nNext, I'm jumping into diagnostic reasoning with a Level 5 approach. Immediately, I'm considering Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar I Disorder with Psychotic Features, and Schizophrenia as the top contenders. I see the chronic psychosis and the manic features. But, to me, the best fit is **Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type** because it captures the chronic psychosis *and* the manic symptoms. The fact that the psychosis has persisted for 10 years and the vignette states \"periods\" of mania strongly supports the diagnosis. The 2-week rule is likely met with the constant hallucinations and paranoia.\n\nThen, there's the **Cannabis Use Disorder**, which is clearly present. Heavy, daily use and a positive drug screen solidify this diagnosis. Even if the psychosis isn't *caused* by the cannabis, the substance use disorder itself is significant.\n\nThe acute episode of **Catatonia** is also a key factor.  This also gets its own code.\n\nI am also considering the main differentials: **Schizophrenia** is next most likely if the mood symptoms are considered less prominent. And, **Bipolar I Disorder, Current or Most Recent Episode Manic, With Psychotic Features**, is next if the psychosis is strictly linked to mood episodes.\n\nI'm aware of the PTSD history and the history of sexual abuse towards women, but I'm focusing on the primary psychotic\/mood presentation, at this point.\n\nThe prompt now asks for ICD-10 codes, so I need to translate these diagnoses into the appropriate codes:\n1.  **Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type** - **F25.0**\n2.  **Cannabis use disorder, severe** - **F12.20**\n3.  **Catatonia associated with another mental disorder** - **F06.1**\n4.  **Schizophrenia** - **F20.9**\n5.  **Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe, with psychotic features** - **F31.2**\n\nI\u2019ve double-checked these ICD-10 codes in the DSM-5-TR to be as accurate as possible.\n\n\n",

    "model_thoughts":"**Diagnosis Derivation: An Expert's Perspective**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. My initial assessment screams **Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD - F91.3)**.  The vignette is practically a textbook presentation:  argumentative, defiant, and that vindictive streak (intentional messes? Absolutely). The chronic nature, with issues at school and home, seals the deal.\n\nHowever, I can't ignore the more severe behaviors. The profanities and the desk-kicking are concerning, so **Conduct Disorder (F91.2 - Adolescent-onset)** is a strong contender, or possibly unspecified if the exact age of onset is unclear, or the severity doesn't quite reach the full criteria. While ODD is a better fit for the primary presentation, the potential escalation warrants consideration, especially if those behaviors are escalating, like if he starts intentionally damaging the school property.\n\nNext, ADHD. This kid's impulsivity (desk-kicking, interrupting, profanities), combined with potential inattention leading to academic struggles, makes **Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder, Combined Presentation (F90.2)** a definite possibility, or a likely comorbidity.  Ruling this out is crucial to ensure we're not missing a key piece of the puzzle.\n\nNow, that chronic irritability and the outbursts... are we seeing signs of **Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (F34.81)**? The mocking, the angry \"rolling eyes\", and the lack of a clear \"normal\" mood in between outbursts make this a relevant diagnostic differential, though more data is needed to confirm the pervasiveness of the irritability.\n\nFinally, we must consider the environmental factors. The \"my mom\" comment suggests some familial stress, so an **Adjustment Disorder with Disturbance of Conduct (F43.24)** is a possibility. Maybe his behavior is a reaction to a specific stressor, though the pervasive nature of his symptoms makes ODD\/CD more likely. However, this is important to keep in mind given the relational problems.\n\nIn conclusion, I'd say those are the top possibilities in order of likelihood, given this particular vignette.\n\n\n",

    "model_thoughts":"**Initial Assessment and Diagnostic Formulation**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. I'm presented with a 15-year-old male, and my role is to formulate a diagnosis based on the information provided, adhering to the DSM-5-TR. I'm focusing on Level 5 reasoning, which means I need to be thorough and consider all possibilities while only using the facts given.\n\nFirstly, I'm analyzing the request. My key constraints are that I should act as a psychiatrist, base my judgment only on the data in front of me, stick to DSM-5-TR, and provide an ICD-10 F-code list. So, no speculating beyond what's written.\n\nNow, let's break down the information, starting with the patient's demographics: A 15-year-old male who has just been discharged from an inpatient stay after assaulting a peer. His affect is irritable, and his responses are one-word answers, with poor eye contact.\n\nHis history is revealing: Chronic irritability and frequent angry outbursts. There's a history of academic struggles, repeating 4th grade, with a recent decline. Behaviors include slamming doors, fighting at school, and arguing with authority, notably with the principal. Socially, he's isolated, has no friends, and was kicked off the basketball team for arguing. Developmentally, his milestones were met. No history of trauma or abuse, and he lives with his biological mother and stepfather. An interesting nuance is his deep caretaking role for three dogs and two cats. He adopted all of them, and this is a key factor. There are no mentions of hallucinations, delusions, or substance use.\n\nNow the hard part: The diagnosis. Given the chronic irritability and anger, I'm strongly leaning toward **Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD)**. This fits the pattern: severe temper outbursts, inconsistency with developmental level, and a persistently irritable\/angry mood. His age also falls into the 6-18 window for diagnosis. Could it be Bipolar Disorder? No, there is no mania, and the irritability is chronic, not episodic. Could it be Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD)? Yes, he argues, but if DMDD criteria are met, DMDD wins. Given the severity (hospitalization for assault), DMDD seems a better fit than ODD, even if the frequency is not entirely certain.\n\nMoving on, the aggression (fighting, assault) makes me consider **Conduct Disorder (CD)**. However, the care he shows toward his pets creates a significant point of concern for CD. CD commonly includes cruelty toward animals, and this directly opposes that. While he has been aggressive, it seems reactive (due to the irritability) rather than purely predatory. Could it be **Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED)**? Perhaps, but DMDD excludes IED.\n\nNext, I'm analyzing social deficits: No friends, isolation, poor eye contact, and the \"justification\" with the principal. These point me to **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)**. The social isolation, poor eye contact, difficulty with peers, and potential rigid thinking seem to fit.\n\nThen, there are the academic issues. Academic struggles, repeating a grade, and recent decline? **Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)** seems highly likely. The impulsivity of fights could also be part of the diagnosis. ADHD and DMDD are very common co-morbid diagnoses.\n\nLastly, mood. The chronic irritability is likely to be a mood disorder, and the academic decline and isolation make me think of **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)** or **Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)**. In adolescents, depression often looks like irritability. DMDD also fits as a depressive disorder and should also be considered.\n\nSo, here's my top 5 most probable diagnoses:\n\n1.  **Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (F34.81)**: The core issue, fits the pervasive irritability and aggression.\n2.  **Autism Spectrum Disorder (F84.0)**: Supports social deficits and rigidity.\n3.  **Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder, Combined presentation (F90.2)**: Explains the academic struggles and impulsivity.\n4.  **Conduct Disorder, Childhood-onset type (F91.1)**: Essential to address the assault history, even with the empathy for animals.\n5.  **Specific Learning Disorder, Unspecified (F81.9)**: Accounts for the repeated grade and academic struggles.\n\n**Final Consideration**\n\nNow, I'm running final code checks and making sure these are the best diagnostic matches, considering the rubric.\n\nThe ICD-10 codes are: F34.81 for DMDD, F84.0 for ASD, F90.2 for ADHD\n\n",

While Mr. Young sat quietly beside her, she reported that a change had come over him during the last 6 months. He was either quiet and withdrawn or uncharacteristically irritable. He had begun to drink alcohol to excess in social situations, sometimes embarrassing her. He often came home late, or not at all, claiming to have been at the office. When away from home, he rarely answered phone calls and text messages. She wondered if he was having an affair. Mr. Young denied seeing anyone else and indicated he had just been having a hard time.\n\nAfter his wife left the psychiatrist\u2019s office, Mr. Young reported a great deal of stress at work over the last year as he tried to deal with industry-wide setbacks and personal financial losses. He said he felt down and depressed most of the time. He reported difficulty sleeping most nights, loss of interest in his wife and children, low energy, and feelings of failure and self-criticism. He had frequent thoughts of wanting to be dead and of suicide, but he denied any suicidal intent or plans.\n\nWhen asked about the alcohol, he acknowledged that he had been drinking heavily for at least 6 months. When asked about other substances, he asked about therapeutic confidentiality and then acknowledged that he had been using cocaine several times per week for about 9 months. He kept his cocaine use from his wife because he knew she would be judgmental. In the beginning, cocaine put him in a reliably positive, optimistic mood, and he found that he could more successfully churn through large volumes of otherwise tedious and discouraging work. Although his work required some socializing in the evening, he also began to regularly go to bars in the evening just so that he would have a place to comfortably combine cocaine with alcohol. He craved the high from cocaine, went out of his way to obtain it, and spent a lot of time getting high that he would previously have been spending with his family.\n\nWhen asked to clarify the sequence of work stress, cocaine use, and depression symptoms, he reported that he had felt worried and discouraged about work for a year, but the feelings of depression, loss of interest, irritability, insomnia, and low self-esteem had not begun until about 6 months earlier, 3 months after he had begun to use cocaine regularly. He experienced those depressive symptoms most of the day every day, whether or not he had taken cocaine within the last several days.\n\nMr. Young denied any previous episodes of depression, other mood or anxiety disorders, or suicide attempts. He drank socially. He had experimented with cannabis and cocaine as a teenager but had never developed a pattern of regular use or impairment until the past year.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Internal Diagnostic Process: Expert Psychiatrist Perspective**\n\nOkay, here's my thought process on this \"Frank Young\" case. First, I analyzed the request and made sure I understood the constraints: sticking to the DSM-5-TR, providing only diagnoses, and following the rubric for data extraction and reasoning. No problem; I can work with that.\n\nNext, I jumped into my simulated \"Level 5\" data extraction mode. I meticulously noted the key facts: the 40-year-old male, the changes observed by his wife, and Frank's detailed history. I built a timeline: work stress, then cocaine use, then depression (interestingly, it started *after* cocaine). I also noted the alcohol use and lack of prior psychiatric history. This timeline is critical, so I'm paying close attention to it. I'm focusing on the depressive symptoms and if they persist despite not using, as well.\n\nThe diagnostic reasoning started to take shape. The depression definitely fits a Major Depressive Episode, but the big question: MDD or Substance\/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder? Based on the criteria, the temporal relationship is key. The depression following cocaine use so closely is a HUGE red flag. I'm leaning heavily toward \"Cocaine-Induced Depressive Disorder\" because of that. The DSM-5-TR stresses that if symptoms start during substance use or withdrawal, and there's no strong history of independent episodes, the induced diagnosis is favored. Frank has no such history.\n\nI considered all the possibilities and how the data aligns with them. I'm thinking: is it possible that this is really MDD and the cocaine is self-medication? Maybe, but given how Frank went from using cocaine to feeling good to feeling horrible, I'm thinking the dopamine depletion from chronic use is the most likely cause.\n\nSo, I'm getting a list of diagnoses sorted out. First, *Cocaine-Induced Depressive Disorder*. But that leads me to think more generally: He meets diagnostic criteria for *Stimulant Use Disorder*. I'm also thinking of *Alcohol Use Disorder*. Then there's the MDD *differential*. I also need to note the adjustment disorder. And *could* the alcohol be causing the depression? Maybe, but cocaine looks to be the clearer factor.\n\nI'm thinking more about how to put these diagnoses into the required format. I'm making sure I'm using the right ICD-10 codes. Okay, I've got it. DSM-5 wants the *name* of the diagnosis and then the ICD-10 code. Now the question is the *order*. The induced disorder can be listed first because that is what brought him to the wife's concern. But the use disorder is at the *core* of the situation. I want to emphasize the fact that the use disorder led to the other symptoms.\n\nLet me think this through. DSM-5 separates the substance use disorder from the induced disorder. However, ICD-10 usually links them together (F14.24, for example). This means that listing them as separate might seem redundant. Hmm... this feels like a judgement call. I feel the urge to document all the nuances to make my reasoning clear. So let's re-evaluate. I need to list both, but not have redundant coding. Let me re-check the DSM diagnostic criteria. This is where I start thinking to myself \"Okay, if I do X, it covers Y, but...\".\n\nMy concern: If I use \"Cocaine-induced depressive disorder\" (F14.24), does it also cover the stimulant use? The diagnosis and coding are related, but do I need to be more explicit for clinical reasons? Should I say \"Stimulant Use Disorder\" separately? I will prioritize clarity and specificity, even if it leads to two diagnoses with the same F code.\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I'm circling around three things. Cocaine-Induced Depressive Disorder. Alcohol Use Disorder. And the Major Depressive Disorder (as a differential; the \"what if it's not the cocaine?\" issue). The adjustment disorder is also important here.\n\nSo, the adjustment disorder? Frank was worried about work and financial issues (that goes back a year before the drugs), but the onset of the depressive symptoms was after the cocaine. Should I say \"Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood\" or \"Unspecified Anxiety Disorder\"? The adjustment disorder might actually cover those initial stressors but I don't feel sure if the full criteria are met. I'll make a point to list the differential if the MDE turns out to *not* be substance-induced.\n\nAnd now I'm starting to worry: Is it even *correct* to diagnose a use disorder *and* an induced disorder? The code links them. DSM-5 wants the diagnoses separate. What is best for the clinical picture and\n\n",

As the patient entered the clinic waiting room, he announced, \u201cGod has cured me! I can stop my antivirals!\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. Lopez fidgeted on a chair, furiously writing on a yellow pad, his partner provided the recent history. He said that the patient had been doing well until approximately 1 month earlier. At that point, he began an unusually intense editing project. After about 10 days of little sleep, \u201cboundless energy,\u201d and activity, Mr. Lopez seemed edgy, a little pressured, and \u201cglassy-eyed.\u201d That night, the two of them went to a party to celebrate the completion of the work project. Despite several years of Narcotics Anonymous meetings and abstinence from illicit substances, Mr. Lopez took crystal methamphetamine, a stimulant. Acutely anxious and paranoid that they were being followed, Mr. Lopez drank three martinis but still did not sleep that night. Over the ensuing days the patient became less paranoid, but he appeared increasingly distracted and his speech was more pressured.\n\nMr. Lopez\u2019s work project was returned with multiple negative comments and requests for corrections. Instead of focusing on his editing, however, he stayed up late every night, intent on finding a cure for HIV. He made inappropriate, hypersexual advances toward other men at the gym, where he spent much of the day. He lost at least 5 pounds after deciding he should take vitamin supplements instead of food and his antiretroviral medication. He refused to go to the emergency room but finally agreed to come to his routine AIDS clinic appointment to show his doctors how well he had done despite not having taken his medications in over a month.\n\nMr. Lopez\u2019s psychiatric history was without a prior episode of clear-cut mania, but he had been depressed as a teenager during the early phase of his coming-out process. That episode was punctuated by a purposeful overdose and a 2-week psychiatric hospitalization and treatment with antidepressant medication and psychotherapy. Mr. Lopez had discontinued the medication because it made him \u201chyper and edgy,\u201d and he stopped the psychotherapy because \u201cit was pointless.\u201d He used methamphetamine frequently for several years, which led to recurrent unprotected intercourse with strangers.\n\nMr. Lopez was diagnosed with HIV at age 22, at which point he went to an outpatient substance use disorder rehabilitation center and discontinued his use of stimulants and alcohol. His lowest CD4 lymphocyte count had been 216 cells\/mm3, when he was age 24, at which time his viral load was 1.6 million copies. He had been reportedly adherent to his antiretroviral medications since then. His most recent CD4 count, 6 months prior to this episode, had been 526 cells\/mm3. His viral load had been undetectable. He had suffered fatigue but had not had any AIDS-defining illnesses. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain revealed mild cortical atrophy and periventricular white matter disease in excess of what would be expected for his age. The partner was unsure when Mr. Lopez had discontinued his antiretrovirals but thought it might have been months earlier. He also wondered if Mr. Lopez had \u201clost a step\u201d cognitively over the past year.\n\nHis family psychiatric history was significant for a maternal aunt who had received lithium and several courses of electroconvulsive therapy, but her diagnosis was unknown.\n\nOn examination, the patient was a sloppily dressed young man who told a pressured, disjointed story of events over the prior month. He was difficult to direct and was uncharacteristically irritable and devaluing. He was preoccupied with having discovered a cure for HIV through multivitamins and exercise. He denied hallucinations and suicidal and homicidal ideation. He refused cognitive testing, and his insight and judgment appeared poor.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Diagnostic Reasoning: A Deep Dive into Sebastian Lopez's Case**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm thinking through this complex presentation. First, I need to wear my expert hat and meticulously analyze this vignette. The task is clear: diagnose Sebastian, a 27-year-old Hispanic male, using DSM-5-TR, with a particular focus on the diagnostic process, not just the output. I'm aiming for Level 5 performance here, which means a comprehensive and nuanced analysis.\n\nThe starting point is Sebastian's chief complaint: \"God has cured me!\" This immediately raises a red flag, suggesting a possible psychotic component, which is coupled with a cessation of antiviral medication, a clear risk to his health. My first task is the careful extraction and organization of all available clinical data. I'm focusing on the timeline here. He has a history of teenage depression and substance use, which is critical. The \"glassy-eyed,\" boundless energy, and little sleep *before* the drug use is a huge clue. This precedes the party where he took crystal meth, supporting a possible diagnosis of mania with substance use as a precipitant or exacerbating factor. Then there is his prior medication reaction, as \"Hyper and Edgy\" (reaction to antidepressants). A family history of Lithium use (Maternal Aunt) is another strong marker.\n\nNext, I'm digging into Sebastian's psychiatric and medical history. He's HIV-positive, and the MRI shows some concerning cortical atrophy and white matter disease. He has a history of meth use.  His partner reports cognitive decline.\n\nNow, the diagnostic reasoning. The primary consideration is *Bipolar I Disorder*. The current manic episode fits the criteria, with grandiosity, decreased sleep, pressured speech, and impulsivity. The history of depression, and, the family history are supporting details. Despite substance use, the temporal relationship and the nature of the prodrome (a clear period of mania *before* the substance use) suggests primary Bipolar Disorder.\n\nI have to carefully evaluate the *Substance\/Medication-Induced Bipolar and Related Disorder* hypothesis. The mania predated the substance, so it's not the primary cause. This is important to rule out that the drug is the sole cause. Substance is a *factor*, but not primary.\n\nA critical point is the possible *Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to HIV Infection*. The partner's observations, the MRI, and some functional decline, warrant this, possibly Mild NCD, given the context.\n\nI am also considering *Substance Use Disorders*. Stimulant use disorder is clear, with a history and relapse. Alcohol comes up too.\n\nFinally, I think the \"Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions (HIV)\" are vital. His delusion is directly impacting his adherence to HIV treatment, which is critical.\n\nI am now focusing my refined list.\n\n1.  **Bipolar I Disorder, Current Episode Manic, With Psychotic Features** - This is the primary diagnosis based on the clinical presentation and history.\n2.  **Stimulant Use Disorder, Amphetamine-type** - A critical secondary factor, particularly the recent relapse.\n3.  **Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to HIV Infection** - Given the MRI findings and cognitive complaints, this is also crucial.\n4.  **Alcohol Use Disorder** - Due to the rehab history, despite a recent slip.\n5.  **Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions** - Given his refusal of medications, due to mania and delusion.\n\nI double-check all these codes. And, finally, I'm convinced that the reasoning is sound and the diagnoses are appropriate.\n\n\n",
