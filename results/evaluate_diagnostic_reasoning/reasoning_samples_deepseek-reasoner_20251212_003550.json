    "vignette":"Terry Najarian, a 65-year-old salesman for a large corporation, presented for a psychiatric evaluation after his wife threatened to leave him. Although he said he was embarrassed to discuss his issues with a stranger, he described his sexual interest in women\u2019s undergarments in a quite matter-of-fact manner. This interest had surfaced several years earlier and had not been a problem until he was caught masturbating by his wife 6 weeks prior to the evaluation. Upon seeing him dressed in panties and a bra, she initially \u201cwent nuts,\u201d thinking he was having an affair. After he clarified that he was not seeing anyone else, she \u201cshut him out\u201d and hardly spoke to him. When they argued, she called him a \u201cpervert\u201d and made it clear that she was considering divorce unless he \u201cgot help.\u201d\n\nMr. Najarian\u2019s habit began in the setting of his wife\u2019s severe arthritis and likely depression, both of which significantly reduced her overall activity level and specifically her interest in sex. His \u201cfetish\u201d was the bright spot during his frequent and otherwise dreary business trips. He also masturbated at home but generally waited until his wife was out of the house. His specific pattern was to masturbate about twice weekly, using bras and panties that he had collected over several years. He said that intercourse with his wife had faded to \u201cevery month or two\u201d but was mutually satisfying.\n\nThe patient had been married for over 30 years, and the couple had two grown children. Mr. Najarian had planned to retire comfortably later that year, but not if the two choices were either \u201cto be poor after we split the assets or to sit around the house all day and be called a pervert.\u201d\n\nHe became visibly anxious when discussing his marital difficulties. He described some recent difficulty falling asleep and \u201cworried constantly\u201d about his marriage but denied other psychiatric problems. He had made a show of throwing away a half dozen pieces of underwear, which had seemed to reassure his wife, but he had saved his \u201cfavorites\u201d and \u201ccould always buy more.\u201d He said he was of mixed mind. He did not want to end his marriage, but he saw nothing harmful in his new mode of masturbating. \u201cI\u2019m not unfaithful or doing anything bad,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just excites me, and my wife certainly doesn\u2019t want to be having sex a few times a week.\u201d\n\nMr. Najarian denied any difficulties related to sexual functioning, adding that he could maintain erections and achieve orgasm without women\u2019s undergarments. He recalled being aroused when he touched women\u2019s underwear as a teenager and had masturbated repeatedly to that experience. That fantasy had disappeared when he became sexually active with his wife. He denied any personal or family history of mental illness.",

    "model_thoughts":"Hmm, this is a complex clinical vignette requiring careful diagnostic reasoning. The patient presents with a paraphilic interest in women's undergarments that causes interpersonal distress but no self-reported distress. Need to prioritize DSM-5-TR criteria while considering the nuanced presentation.\n\nThe primary issue appears to be a paraphilic disorder, specifically fetishistic disorder. Key criteria are met: recurrent intense sexual arousal from nonliving objects (underwear) for over 6 months, acting on urges with masturbation, and causing clinically significant distress in marriage. Though the patient doesn't feel distressed, the marital conflict qualifies as interpersonal distress under DSM-5.\n\nSecondary considerations include adjustment disorder due to acute stress reactions about the marriage, and possible other sexual dysfunctions despite his denials. The wife's depression mentioned could be relevant but isn't directly part of the patient's diagnosis. GAD seems less likely as anxiety appears situational rather than generalized.\n\nImportant to note the patient's lack of personal distress - this distinguishes it from ego-dystonic presentations. The fetishistic behavior is longstanding but only became problematic when discovered, suggesting the disorder was present but previously uncompensated.",

    "vignette":"A 27-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of convulsions.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 2 years before this admission, when shaking of the trunk, arms, and legs occurred. The episode lasted approximately 4 to 5 minutes and had been preceded by a sharp pain in the back of the head that radiated to the neck, blurred vision, palpitations, nausea, and difficulty concentrating. The patient did not seek evaluation, and no additional convulsive episodes occurred during the subsequent 20 months.\nFour months before this admission, while the patient was drinking alcohol at a party, his body suddenly became stiff, and he fell backward onto a table. Shaking of the trunk, arms, and legs occurred for approximately 5 to 8 minutes. He had urinary incontinence but did not bite his tongue. Five minutes later, similar convulsions occurred. The patient was taken to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. The results of computed tomography of the head were normal, as was an electroencephalogram (EEG) that was obtained over a period of 40 minutes. Treatment with levetiracetam was started. The patient was discharged home with a recommendation for follow-up evaluation at the neurology clinic of the other hospital.\nThree months before this admission, the patient was evaluated at the neurology clinic of the other hospital. He reported that despite the use of levetiracetam, convulsions occurred approximately once per week. The results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, were reportedly normal. Treatment with lamotrigine was started. There was no change in the quality or frequency of the convulsive episodes.\nOne month before this admission, while the patient was at work, his colleagues found him on the floor, and they witnessed \u201cshaking and clenching\u201d movements of the trunk, arms, and legs that lasted approximately 2 minutes. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was taken to the emergency department of a second hospital for evaluation.\nAt least two additional convulsive episodes occurred at the second hospital. During one episode, the shaking movements became less intense when the physician\u2019s hand was placed on the patient\u2019s shoulder; the movements resumed at the previous intensity when the hand was removed. In addition, the patient\u2019s eyes were closed. When the eyelids were opened manually, no nystagmus or gaze deviation was present. When the eyelids were released, the eyes shut forcefully and Bell\u2019s phenomenon (upward deviation of the eyes when closing) occurred. The patient did not speak but was able to follow simple verbal commands, such as an instruction to squeeze the physician\u2019s hands. In between the convulsive episodes, there were intermittent rocking movements of the upper body and nonrhythmic tremulous movements of the hands, and the patient did not speak or follow commands. After several hours, the episodes stopped, and the patient was able to speak. Admission to the hospital was recommended; however, the patient declined because of work obligations and anxiety about being in the hospital. He was discharged home.\nDuring the subsequent month, the patient continued to take levetiracetam and lamotrigine. However, the convulsions increased in frequency to one to three times per week.\nOn the morning before the current admission, while the patient was at work, his colleagues noticed that he abruptly stopped speaking and began to have shaking movements of the arms and legs. Emergency medical services were called. On their arrival, the patient\u2019s body was stiff, and there was twitching of the trunk, arms, and legs. No urinary or fecal incontinence or biting of the tongue had occurred. The patient was able to stand up from a chair and walk to the ambulance. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 111\/56 mm Hg, the pulse 83 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was awake and alert but did not speak. His eyes were open, with a primary midline gaze and blinking in response to visual threat. His body appeared stiff, with the arms and legs straightened. There were intermittent nonrhythmic tremulous movements of the trunk, arms, and legs. The patient was able to follow complex commands and to move the arms and legs symmetrically and against gravity, but there was a delay in motor activation. The deep-tendon reflexes were normal. Extensive scarring from burns was present on the face, trunk, back, arms, and legs.\nApproximately 45 minutes after the tremulous movements had stopped, the patient was able to speak but with limited fluency. Additional history was obtained. He had been taking levetiracetam and lamotrigine as directed; however, 3 days before this evaluation, he had stopped taking these medications because he was unsure whether they were effective. That morning, he had felt well until he noticed a sharp pain in the back of his head that radiated to his neck, along with sudden blurred vision, full-body numbness, and difficulty concentrating. A convulsive episode then occurred that lasted up to 20 minutes; during the episode, the patient was aware of events but sometimes had difficulty hearing. He described his overall mood as \u201cpretty good\u201d and did not report decreased energy or chronic fatigue. There was no history of psychotic or manic symptoms, suicidal ideation, or obsessive or compulsive behaviors.\nThe patient had a history of a febrile seizure in childhood, as well as several concussions that had occurred while he was playing sports in childhood. He reported that during the first 6 years of life, his social supports were limited, and he had experienced maltreatment by a family member; he did not elaborate on the nature of the maltreatment. In late childhood, he was involved in a house fire and hospitalized for a prolonged period because of severe burns on the face, body, arms, and legs. He had asthma, major depressive disorder, chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and panic disorder with agoraphobia. He took escitalopram daily and lorazepam as needed for panic attacks. He was in a long-term romantic relationship. He did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs; he smoked marijuana approximately once per year and drank one alcoholic beverage per week. His father had died of heart disease when the patient was a teenager; his mother had schizoaffective disorder and post-traumatic epilepsy.\nBlood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The blood lactate level was 2.4 mmol per liter (22 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.2 mmol per liter [5 to 20 mg per deciliter]) and the blood creatine kinase level 489 U per liter (reference range, 60 to 400). Serum and urine toxicologic panels were negative. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was admitted to this hospital.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the clinical vignette. The patient is a 27-year-old man admitted due to convulsions. The episodes have been occurring for two years, with some features that don't quite fit typical epileptic seizures. \n\nFirst, I need to note the key symptoms. The convulsions are often preceded by sharp head pain, blurred vision, palpitations, nausea, and difficulty concentrating. The episodes last several minutes, and there's urinary incontinence in one instance but no tongue biting. The patient is aware during some episodes, which is unusual for generalized tonic-clonic seizures. \n\nThe response to antiepileptic drugs like levetiracetam and lamotrigine hasn't been effective, which raises suspicion. Also, the EEG and MRI results are normal, further suggesting that these might not be epileptic in origin. \n\nDuring one episode, the shaking decreased when a physician placed a hand on the patient's shoulder and resumed when removed. The eyes were closed, and when opened manually, there was no nystagmus or gaze deviation. Bell's phenomenon was noted. The patient could follow commands during the episode, which is atypical for epileptic seizures. \n\nThe patient has a complex psychiatric history: major depressive disorder, chronic PTSD, panic disorder with agoraphobia. He also experienced maltreatment in early childhood and was in a house fire causing severe burns. His mother has schizoaffective disorder and post-traumatic epilepsy. \n\nGiven the inconsistency with typical seizure presentations, normal diagnostic workup, lack of response to medication, and the presence of significant psychological stressors, functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder) seems likely. The patient's episodes are consistent with functional seizures, especially given the variability in presentation and the influence of external factors like the physician's hand affecting the movements. \n\nConsidering the differential, somatic symptom disorder should be considered because of the preoccupation with symptoms, but the primary issue here seems to be the motor symptoms which align more with functional neurological disorder. Illness anxiety disorder is less likely as there's no excessive worry about having a serious illness. \n\nFactitious disorder or malingering are possibilities, but there's no clear evidence of intentional feigning for external incentives, so they're lower on the list. \n\nGiven the history of trauma and PTSD, along with panic disorder, these are important comorbidities. The patient's depressive disorder is also noted. So, the primary diagnosis is likely functional neurological symptom disorder, with other trauma-related and anxiety disorders as secondary diagnoses.",

    "vignette":"Only upon the repeated and fervent insistence of her parents did 19-year-old Emily reluctantly agree to see a psychiatrist. \u201cIt\u2019s not me you want to see,\u201d Emily proclaimed emphatically. \u201cIt\u2019s my insane parents who need your help.\u201d Emily did not offer a chief complaint, aside from the concern that her parents were driving her \u201ccrazy.\u201d She added, \u201cEverything is going great in my life. I have plenty of friends, go out almost every night, and always have lots of fun.\u201d\n\nWhile Emily was taking some time away from \u201cthe so-called real world,\u201d her sister was attending Duke University, her younger brother was excelling at a competitive private high school, and both her parents seemed to enjoy their careers as radiologists. She asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s enough strivers for one family?\u201d\n\nEmily agreed to have her parents join the session, and they told a different story. They tearfully disclosed that their daughter had become irritable, unproductive, and oppositional. She drank to intoxication almost every night, often not returning home for an entire weekend. In searching her room, they had found small amounts of marijuana, alprazolam (Xanax), cocaine, and prescription stimulants. The parents described the changes in Emily\u2019s personality as \u201can adolescent nightmare\u201d and described her friends as \u201closers who do nothing but dye their hair, get tattoos, and hate everything.\u201d Emily\u2019s attitudes and behavior contrasted markedly with those of her parents and siblings. \u201cWe don\u2019t mind that she is doing her own thing and that she isn\u2019t conservative like the rest of us,\u201d her father said, \u201cbut it\u2019s like we don\u2019t even recognize who she\u2019s become.\u201d\n\nAccording to her parents, Emily\u2019s \u201cadolescent nightmare\u201d began 4 years earlier. She had apparently been a studious 15-year-old girl with a lively sense of humor and a wide circle of \u201cterrific friends.\u201d \u201cAlmost overnight,\u201d she began to shun her longtime friends in favor of \u201cdropouts and malcontents\u201d and began to accumulate traffic tickets and school detentions. Instead of her former bright-eyed curiosity, Emily manifested a lack of interest in all her academic subjects, and her grades dropped from As to Ds. The parents were at an absolute loss to explain the sudden and dramatic change.\n\nThe abrupt change in performance led the psychiatrist to ask Emily to take a battery of neuropsychological tests so the results could be compared with those of tests that she had taken when she had applied to a private high school several years earlier. In particular, Emily retook two high school admissions tests: the System for Assessment and Group Evaluation (SAGE), which measures a broad array of academic and perceptual aptitudes, and the Differential Aptitude Tests (DAT), which focus on reasoning, spelling, and perceptual skills.\n\nOn the SAGE, her average percentile scores dropped from the upper 10% for a 13-year-old to the bottom 10% for an adult (and the bottom 20% for a 13-year-old). When Emily took the DAT at age 13, she scored in the highest range for ninth graders across almost all measures. Her worst result had been in spelling, where she scored at the second-highest level. Upon repeating the test at age 19, she scored below the high school average in all measures.\n\nEEG, brain CT, and T2-weighted brain MRI scans showed no evidence of structural brain damage. However, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) T2-weighted MRI displayed a clear lesion in the left frontal cortex, highly suggestive of previous injury to that region.\n\nUpon further questioning about the crucial period in which she seemed to have changed, Emily admitted to being in a traffic accident with her now ex-boyfriend, Mark. Although Emily did not recall much from this episode, she remembered that she hit her head and that she had bad headaches for many weeks thereafter. Because Emily was not bleeding and there was no damage to the car, neither Mark nor Emily reported the incident to anyone. With Emily\u2019s permission, the psychiatrist contacted Mark, who was away at college but a willing and excellent historian. He remembered the incident well. \u201cEmily hit her head very, very hard on the dashboard of my car. She was not totally unconscious but very dazed. For about 3 hours, she spoke very slowly, complained that her head hurt badly, and was confused. For about 2 hours she didn\u2019t know where she was or what day it was. She also threw up twice. I was really scared, but Emily didn\u2019t want me to worry her parents since they\u2019re so overprotective. And then she broke up with me, and we\u2019ve hardly spoken since.\u201d",

The frontal lobe injury likely explains the personality changes (disinhibition, impulsivity) and cognitive impairment.\n\nFor the primary diagnosis, neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury fits best given the clear temporal relationship and anatomical evidence. The substance use disorders are prominent but appear secondary to the behavioral dysregulation from the brain injury.

    "vignette":"Lucas Sandahl, a 32-year-old landscape architect, presented to a psychiatrist for help with anger. He came to the office with his wife, the mother of their two young children. The couple agreed that Mr. Sandahl had become \u201calmost impossible to live with.\u201d Mrs. Sandahl reported that although she had always considered her husband \u201chigh-strung,\u201d his outbursts were increasing in both frequency and intensity, and she worried that he would become violent with her.\n\nTheir most recent argument began when Mr. Sandahl came home after a \u201chard day at work\u201d to find that dinner was not ready. When he entered the kitchen and saw his wife sitting at the table reading the newspaper, he \u201cexploded\u201d and launched into a tirade about how \u201cbad\u201d a wife she was. When Mrs. Sandahl tried to explain her own long day, Mr. Sandahl cursed at her and broke glassware and a kitchen chair. Terrified, she ran out of the kitchen, gathered up the toddlers, and left for her mother\u2019s house a few miles away. The next day, she told her husband that he would need to get help immediately or prepare for a divorce.\n\nMr. Sandahl said his \u201cblowups\u201d began in childhood but did not become \u201cproblematic\u201d for him until age 13. At about that time, he started having frequent fights with classmates that would occasionally result in trips to the principal\u2019s office. In between the altercations, he was active socially and a solid student.\n\nMr. Sandahl estimated that he had had approximately four verbal outbursts a week in recent years, generally in response to frustration, unexpected demands, or perceived insults. In addition to these heated verbal tussles, Mr. Sandahl described acts of violence about every 2 months; for example, he threw a computer monitor across the room when it started \u201cacting up,\u201d he kicked a hole in a wall when one of his children would not quit crying, and he destroyed his mobile phone during an argument with his mother. He denied physical fights since his adolescence, although he had nearly come to blows with a neighbor as well as an assortment of strangers and employees. The idea that he might physically hurt someone scared Mr. Sandahl \u201cto the core.\u201d\n\nThese outbursts blighted his relationships with colleagues and romantic partners and led to his decision to start his own landscaping company at age 25. The business had done well, despite his demanding style and \u201chair-trigger\u201d temper that led to high employee turnover.\n\nMr. Sandahl described the episodes as short-lived, reaching a peak within seconds and rarely lasting more than a few minutes. Between episodes, he described himself as feeling \u201cfine.\u201d He had experienced brief periods of depressed mood and increased anxiety, but these had not impaired him significantly and tended to resolve on their own within a week. Mr. Sandahl drank socially, but neither he nor his wife linked the outbursts to the alcohol. He had a history of experimentation with various drugs of abuse, but not in recent years.\n\nMr. Sandahl reported at least two other immediate family members with significant \u201canger issues.\u201d His father was emotionally abusive and perfectionistic, expecting \u201cgreat things\u201d from his only son. Mr. Sandahl\u2019s older sister also had problems with her temper; he attributed her three divorces to her emotionally abusive behavior.\n\nOn examination, Mr. Sandahl was casually dressed, cooperative, and coherent. He was worried about his behavior and contrite toward his wife. He denied depression, psychosis, and confusion. He denied any thoughts of hurting himself or others. He was cognitively intact.

    "model_thoughts":"First, I need to diagnose the patient based on the clinical vignette. I must follow the rubric, but my response should only include the structured list of diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes, without any clinical reasoning. So, I'll base my answer solely on the information provided.\n\nKey points from the vignette:\n- Lucas Sandahl, 32-year-old, presents with anger issues.\n- Outbursts of anger, verbal and physical (breaking things), but no physical fights since adolescence.\n- Episodes are short-lived, peaking within seconds, lasting a few minutes.\n- Between episodes, he feels \"fine.\"\n- History of such behavior since childhood, problematic from age 13.\n- Frequent verbal outbursts (about four times a week) and acts of violence every 2 months.\n- Impact on relationships and work; high employee turnover.\n- No significant depression or anxiety that impairs him; brief periods resolve on their own.\n- Social drinking, no link to alcohol; past drug experimentation but not recent.\n- Family history: father emotionally abusive and perfectionistic; sister with temper issues.\n- Mental status exam: cooperative, coherent, contrite, denies depression, psychosis, suicidal or homicidal thoughts, cognitively intact, insight and judgment good during interview.\n\nNow, I need to identify DSM-5-TR diagnoses. The primary issue is anger outbursts. This sounds like Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED), which is characterized by recurrent behavioral outbursts representing a failure to control aggressive impulses.\n\nCheck DSM-5-TR criteria for IED:\n- Recurrent outbursts that demonstrate an inability to control aggressive impulses.\n- The outbursts are verbal aggression or physical aggression toward property, animals, or other individuals, occurring twice weekly on average for three months, or three behavioral outbursts involving damage or destruction of property and\/or physical assault within a 12-month period.\n- The aggression is out of proportion to the provocation.\n- The outbursts are not premeditated.\n- Cause marked distress or impairment in functioning.\n- Not better explained by another mental disorder, substance use, or medical condition.\n\nFrom the vignette:\n- Verbal outbursts about four times a week.\n- Acts of violence every 2 months (e.g., throwing monitor, kicking wall, destroying phone). This includes damage to property.\n- Outbursts are in response to frustration, unexpected demands, or perceived insults, suggesting they might be out of proportion.\n- Episodes are short-lived and not premeditated.\n- Causes distress and impairment in relationships and work.\n- No evidence of substance-induced or another mental disorder that better explains it. He denies depression and psychosis, and outbursts aren't linked to alcohol.\n\nSo, Intermittent Explosive Disorder seems fitting.\n\nOther possible diagnoses:\n- He has brief periods of depressed mood and increased anxiety, but they resolve on their own and don't significantly impair him. This could suggest Other Specified Depressive Disorder or Anxiety Disorder, but since they are brief and not impairing, they might not meet full criteria. However, for differential, I should consider.\n- Family history suggests possible traits or disorders, but not directly diagnosed in him.\n- No mention of bipolar disorder, PTSD, or other conditions that could explain anger outbursts.\n\nDifferential diagnosis:\n1. Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) \u2013 Primary diagnosis.\n2. Other conditions that might present with anger: \n   - Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD): But he's an adult, and ODD is typically diagnosed in children. DSM-5-TR allows for ODD in adults, but symptoms usually start in childhood. He has history since childhood, but the vignette focuses on adult outbursts. IED might be more appropriate.\n   - Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD): But this is for children and adolescents, up to age 18. He's 32, so not applicable.\n   - Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD): Could have anger issues, but no other symptoms like fear of abandonment, identity disturbance, etc. He seems stable between episodes, and insight is good.\n   - Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD): No evidence of conduct disorder before age 15, and he's contrite, worried about his behavior, so not fitting.\n   - Bipolar Disorder: No manic episodes described; outbursts are not part of mood episodes.\n   - PTSD: No trauma history mentioned.\n   - Substance Use Disorder: Social drinking, no recent drug use, and outbursts not linked to substances.\n\nGiven the information, IED is the most likely.\n\nFor secondary diagnoses, I need to consider other conditions that might be present, even if less prominent. From the vignette:\n- Brief periods of depressed mood: Could be Other Specified Depressive Disorder if it doesn't meet major depressive disorder criteria.\n- Increased anxiety: Similarly, Other Specified Anxiety Disorder.\n- Family history and perfectionistic traits: Might suggest traits of Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD) or other personality traits, but not enough for a full diagnosis.\n- He describes himself as \"high-strung,\" which could indicate generalized anxiety, but episodes are brief.\n\nSince the outbursts are the primary issue, and other symptoms are not impairing, I should list IED as primary and then consider other relevant diagnoses.\n\nList the top 5 most likely diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes:\n\nICD-10 codes:\n- Intermittent Explosive Disorder: F63.81\n- For depressive disorders: F32.x for depressive episode, but since brief and not specified, perhaps F32.9 Unspecified depressive disorder, or F32.8 Other specified depressive episodes. DSM-5-TR has categories like Other Specified Depressive Disorder, which might map to F32.8.\n- For anxiety: F41.8 Other specified anxiety disorders or F41.9 Unspecified anxiety disorder.\n\nBut I need to be precise based on DSM-5-TR.\n\nDSM-5-TR diagnoses and corresponding ICD-10 codes:\n- Intermittent Explosive Disorder: ICD-10 F63.81\n- Other Specified Depressive Disorder: F32.89 (or F32.8, but specific code might be F32.89 for other specified depressive episodes)\n- Other Specified Anxiety Disorder: F41.8\n- Possibly Adjustment Disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct, but not sure.\n- Or Personality Disorder traits, but not full disorder.\n\nThe vignette says he has brief periods of depressed mood and increased anxiety that resolve on their own. This could be cyclothymic disorder or persistent depressive disorder, but they are brief and not chronic. Cyclothymic disorder requires at least 2 years of numerous periods. Not likely.\n\nPerhaps Unspecified Mood Disorder or Unspecified Anxiety Disorder.\n\nBut to list 5 diagnoses, I need to include the most likely ones.\n\nPrimary: Intermittent Explosive Disorder.\n\nSecondary:\n1. Other Specified Depressive Disorder (for brief depressive episodes).\n2. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder (for brief anxiety periods).\n3. History of Substance Use Disorder? He experimented with drugs, but not recent, and no current use, so maybe Substance Use Disorder in remission, but not specified. Vignette says \"experimentation,\" which might not meet criteria for a disorder.\n4. Family history suggests possible genetic predisposition, but not a diagnosis for him.\n5. Rule out other conditions like ADHD? No symptoms of inattention or hyperactivity mentioned.\n\nPerhaps consider Relational Problems, like Partner Relational Problem, but that's not a mental disorder per se; it's a V-code in DSM-5-TR, and ICD-10 has Z-codes for factors influencing health status, not F-codes. The instruction says to give psychiatric diagnoses with F-codes, so I should stick to mental disorders.\n\nAnother possibility: Unspecified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder, but IED is already under that category.\n\nMaybe Oppositional Defiant Disorder in adults? But IED is more specific.\n\nTo have 5 diagnoses, I can list:\n1. Intermittent Explosive Disorder\n2. Other Specified Depressive Disorder\n3. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder\n4. History of Substance Use Disorder, unspecified, in remission (if applicable)\n5. No fifth clear diagnosis. Perhaps Adjustment Disorder, but no stressor mentioned other than daily frustrations.\n\nHe has perfectionistic traits from father, but not enough for OCPD.\n\nPerhaps Rule\/Out other conditions, but for list, I need to include likely diagnoses.\n\nThe vignette emphasizes anger outbursts, so IED is primary. Secondary might be comorbid mood and anxiety symptoms.\n\nList as per formatting:\n\n1. Primary: Intermittent Explosive Disorder\n2. Secondary: Other Specified Depressive Disorder\n3. Secondary: Other Specified Anxiety Disorder\n4. Secondary: Unspecified Substance Use Disorder, in remission? Or since he experimented, but no current issue, maybe not.\n5. Secondary: No other clear diagnosis. Perhaps \"No diagnosis\" but that's not a diagnosis.\n\nThe instruction says \"top 5 most likely diagnoses,\" so I need to list five, even if some are less likely. But based on information, only IED is clear; others are speculative.\n\nRe-read vignette: \"He had experienced brief periods of depressed mood and increased anxiety, but these had not impaired him significantly and tended to resolve on their own within a week.\" So, these might meet criteria for Other Specified Depressive or Anxiety Disorder if they cause distress but not full criteria for major disorders.\n\nAlso, \"He had a history of experimentation with various drugs of abuse, but not in recent years.\" This could be Substance Use Disorder, mild, in early remission, or simply no disorder if experimentation didn't lead to impairment.\n\nFor DSM-5-TR, if experimentation did not meet criteria for a substance use disorder, then no diagnosis. But the vignette doesn't specify impairment from drug use, so probably no current substance use disorder.\n\nPerhaps list:\n1. Intermittent Explosive Disorder\n2. Other Specified Depressive Disorder\n3. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder\n4. Unspecified Substance-Related Disorder? Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Since he has family history and traits, perhaps Other Specified Personality Disorder or traits, but not diagnosed.\n\nTo comply with the request for 5 diagnoses, I might include:\n1. Intermittent Explosive Disorder\n2. Other Specified Depressive Disorder\n3. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder\n4. Rule out Borderline Personality Disorder? But not enough evidence.\n5. Rule out Bipolar Disorder? Not likely.\n\nBut the response should be diagnoses, not rule-outs.\n\nPerhaps list IED as primary, and for secondary, include conditions that are common comorbidities or differentials.\n\nIn clinical practice, with anger issues, other considerations might include:\n- Unspecified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder (F91.9) but IED is more specific.\n- Adjustment Disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct (F43.25) if the outbursts are related to stressors, but no specific stressor mentioned.\n- He is \"high-strung,\" which could be Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1), but anxiety periods are brief.\n- For depressive episodes, if brief, could be Recurrent Brief Depressive Disorder, which is under Other Specified Depressive Disorder.\n\nDSM-5-TR has categories for recurrent brief depressive episodes.\n\nSo, likely:\n- Intermittent Explosive Disorder (F63.81)\n- Other Specified Depressive Disorder, with recurrent brief depressive episodes (F32.89)\n- Other Specified Anxiety Disorder (F41.8)\n- Perhaps Alcohol Use Disorder, mild? But he drinks socially, and no impairment mentioned, so probably not.\n- History of Drug Use Disorder in remission? But experimentation might not meet criteria.\n\nThe vignette says: \"He had a history of experimentation with various drugs of abuse, but not in recent years.\" This suggests past use but no current disorder. In DSM-5-TR, if past use did not meet criteria for a disorder, then no diagnosis. If it did, it might be in sustained remission.\n\nBut since no details, I'll skip substance use disorders.\n\nMaybe include V-codes for relational problems, but instruction says \"DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses\" and \"ICD-10 F-codes\", so only mental disorders with F-codes.\n\nICD-10 F-codes are for mental and behavioural disorders.\n\nFor the list, I'll go with:\n1. Intermittent Explosive Disorder\n2. Other Specified Depressive Disorder\n3. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder\n4. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (if Other Specified is not precise)\n5. Unspecified Depressive Disorder\n\nBut that's redundant.\n\nPerhaps add Oppositional Defiant Disorder? But for adults, it's coded under F91.3 for Oppositional Defiant Disorder, but typically for children. DSM-5-TR allows it for adults if symptoms were present in childhood and persist. He has history since childhood, but the vignette doesn't specify ODD symptoms like argumentativeness, defiance, etc.; it's more about outbursts.\n\nIED better captures the aggression.\n\nAnother possibility: Disruptive Behavior Disorder Not Otherwise Specified, but IED is specified.\n\nI think IED is primary, and for secondary, list the mood and anxiety specifiers.\n\nThe response format requires 5 diagnoses, so I need to list five even if some are less likely.\n\nBased on common comorbidities, I can list:\n1. Intermittent Explosive Disorder\n2. Other Specified Depressive Disorder\n3. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder\n4. Unspecified Personality Disorder with borderline features? Not enough evidence.\n5. History of Substance Use Disorder, unspecified, in early remission.\n\nBut to be conservative, stick to what's mentioned.\n\nFinal decision:\n- Primary: Intermittent Explosive Disorder (F63.81)\n- Secondary: Other Specified Depressive Disorder (F32.89) for brief depressive episodes.\n- Secondary: Other Specified Anxiety Disorder (F41.8) for brief anxiety periods.\n- Secondary: No other clear diagnosis. Perhaps \"No other diagnosis\" but that's not a diagnosis.\n\nThe instruction says \"top 5 most likely diagnoses,\" implying that I should list five. So, for the fourth and fifth, I can include differentials that are possible but less likely.\n\nPerhaps:\n4. Rule Out Borderline Personality Disorder (F60.3) but not confirmed.\n5. Rule Out Bipolar II Disorder (F31.81) for mood swings.\n\nBut again, not diagnoses.\n\nI should list actual diagnoses based on criteria.\n\nFrom the vignette, only IED is strongly supported; mood and anxiety are mentioned but not detailed. So, for the list:\n1. Intermittent Explosive Disorder\n2. Other Specified Depressive Disorder\n3. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder\n4. Unspecified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder (as an alternative if IED doesn't fit perfectly, but it does)\n5. Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Disturbance of Emotions and Conduct (F43.25) if considering stressors from work or family.\n\nHe has work stress and family demands, but outbursts are chronic, not adjustment to a specific stressor.\n\nI think for this case, the top diagnosis is IED, and secondary are mood and anxiety symptoms that don't meet full criteria for other disorders.\n\nSo, list:\n1. Intermittent Explosive Disorder - F63.81\n2. Other Specified Depressive Disorder - F32.89\n3. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder - F41.8\n4. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder - F41.9 (as a possibility)\n5. Unspecified Depressive Disorder - F32.9\n\nBut that's repetitive. Better to have distinct diagnoses.\n\nPerhaps include Substance Use Disorder, but no current use.\n\nAnother idea: Since he has perfectionistic traits from father, and high standards, perhaps Other Specified Personality Disorder (F60.89) with obsessive-compulsive traits, but not enough for OCPD.\n\nI recall that in DSM-5-TR, for cases with anger, sometimes Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder is used.\n\nBut I think the safest is to list IED as primary, and for secondary, list conditions that are commonly associated or mentioned.\n\nI'll proceed with:\n1. Intermittent Explosive Disorder - F63.81\n2. Other Specified Depressive Disorder - F32.89\n3. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder - F41.8\n4. Unspecified Substance Use Disorder, in remission - F19.20 for unspecified drug, but since multiple drugs, perhaps F19.20 for other psychoactive substance use disorder, in remission.\n5. Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Adult Onset? But IED is more appropriate.\n\nGiven the rubric, I need to be an expert, so I should accurately diagnose based on DSM-5-TR.\n\nUpon reflection, the brief periods of depressed mood and anxiety might not warrant a separate diagnosis if they are part of the IED or if they are subclinical. However, for completeness, I'll include them.\n\nFor the fourth and fifth, I can list conditions that are differentials but less likely, such as:\n- Borderline Personality Disorder - F60.3\n- Bipolar Disorder - F31.9\n\nBut from the vignette, he denies depression and psychosis, and outbursts are not mood-congruent, so bipolar is unlikely. Borderline personality: no instability in relationships, self-image, etc., so unlikely.\n\nPerhaps list:\n4. History of Substance Abuse, not meeting criteria for disorder? In DSM-5-TR, Substance Use Disorder has criteria, and if not met, no diagnosis. So, if experimentation didn't cause impairment, no diagnosis.\n\nThe vignette doesn't specify impairment from drugs, so probably no substance use disorder.\n\nSo, for the list, I'll stick to:\n1. Intermittent Explosive Disorder\n2. Other Specified Depressive Disorder\n3. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder\n4. No other diagnosis, but since I need five, perhaps \"Unspecified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder\" as a catch-all, but IED is specified.\n\nI think for this case, the primary is clear, and secondary are the mood and anxiety specifiers. To have five, I can add \"Rule Out\" diagnoses, but the instruction says \"diagnoses,\" so I should list actual diagnoses.\n\nAnother thought: He might have Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) with impulsivity, but no symptoms of inattention or hyperactivity mentioned.\n\nSo, I'll go with three diagnoses and for the fourth and fifth, use unspecified categories.\n\nList:\n1. Intermittent Explosive Disorder - F63.81\n2. Other Specified Depressive Disorder - F32.89\n3. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder - F41.8\n4. Unspecified Depressive Disorder - F32.9 (if Other Specified is not used)\n5. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder - F41.9\n\nBut that seems like padding.\n\nPerhaps include Adjustment Disorder, but as said, not specific.\n\nI recall that in DSM-5-TR, for anger issues not meeting IED, there is Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder (F91.8). But here, it meets IED.\n\nTo make it five, I'll list:\n1. Intermittent Explosive Disorder - F63.81\n2. Other Specified Depressive Disorder - F32.89\n3. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder - F41.8\n4. Unspecified Substance Use Disorder, in remission - F19.20 (assuming past substance use met criteria, but not specified)\n5. Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Mild, Adult - F91.3\n\nBut ODD in adults is coded under F91.3, and DSM-5-TR allows it if symptoms persist from childhood.\n\nFrom vignette: \"blowups began in childhood\" and \"frequent fights with classmates,\" which could be ODD symptoms, but IED is more specific for aggression outbursts.\n\nI think IED is the correct primary diagnosis.\n\nFor the response, I'll provide the list as per formatting.\n\nFinal list:\n1. Intermittent Explosive Disorder - F63.81\n2. Other Specified Depressive Disorder - F32.89\n3. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder - F41.8\n4. Unspecified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder - F91.9 (as a less specific alternative)\n5. Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Disturbance of Emotions and Conduct - F43.25\n\nBut I should base it on likelihood. From the vignette, IED is most likely, and mood\/anxiety are secondary. The others are not strongly supported.\n\nTo adhere to the instruction, I'll list only the diagnoses that are directly inferred from the vignette.\n\nPerhaps the vignette is testing for IED, and other conditions are not intended to be diagnosed.\n\nBut the instruction says \"top 5 most likely diagnoses,\" so I need to list five.\n\nI'll proceed with:\n1. Intermittent Explosive Disorder - F63.81\n2. Other Specified Depressive Disorder - F32.89\n3. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder - F41.8\n4. Unspecified Depressive Disorder - F32.9\n5. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder - F41.9\n\nThis covers the symptoms mentioned.\n\nNo, that's not good clinical practice. Better to list distinct diagnoses.\n\nAnother idea: Since he has family history of anger issues, and his own history, perhaps Personality Disorder Not Otherwise Specified with impulsive and aggressive traits.\n\nBut for now, I'll use the list with IED primary, and for secondary, include the mood and anxiety disorders as specified.\n\nI think this should be acceptable.",

    "vignette":"J is a mid-20s military service member living independently in the community with a partner. J has a history of multiple ACEs (ACE scale score of 10\/10), with caregivers that were both physically and emotionally abusive when J's needs were voiced, resulting in a belief that it was unacceptable, unsafe, and futile to resolve interpersonal problems with caregivers, thus creating a sense of powerlessness and helplessness. Child and family services were never involved, and no legal charges were ever laid against the family for the abuse that J endured. J struggled with containing anger since early childhood resulting in physical and verbal aggression towards peers and teachers at school and family members at home. Caregivers attempted to contain J's aggressive behavior through forced administration of psychiatric medication. While growing up, J feared others and preferred to be alone, despite longing for family and friends. Socialization with peers proved difficult, as J was easily overwhelmed by noise associated with social contact and was frequently ridiculed or misunderstood while trying to verbally communicate.\n\nAs a young adult, J left family to enter the military, which became an immediate source of attachment and social belonging. More recently, J became increasingly unable to cope with anger following an ill-suited work position and a musculoskeletal injury, resulting in frequent angry verbal altercations and threats of violence towards military peers who placed restrictions on his activities. This led to disciplinary action and isolation from the unit, which further increased anger, hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts and led to a psychiatric military assessment. During the assessment, J disclosed feelings of intense anger which eventually manifested in an attack on a family member in an amnestic dissociated state. J's history indicated that pharmacological treatments had either been ineffective or caused significant side effects. The military psychiatrist determined J ought to be considered for military discharge. This triggered flashbacks of past childhood abuse and a significant increase in rage. J refused trials of psychiatric medications in the community due to a childhood history of forced medication administration. Due to significant safety concerns and limited ability to control aggressive behavior in the community, J's military psychiatrist referred J for an inpatient admission.\n\nOn initial assessment for admission, J appeared distrustful, angry, and concerned about acting out on anger and expressed suicidal ideation. On mental status examination, J was tall and appeared neatly dressed in a military uniform. J appeared hypervigilant and intensely watchful and was well spoken, using a \u201csharp\u201d tone of voice. J provided a detailed history, demonstrating a goal-directed thought form and a high level of abstract thinking, logical analysis, and good recall. There were no delusions or hallucinations, but J endorsed prominent active suicidal ideation, with intent to act upon these thoughts if not hospitalized; however, there were no immediate, specific suicide plans.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, the user wants me to act as an expert psychiatrist and diagnose based on a clinical vignette. Let me start by carefully reading the vignette. Ben is a 12-month-old infant with several notable features: distinct facial characteristics like widely spaced eyes and low-set ears, a cat-like cry, history of low birth weight, heart issues requiring NICU stay, feeding problems, hypotonia, excessive drooling, microcephaly, and a fixed splitting heart sound. The father mentions a recent geneticist visit awaiting results.\n\nHmm, the symptoms point towards a genetic syndrome. The cat-like cry is classic for Cri-du-chat syndrome. But let's cross-check other features. Hypotonia, feeding difficulties, and developmental delays align with that. However, the heart issue and facial dysmorphism could also fit other conditions. Wait, the vignette specifies \"awaiting genetic results,\" so the diagnosis isn't confirmed yet.\n\nConsidering DSM-5-TR, I need to focus on psychiatric diagnoses. Cri-du-chat often involves intellectual disability and possible autism spectrum traits. But Ben is only 12 months, so definitive ASD might be premature. Still, early signs could justify a provisional diagnosis. The heart murmur and feeding issues might indicate medical conditions, but those aren't psychiatric.\n\nPrimary diagnosis should be the most fitting based on presented symptoms. Cri-du-chat syndrome (CDCS) is top due to the cat cry and facial features. Next, intellectual disability is almost certain given global delays. Feeding issues could be a separate disorder, but might be part of the syndrome. Same for the heart condition\u2014likely congenital, but not psychiatric.\n\nWait, the user wants only DSM-5-TR diagnoses with F-codes. So I need to map each to ICD-10. Cri-du-chat falls under chromosomal abnormalities, but DSM-5 might code it as intellectual disability. Let me think: DSM-5 doesn't list syndromes by name, so I'll use the closest psychiatric equivalent. CDCS often co-occurs with severe intellectual disability, so F78 might apply. But if it's confirmed, the code should be under chromosomal anomalies (Q93.4), but that's not an F-code. Hmm, the user insists on F-codes only, so I'll stick to psychiatric classifications even if the underlying cause is genetic.\n\nProvisional diagnoses make sense here since genetic results are pending. Anxiety disorder might be considered due to distress when alone, but that could be normal infant behavior. Better to include it as a secondary possibility. Feeding disorder is clear from the gastroenterology visits.\n\nLet me list them out:\n1. Cri-du-chat syndrome (provisional) \u2013 but need an F-code. Maybe F88 (Other disorders of psychological development)? No, that's not specific. Perhaps F84.9 for pervasive developmental disorder unspecified? But intellectual disability is more fitting. I'll use F78 for severe intellectual disability as primary, noting CDCS as the likely cause.\n2. Severe intellectual disability \u2013 F72\n3. Unspecified feeding or eating disorder \u2013 F98.29\n4. Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition \u2013 F06.4\n5. Unspecified congenital malformation of heart \u2013 but that's not psychiatric, so maybe avoid. Instead, consider reactive attachment disorder due to distress, but not enough info. Maybe adjustment disorder? No, better to stick with anxiety.\n\nWait, the user said top 5 with primary and four secondaries. I need to ensure each has an F-code. Let me check ICD-10 codes: Intellectual disability codes range from F70-F79. Feeding disorder is F98.29. Anxiety due to medical condition is F06.4. For Cri-du-chat, maybe F84.0 for autism spectrum, but too early. Perhaps F88 for other developmental disorders. \n\nI think I have it: primary is severe intellectual disability due to suspected CDCS, then feeding disorder, anxiety due to medical condition, provisional autism spectrum, and maybe another neurodevelopmental disorder. But the vignette doesn't mention autism traits specifically. Instead, the heart issue is medical, so maybe avoid non-psychiatric codes. \n\nFinal list:\n1. Severe intellectual disability (provisional, associated with Cri-du-chat syndrome) \u2013 F72\n2. Unspecified feeding disorder of infancy or early childhood \u2013 F98.29\n3. Anxiety disorder due to known physiological condition (congenital heart defect) \u2013 F06.4\n4. Global developmental delay \u2013 F88\n5. Unspecified disorder of psychological development \u2013 F89\n\nYes, that seems comprehensive and sticks to psychiatric diagnoses with F-codes. Let me confirm each matches the symptoms. Hypotonia and delays support developmental disorders. Feeding issues are separate. Anxiety from medical issues and distress when alone. Good.",

    "vignette":"Olivia Jacobs, a 22-year-old graduate student in architecture, was referred for an urgent psychiatric consultation after she told her roommate that she was suicidal. Ms. Jacobs had a history of mood symptoms that had been under good control with lithium and sertraline, but her depressive symptoms had returned soon after she had arrived in a new city for school, 3 months earlier. She had become preoccupied with ways in which she might kill herself without inconveniencing others. Her dominant suicidal thoughts involved shooting herself in the head while leaning out the window, so as not to cause a mess in the dorm. Although she did not have access to a gun, she spent time searching the Web for places where she might purchase one.\n\nMs. Jacobs\u2019s psychiatric history began at age 15, when she began to regularly drink alcohol and smoke marijuana, usually when out at dance clubs with friends. Both of these substances calmed her, and she denied that either had become problematic. She had used neither alcohol nor marijuana since starting graduate school.\n\nAround age 17, she began experiencing brief, intense depressive episodes, marked by tearfulness, feelings of guilt, anhedonia, hopelessness, low energy, and poor concentration. She would sleep more than 12 hours a day and neglect responsibilities at school and home.\n\nThese depressive episodes would generally shift after a few weeks into periods of increased energy, pressured speech, and unusual creativity. She would stay up most of the night working on projects and building architectural models. These revved-up episodes lasted about 5 days and were punctuated by feelings that her friends had turned against her and that they were not really friends at all. Worried especially about the paranoia, her family had brought her to a psychiatrist, who diagnosed her as having bipolar II disorder and prescribed lithium and sertraline. Although Ms. Jacobs\u2019s moods did not completely stabilize on this regimen, she did well enough at a local university to be accepted into a prestigious graduate program far from home. At that point the depression returned, and she became intensely suicidal for the first time.\n\nUpon evaluation, the patient was visibly depressed and tearful, and had psychomotor slowing. She said it was very difficult to get out of bed and she was not attending class most days. She reported hopelessness, poor concentration, and guilt about spending family money for school when she was not able to perform. She stated that she thought about suicide most of the time and that she had found nothing to distract her. She denied recent drinking or smoking marijuana, stating she did not feel like \u201cpartying.\u201d She acknowledged profound feelings of emptiness and indicated that she had occasionally cut her arms superficially to \u201csee what it would feel like.\u201d She stated that she knew that cutting herself in this way would not kill her. She reported depersonalization and occasional panic attacks. She denied having mood instability, derealization, problems with impulsivity, concerns about her identity, and fears of abandonment.",

When evaluator pointed out her behavior, patient immediately becomes tearful and apologetic, stating,\u201d I didn\u2019t do anything, I didn\u2019t mean it, I didn\u2019t even hit you.\u201d Guardian states that behaviors like this is what she is referring to.

These behaviors occur multiple times weekly, are disproportionate to triggers, and cause significant impairment in school and foster placements.\n\nFor differential diagnosis, I need to consider disorders characterized by chronic irritability and behavioral dyscontrol. The recurrent temper outbursts and persistent irritability strongly suggest Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder as the primary diagnosis, given the age of onset before 10 years and duration over a year. \n\nOppositional Defiant Disorder must be considered given the argumentativeness and blaming others, though the severity of outbursts exceeds typical ODD. Intermittent Explosive Disorder is possible but less likely given the chronic irritability between outbursts. Adjustment Disorder with disturbance of conduct could relate to her unstable care history. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder should be considered given her background, though trauma symptoms aren't explicitly described.\n\nThe rapid mood shift during evaluation (anger to tearful apology) is notable but doesn't meet criteria for bipolar disorder. No evidence of ADHD inattentive\/hyperactive symptoms or autism spectrum rigidity. The behaviors appear reactive rather than planned, ruling out Conduct Disorder.\n\nI'll organize these by diagnostic priority based on symptom fit and DSM-5-TR hierarchy.",

The patient frequently punches her mother in the legs, and in the stomach, and the patient even threw her ipad at the pediatrician when she asked the patient what was upsetting her. Most of the patients psychiatric history is gathered from her mother, given how irritable the patient is during the exam.

    "model_thoughts":"First, I need to read the clinical case vignette carefully. The patient is Neveah, a 14-year-old girl, presenting with \"out of control behaviors at home.\" Key behaviors include restlessness, punching her mother (including in the stomach, which is notable since the mother is 4 months pregnant), and throwing an iPad at the pediatrician.\n\nFrom the history: Neveah was born 8 weeks premature, spent a month in NICU for breathing problems, but met developmental milestones on time. She was \"clingy\" as a toddler but had no issues making friends.\n\nAt age 11, her father left to join the military and deployed. At age 12, around summertime, she had episodes of being more talkative, energetic, needing only 3 hours of sleep, impulsive, and had grandiose beliefs (thinking she had super powers to make friends get in trouble). She also had frequent temper tantrums disproportionate to circumstances, lasting several hours daily. These episodes lasted several weeks, with periods of months returning to normal. No hallucinations or sad\/depressed mood reported. She was hospitalized at age 13 during such an episode. She refuses medications. This academic year, similar symptoms reappeared: irritability, violence, reduced need for sleep, fast talking, property destruction.\n\nNow, I need to diagnose based on DSM-5-TR criteria. I must provide a structured list of the top 5 most likely diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes. Only psychiatric diagnoses using F-codes, no non-psychiatric ones.\n\nI should base my answer only on the information provided and my clinical expertise, without fabricating details. The response should be only the list, no clinical reasoning.\n\nLet me identify possible diagnoses:\n\n1. **Primary Diagnosis**: The symptoms suggest a mood disorder with manic or hypomanic episodes. Key features: periods of elevated mood, increased energy, reduced need for sleep, grandiosity, impulsivity, irritability, and temper tantrums. These episodes last several weeks with periods of normalcy. No depressive episodes mentioned. This sounds like **Bipolar Disorder**. Specifically, given the age and presentation, possibly **Bipolar I Disorder** if there was a manic episode leading to hospitalization, or **Bipolar II Disorder** if hypomanic episodes. But in DSM-5-TR, for children and adolescents, manic episodes can present with irritability rather than euphoria. The hospitalization at age 13 suggests severity. Also, the current episode includes violence and property destruction. Considering the episodic nature and symptoms, **Bipolar I Disorder, most recent episode manic** could fit. However, I need to check if criteria are met.\n\n   DSM-5-TR criteria for Bipolar I Disorder, Manic Episode: A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and increased activity or energy, lasting at least 1 week (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary). During this period, three or more of the following (four if mood is irritable): inflated self-esteem or grandiosity, decreased need for sleep, more talkative, flight of ideas or subjective experience, distractibility, increase in goal-directed activity or psychomotor agitation, excessive involvement in activities with high potential for painful consequences. Here, Neveah has irritable mood, decreased need for sleep (3 hours), talkative, grandiosity (super powers), impulsivity, and psychomotor agitation (restlessness, violence). The hospitalization at 13 indicates severity. So, likely Bipolar I Disorder.\n\n   But in children and adolescents, there can be **Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD)**, which involves severe recurrent temper outbursts and persistent irritability. However, DMDD requires symptoms to be present for 12 or more months, with no more than 3 months without symptoms, and onset before age 10. Here, Neveah's symptoms started around age 12, and she has episodic periods with months of normalcy. DMDD is more chronic and persistent, not episodic. So, Bipolar Disorder seems more fitting.\n\n   Also, consider **Cyclothymic Disorder**, but episodes here are more severe and with mania-like symptoms.\n\n   Given the violence and impulsivity, **Intermittent Explosive Disorder** might be considered, but the episodic nature with mood symptoms points more towards bipolar.\n\n2. **Secondary Diagnoses**: Need to list four more.\n\n   - **Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD)**: Characterized by angry\/irritable mood, argumentative\/defiant behavior, or vindictiveness. Neveah shows irritability, aggression (punching mother), temper tantrums. But these seem part of the mood episodes. ODD is often comorbid with bipolar disorder in children.\n\n   - **Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)**: Symptoms like restlessness, impulsivity. But in bipolar disorder, these can overlap. The vignette mentions impulsivity during episodes, but not necessarily pervasive across settings. ADHD symptoms should be present before age 12 and in multiple contexts. Here, she was \"clingy\" but no mention of ADHD symptoms earlier. However, premature birth and NICU stay might increase risk for ADHD. But based on provided info, not explicitly stated.\n\n   - **Conduct Disorder**: Aggression to people and animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness or theft, serious violations of rules. Neveah punches mother and destroys property, but this seems episodic and tied to mood episodes. Conduct disorder is more persistent pattern.\n\n   - **Anxiety Disorders**: She was \"clingy\" as a toddler, which might suggest separation anxiety, but no current anxiety symptoms mentioned.\n\n   - **Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)**: Father left and deployed, but no clear trauma mentioned. However, parental separation could be stressful, but not necessarily PTSD.\n\n   - **Adjustment Disorder**: With the father leaving, but symptoms seem beyond a normal adjustment reaction.\n\n   - **Psychotic Disorders**: No hallucinations or delusions mentioned, grandiosity might be part of mania.\n\n   - **Disruptive Behavior Disorders**: ODD or Conduct Disorder as comorbidities.\n\n   Since the vignette focuses on episodic mood symptoms with irritability and aggression, I should prioritize mood and related disorders.\n\n   List of possible secondary diagnoses:\n   - Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) \u2013 given the defiant and aggressive behaviors.\n   - Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) \u2013 possible due to restlessness and impulsivity, but need to confirm pervasiveness.\n   - Intermittent Explosive Disorder \u2013 for recurrent behavioral outbursts, but criteria require outbursts not better explained by another disorder; here, likely part of bipolar.\n   - Anxiety Disorder Not Otherwise Specified \u2013 but limited info.\n\n   Based on common comorbidities in pediatric bipolar disorder, ODD and ADHD are frequent.\n\n   Also, consider **Unspecified Bipolar and Related Disorder** if not full criteria, but she seems to meet criteria for bipolar I.\n\n   For ICD-10 codes:\n   - Bipolar I Disorder, current episode manic: F31.1 (Bipolar disorder, current episode manic without psychotic features) or F31.9 if unspecified. Since no psychosis mentioned, F31.1.\n   - ODD: F91.3\n   - ADHD: F90.9 (Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, unspecified type)\n   - Conduct Disorder: F91.8 or F91.9\n   - Intermittent Explosive Disorder: F63.81\n\n   But I need the top 5 most likely, with primary first.\n\n   Primary: Bipolar I Disorder\n\n   Secondary:\n   1. Oppositional Defiant Disorder \u2013 common comorbidity.\n   2. Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder \u2013 possible, given symptoms.\n   3. Intermittent Explosive Disorder \u2013 for explosive outbursts.\n   4. Adjustment Disorder with disturbance of conduct \u2013 but since bipolar is primary, this might be secondary.\n\n   However, DSM-5-TR allows multiple diagnoses if criteria met.\n\n   Let's ensure diagnoses are based on provided info. The vignette says during episodes, she has symptoms like reduced sleep, talkativeness, grandiosity, irritability, tantrums. Between episodes, months of normal mood and behavior. This is classic for bipolar disorder.\n\n   For secondary, the aggression and defiance might warrant ODD. But ODD requires a pattern of behavior for at least 6 months, with symptoms present during mood episodes? In bipolar, if symptoms occur only during mood episodes, they might not be separate. However, in children, comorbid ODD is common.\n\n   From the vignette: \"periods of months returning to normal mood and behavior.\" So, during normal periods, no symptoms? Then ODD might not be persistent. But it says \"around 12 years of age\" episodes started, and now at 14, similar symptoms reappeared. There might be a chronic pattern of irritability and aggression, but it's episodic.\n\n   Perhaps **Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD)** but as I thought, DMDD requires chronic irritability between outbursts, and onset before 10. Here, onset at 12, and episodic with normal periods, so not DMDD.\n\n   Another consideration: **Pediatric Acute-Onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANS)** or something, but not in DSM-5-TR.\n\n   Stick to DSM-5-TR.\n\n   Primary: F31.1 Bipolar disorder, current episode manic without psychotic features\n\n   Secondary possibilities:\n   - F91.3 Oppositional defiant disorder\n   - F90.9 Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, unspecified\n   - F63.81 Intermittent explosive disorder\n   - F43.25 Adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct\n\n   But adjustment disorder typically within 3 months of stressor; here, father left at 11, symptoms at 12, so timing might not fit.\n\n   Since she refuses medications, no substance use mentioned.\n\n   Also, premature birth and NICU might relate to neurodevelopmental disorders, but no specific symptoms.\n\n   I think the top 5 should be:\n   1. Bipolar I Disorder\n   2. Oppositional Defiant Disorder\n   3. ADHD\n   4. Intermittent Explosive Disorder\n   5. Conduct Disorder\n\n   But conduct disorder requires more criteria like aggression to others, destruction of property, deceitfulness, theft, etc. She has aggression and property destruction, but during episodes. Conduct disorder is a repetitive pattern.\n\n   Perhaps list based on likelihood.\n\n   Most likely primary: Bipolar I Disorder.\n\n   Then, given the behaviors, ODD is a common comorbidity.\n\n   ADHD might be present, but not explicitly stated; however, restlessness and impulsivity are noted.\n\n   Intermittent Explosive Disorder: outbursts of aggression disproportionate to provocation, but in bipolar, these are part of mania.\n\n   In DSM-5, intermittent explosive disorder is diagnosed if outbursts are not better explained by another mental disorder, so if bipolar explains them, IED might not be separate.\n\n   So, secondary diagnoses should be those that can coexist or are comorbid.\n\n   After bipolar, consider:\n   - ODD: F91.3\n   - ADHD: F90.9\n   - Unspecified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder: F91.9 if not full criteria for ODD or conduct disorder.\n   - Adjustment Disorder: F43.24 with disturbance of emotions and conduct? But not sure.\n\n   Another thought: **Cyclothymic Disorder** but episodes seem more severe.\n\n   Let's list based on provided symptoms.\n\n   Final list:\n   1. Bipolar I Disorder, current episode manic - F31.1\n   2. Oppositional Defiant Disorder - F91.3\n   3. Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder, Combined Presentation - F90.2 (since she has both inattention? Not mentioned, but impulsivity and hyperactivity; but combined type requires inattention symptoms too. Unspecified might be better: F90.9)\n   4. Intermittent Explosive Disorder - F63.81\n   5. Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder - F91.8 (if not full criteria for others)\n\n   But I need to ensure that diagnoses are based on info. The vignette doesn't provide enough for ADHD inattention, so perhaps ADHD unspecified.\n\n   Also, for IED, criteria include recurrent behavioral outbursts representing a failure to control aggressive impulses, with magnitude out of proportion to provocation. Here, tantrums disproportionate to circumstances, but during mood episodes. So, if bipolar is present, IED might not be diagnosed separately unless outbursts occur outside mood episodes. The vignette says during episodes, tantrums every day; between episodes, months normal. So, likely all symptoms are part of bipolar.\n\n   In clinical practice, comorbidities are common, but for this exercise, I should list the most likely based on DSM-5-TR.\n\n   Perhaps after bipolar, the next most likely is ODD, then ADHD, then IED, then conduct disorder.\n\n   But let's see the formatting: I need to output only the list.\n\n   I recall that in pediatric bipolar disorder, irritability can be a key feature, and comorbidities like ODD and ADHD are high.\n\n   So, I'll go with:\n\n   Primary: Bipolar I Disorder\n\n   Secondary:\n   1. Oppositional Defiant Disorder\n   2. Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder\n   3. Intermittent Explosive Disorder\n   4. Conduct Disorder\n\n   But conduct disorder requires more symptoms like bullying, fighting, using weapons, etc. Not mentioned here.\n\n   Property destruction is mentioned, so conduct disorder might be considered.\n\n   From DSM-5, conduct disorder criteria: aggression to people and animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness or theft, serious violations of rules. Here, she punches mother (aggression to people), throws iPad (could be aggression), property destruction. But for diagnosis, need at least three criteria in past 12 months, with at least one in past 6 months. Possible, but not detailed.\n\n   Since the vignette is brief, I should stick to clear diagnoses.\n\n   Another idea: **Unspecified Bipolar and Related Disorder** if not sure, but hospitalization suggests mania.\n\n   I think Bipolar I is appropriate.\n\n   For ICD-10 codes:\n   - F31.1 for Bipolar disorder, current episode manic without psychotic features\n   - F91.3 for Oppositional defiant disorder\n   - F90.9 for Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, unspecified\n   - F63.81 for Intermittent explosive disorder\n   - F91.8 for Other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder (or F91.9 for Unspecified)\n\n   But F91.8 requires specification; perhaps F91.9 for Unspecified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder.\n\n   Let's check ICD-10 codes:\n   - Bipolar disorder, manic episode without psychotic symptoms: F31.1\n   - Oppositional defiant disorder: F91.3\n   - Hyperkinetic disorder, unspecified: F90.9 (for ADHD)\n   - Intermittent explosive disorder: F63.81\n   - Conduct disorder, unspecified: F91.9\n\n   Yes.\n\n   Now, order: primary first, then secondaries in likelihood.\n\n   So, final list:\n   1. Bipolar I Disorder, current episode manic - F31.1\n   2. Oppositional Defiant Disorder - F91.3\n   3. Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder, Unspecified Type - F90.9\n   4. Intermittent Explosive Disorder - F63.81\n   5. Conduct Disorder, Unspecified - F91.9\n\n   I think this covers the behavioral symptoms.\n\n   Ensure no fabrication: based on vignette, bipolar is clear, ODD and ADHD are common comorbidities, IED and conduct disorder are possible given aggression and destruction.\n\n   But in the response, I must not include clinical reasoning, just the list.\n\n   So, I'll output as specified.",

    "vignette":"Ashley, age 17, was referred for a diagnostic reevaluation after having carried diagnoses of autism and intellectual disability for almost all of her life. She was recently found to have Kleefstra syndrome, and the family wanted to reconfirm the earlier diagnoses and assess the genetic risk to the future children of her older sisters.\n\nAt the time of the reevaluation, Ashley was attending a special school with a focus on functional skills. She was able to dress herself, but she was not able to shower independently or be left alone in the house. She was able to decode (e.g., read words) and spell at a second-grade level but understood little of what she read. Changes to her schedule and heightened functional expectations tended to make her irritable. When upset, Ashley would often hurt herself (e.g., biting her wrist) and others (e.g., pinching and hair pulling).\n\nIn formal testing done at the time of the reevaluation, Ashley had a nonverbal IQ of 39 and a verbal IQ of 23, with a full scale IQ of 31. Her adaptive scores were somewhat higher, with an overall score of 42 (with 100 as average).\n\nBy history, Ashley first received services at age 9 months after her parents noticed significant motor delays. She walked at 20 months and was toilet trained at 5 years. She spoke her first word at age 6. She received a diagnosis of developmental delay at age 3 and of autism, obesity, and static encephalopathy at age 4. An early evaluation noted possible facial dysmorphology; genetic tests at that time were noncontributory.\n\nHer parents indicated that Ashley knew hundreds of single words and many simple phrases. She had long been very interested in license plates and would draw them for hours. Her strongest skill was memory, and she could draw precise representations of license plates from different states. Ashley had always been very attached to her parents and sisters, and although affectionate toward babies, she showed minimal interest in other teenagers.\n\nAshley\u2019s family history was pertinent for a father with dyslexia, a paternal uncle with epilepsy, and a maternal male cousin with possible \u201cAsperger\u2019s syndrome.\u201d Her siblings, both sisters, were in college and doing well.\n\nOn examination, Ashley was an overweight young woman who made inconsistent eye contact but often peered out the corner of her eye. She had a beautiful smile and would sometimes laugh to herself, but most of the time her facial expressions were subdued. She did not initiate joint attention by trying to catch another person\u2019s eyes. She frequently ignored what others would say to her. To request a preferred object (e.g., a shiny magazine), Ashley would rock from foot to foot and point. When offered an object (e.g., a small decorated box), she brought it to her nose and lips for inspection. Ashley spoke in a high-pitched voice with unusual intonation. During the interview, she used multiple words and a few short phrases that were somewhat rote but communicative, such as \u201cI want to clean up,\u201d and \u201cDo you have a van?\u201d\n\nIn the months prior to the evaluation, Ashley\u2019s parents noticed that she had become increasingly apathetic. A medical evaluation concluded that urinary tract infections were the most likely cause for her symptoms, but antibiotics seemed only to make her more listless. Further medical evaluation led to more extensive genetic testing, and Ashley was diagnosed with Kleefstra syndrome, a rare genetic defect associated with multiple medical problems, including intellectual developmental disorder. The parents said they were also tested and found to \u201cbe negative.\u201d\n\nThe parents specifically wanted to know whether the genetic testing results affected Ashley\u2019s long-standing diagnoses and access to future services. Furthermore, they wanted to know whether their other two daughters should get tested for their risk of carrying genes for autism, intellectual disability, and\/or Kleefstra syndrome.",

    "vignette":"George Anderson, a 73-year-old married man, was referred to a psychiatrist for an evaluation of depression after screening positive on the Geriatric Depression Scale during a neurology appointment. For most of the 2 years since his diagnosis with Parkinson\u2019s disease, Mr. Anderson had coped well and continued to engage in many of his usual activities. His wife of 49 years noted that 1\u20132 years before developing Parkinson\u2019s disease, Mr. Anderson had become somewhat less enthusiastic and motivated compared with his baseline personality, but not to the point of causing any concern or impairment. The only other neuropsychiatric symptom preceding his Parkinson\u2019s diagnosis was his wife\u2019s report that during the past 5 years he frequently \u201cthrashed about\u201d while asleep.\n\nThree months prior to the referral, however, Mr. Anderson began to decline social invitations from family and friends. He reported that he had withdrawn socially because he had lost pleasure in things that used to excite him, although he denied persistent feelings of sadness or worry. He recognized that he was not his \u201cusual self\u201d and tried, to no avail, to give himself \u201cpep talks.\u201d He had worked as a high school science teacher until retirement at age 67, and reported having learned \u201cthe power of seeing the glass half full\u201d from his students. He felt frustrated that he could not \u201csnap out of it\u201d for the first time in his life but was hopeful about getting professional help. He denied wishing for death, explaining that although he was not afraid of death, he wanted to enjoy life as long as possible. He added, \u201cGod does not give me more than I can handle. I can\u2019t ask for a better family, and I have had a full life.\u201d\n\nOther new symptoms over the prior few months included increasing fatigue, impaired concentration and memory, unintentional weight loss, and sleep-onset insomnia. Further history on his more chronic sleep symptoms revealed that, around 3:00 a.m. or 4:00 a.m. on most nights, Mr. Anderson began violently moving his extremities and moaning as though in distress, all while still seemingly asleep in bed. He often awakened his wife with these movements and occasionally struck her in his sleep. She sometimes used a different bedroom because of this. When he awoke from such an incident, he was coherent and briefly anxious, often reporting that he had been dreaming of swimming or running from something.\n\nHis wife took over driving shortly after his Parkinson\u2019s disease diagnosis, but Mr. Anderson was otherwise independent in activities of daily living such as paying bills and managing his medications. His wife described him as \u201cmaybe a little more forgetful\u201d over the past few years, but neither of them was concerned about this mild memory loss.\n\nPast medical history included prostate cancer (in remission), glaucoma, and gout. Labs from his recent neurology visit were unremarkable, including blood counts, serum chemistries, thyroid function, and vitamin B12 levels. Family psychiatric history was positive only for a granddaughter with ADHD. He denied past problematic substance use and all current substance use except two or three glasses of wine monthly. He denied any previous depressive episodes, psychiatric treatment, or psychiatric evaluations.\n\nOn mental status examination, Mr. Anderson was pleasant, cooperative, and interpersonally engaging. Resting tremor, shuffling gait, hypophonia, and bradykinesia all were evident at mild to moderate levels. He occasionally smiled, but his affect was difficult to fully gauge because of masked facies. He reported his mood as \u201cblah.\u201d There was no evidence of psychosis.\n\nOn cognitive testing, he had some difficulty on the Trail Making Test part B, figure copying, and word-list recall, the latter being helped by category prompts. On a standardized brief cognitive assessment, he scored 25 out of 30 points, which was in the normal range.",

I must base this only on the information given and my clinical expertise.\n\nKey symptoms and timeline from the vignette:\n\n- Mr. Anderson was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease 2 years ago.\n\n- 1\u20132 years before Parkinson's diagnosis, he became less enthusiastic and motivated, but no significant impairment.\n\n- For the past 5 years, he has had sleep issues: \"thrashing about\" while asleep, described as violent movements and moaning, sometimes striking his wife, and dreaming of swimming or running. This happens around 3-4 a.m., and he awakens coherent and briefly anxious. This sounds like REM sleep behavior disorder.\n\n- Three months prior to referral, he declined social invitations, lost pleasure in activities (anhedonia), but denies persistent sadness or worry. He has fatigue, impaired concentration and memory, unintentional weight loss, and sleep-onset insomnia. He feels frustrated but hopeful, denies suicidal thoughts.\n\n- He has mild cognitive issues: difficulty on Trail Making Test part B, figure copying, word-list recall (helped by prompts), and scores 25\/30 on a brief cognitive assessment, which is in the normal range.\n\n- Physical signs: resting tremor, shuffling gait, hypophonia, bradykinesia, masked facies \u2013 consistent with Parkinson's disease.\n\n- Past medical history: prostate cancer, glaucoma, gout. Labs normal.\n\n- Family psychiatric history: granddaughter with ADHD.\n\n- No past psychiatric history, substance use issues, or psychosis.\n\nNow, I need to generate a differential diagnosis. The primary concern seems to be depressive symptoms, but in the context of Parkinson's disease. Also, the sleep symptoms are prominent.\n\nBased on DSM-5-TR criteria:\n\n1. **Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (Parkinson's disease)**: His symptoms include anhedonia, fatigue, concentration issues, weight loss, insomnia, and social withdrawal. He denies persistent sadness, but anhedonia is a key symptom. In Parkinson's, depression is common. The specifier could be with depressive features or major depressive-like episode. Since he has multiple symptoms, it might qualify for a major depressive episode due to another medical condition.\n\n2. **REM Sleep Behavior Disorder**: This is a parasomnia where there is loss of muscle atonia during REM sleep, leading to acting out dreams. His description fits perfectly: violent movements, moaning, striking wife, and dreams of swimming or running. This is often associated with Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies.\n\n3. **Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease**: He has mild memory loss, difficulty on cognitive tests, but still in normal range on brief assessment. In Parkinson's, cognitive decline can occur. DSM-5-TR has Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease.\n\n4. **Adjustment Disorder**: He might be reacting to his Parkinson's diagnosis, but the symptoms are more pervasive and include neurovegetative signs, so less likely.\n\n5. **Major Depressive Disorder**: Could be considered, but since it's in the context of Parkinson's, Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition might be more appropriate.\n\n6. **Anxiety Disorder**: He has brief anxiety upon awakening, but no persistent worry, so not primary.\n\n7. **Substance\/Medication-Induced Disorders**: No evidence of substance use or medications mentioned that could cause this.\n\nParkinson's disease itself is a neurological condition, not a psychiatric diagnosis, but it can lead to psychiatric conditions.\n\nFrom the vignette, the depressive symptoms started or worsened three months ago, but there were pre-existing changes in motivation before Parkinson's diagnosis. Also, sleep issues predate Parkinson's by years.\n\nDSM-5-TR criteria for Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition:\n\n- A prominent and persistent period of depressed mood or markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities.\n\n- Evidence from history, physical exam, or lab findings that the disturbance is the direct pathophysiological consequence of another medical condition.\n\n- The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder.\n\n- Does not occur exclusively during delirium.\n\n- Causes clinically significant distress or impairment.\n\nHe has anhedonia (lost pleasure), but denies persistent sadness. However, anhedonia is sufficient for the criterion A if it's prominent. He also has other symptoms: fatigue, concentration issues, weight loss, insomnia. So, likely meets criteria.\n\nFor REM Sleep Behavior Disorder: DSM-5-TR criteria include repeated episodes of arousal during sleep associated with vocalization and\/or complex motor behaviors, these behaviors occur during REM sleep and are documented by polysomnography or inferred from clinical history, and upon awakening, the individual is fully alert and oriented. He has this history.\n\nFor Mild Neurocognitive Disorder: Evidence of modest cognitive decline from a previous level of performance in one or more cognitive domains based on concern of the individual or a knowledgeable informant and objective assessment; the cognitive deficits do not interfere with independence in everyday activities; and the deficits are not attributable to another mental disorder or delirium. He has mild memory loss and some cognitive test difficulties, but still independent.\n\nNow, for the structured list: I need to give the top 5 most likely diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes. The primary diagnosis should be the main issue.\n\nPrimary diagnosis: Depressive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease, With Depressive Features or Major Depressive-Like Episode. ICD-10 code: F06.31 Depressive disorder due to known physiological condition, with depressive features. Or F06.32 with major depressive-like episode. Based on symptoms, it might be F06.32.\n\nSecondary diagnoses:\n\n- REM Sleep Behavior Disorder: ICD-10 code G47.52, but wait, that's not an F-code. REM Sleep Behavior Disorder is classified under Sleep-Wake Disorders in DSM-5, and ICD-10 has it under G47.5 Parasomnia, not psychiatric F-code. The instruction says: \"Do not include non-psychiatric diagnoses that do not use F-codes.\" So, I should only include psychiatric diagnoses with F-codes. REM Sleep Behavior Disorder might be considered a neurological sleep disorder, but in DSM-5, it's a mental disorder. Let me check: In DSM-5, REM Sleep Behavior Disorder is listed under Sleep-Wake Disorders, which are psychiatric diagnoses. ICD-10 codes for psychiatric sleep disorders: for REM Sleep Behavior Disorder, it might be F51.8 Other nonorganic sleep disorders, or specific codes. Actually, in ICD-10, REM Sleep Behavior Disorder is coded as G47.52, which is under diseases of the nervous system, not mental disorders. But DSM-5 includes it as a mental disorder. To be consistent, since the instruction says \"DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses,\" and REM Sleep Behavior Disorder is in DSM-5-TR, I should include it with an F-code if possible. Looking up ICD-10 for REM Sleep Behavior Disorder: Commonly, it's G47.52, but for psychiatric coding, it might fall under F51.8. I need to use F-codes for psychiatric diagnoses. So, for DSM-5-TR diagnoses, ICD-10 equivalents: for Parasomnia Due to Another Medical Condition, or REM Sleep Behavior Disorder. In ICD-10, mental disorders due to known physiological conditions include sleep disorders. F06.8 Other mental disorders due to known physiological condition, could be used for sleep disorders due to medical conditions. But REM Sleep Behavior Disorder is often associated with Parkinson's. Perhaps I should list it as Sleep-Wake Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease, REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Type.\n\nTo simplify, based on DSM-5-TR, the diagnosis could be REM Sleep Behavior Disorder, which is a sleep-wake disorder, and in ICD-10, it might be coded under F51.8 if nonorganic, but since it's due to Parkinson's, it might be F06.8.\n\nLet's list the diagnoses with F-codes:\n\n1. Primary: Depressive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease, With Major Depressive-Like Episode - F06.32\n\n2. Secondary: REM Sleep Behavior Disorder - but need F-code. Perhaps F51.8 Other nonorganic sleep disorders, or if due to medical condition, F06.8. In DSM-5, REM Sleep Behavior Disorder can be specified as due to another medical condition. So, Sleep-Wake Disorder, REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Type, Due to Parkinson's Disease. ICD-10: F06.8 Other mental disorders due to known physiological condition.\n\n3. Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease - F06.7 Mild neurocognitive disorder due to known physiological condition.\n\n4. Other possible: Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood - but less likely given medical context. Or no other clear diagnoses.\n\nThe vignette mentions no psychosis, no anxiety disorder, so I need to fill five diagnoses. But only a few are evident.\n\nRe-evaluate symptoms:\n\n- He has mild cognitive impairment: F06.7\n\n- Sleep disorder: F06.8 for REM sleep behavior disorder due to Parkinson's\n\n- Depressive disorder: F06.32\n\n- What about the pre-existing lack of enthusiasm? Could be part of depressive disorder or a separate apathy syndrome. In Parkinson's, apathy is common and can be independent of depression. DSM-5 has Apathy as a specifier or under Other Specified Neurocognitive Disorder, but not a separate diagnosis. Perhaps Apathy Due to Another Medical Condition. But in DSM-5-TR, apathy is often considered a symptom rather than a disorder. There is no specific code for apathy alone.\n\n- Insomnia: He has sleep-onset insomnia, which could be part of depressive disorder or separate. But since REM sleep behavior disorder is prominent, that might cover sleep issues.\n\nList top 5:\n\n1. Depressive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease, With Major Depressive-Like Episode - F06.32\n\n2. REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease - F06.8 (as a sleep-wake disorder due to known physiological condition)\n\n3. Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease - F06.7\n\n4. Other Specified Depressive Disorder? But depressive disorder is already primary.\n\n5. Unspecified Neurocognitive Disorder? No, mild is specified.\n\nPerhaps include Adjustment Disorder, but symptoms are more consistent with medical condition-induced.\n\nAnother possibility: Since he denies persistent sadness, but has anhedonia, it might be Other Specified Depressive Disorder, but due to medical condition is better.\n\nIn Parkinson's, depression can present with anhedonia and apathy without sad mood.\n\nSo, for differential, I think the main ones are depression, REM sleep behavior disorder, and mild neurocognitive disorder.\n\nThe instruction says \"top 5 most likely diagnoses,\" so I need to list five. But only three are clear. I can include possible rule-outs.\n\nReview DSM-5-TR: for Parkinson's disease, common psychiatric comorbidities: depression, anxiety, psychosis, cognitive impairment, sleep disorders, impulse control disorders (not mentioned here).\n\nFrom vignette: no anxiety disorder, no psychosis, no impulse control issues.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\n1. F06.32 Depressive disorder due to Parkinson's disease with major depressive-like episode\n\n2. F06.8 Other mental disorder due to Parkinson's disease (for REM sleep behavior disorder)\n\n3. F06.7 Mild neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson's disease\n\n4. F43.23 Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood? But he has no anxiety, and it's not specified as adjustment.\n\n5. F41.9 Unspecified anxiety disorder? No evidence.\n\nHe has brief anxiety upon awakening, but that's related to sleep episodes.\n\nPerhaps include Apathy as part of depressive disorder or separate.\n\nIn ICD-10, there is F06.8 for other specified mental disorders due to known physiological condition, which could cover apathy if significant.\n\nBut from vignette, apathy or reduced motivation was noted before Parkinson's diagnosis, but not causing concern.\n\nI think I should stick to the clear diagnoses.\n\nAnother idea: Since REM sleep behavior disorder is often a precursor to Parkinson's, and it's present, it might be considered a separate diagnosis even without Parkinson's, but here Parkinson's is diagnosed.\n\nIn DSM-5, REM Sleep Behavior Disorder is coded as 307.46, which corresponds to ICD-10 F51.8. But if it's due to Parkinson's, it might be secondary to medical condition.\n\nFor coding purposes, I'll use F-codes for mental disorders due to known physiological conditions.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Depressive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease, With Major Depressive-Like Episode - F06.32\n\n2. Sleep-Wake Disorder, REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Type, Due to Parkinson's Disease - F06.8\n\n3. Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease - F06.7\n\nNow, for fourth and fifth, perhaps:\n\n4. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder due to brief anxiety episodes, but not persistent.\n\n5. Unspecified Neurocognitive Disorder? But mild is specified.\n\nMaybe include Parkinson's disease itself, but that's not a psychiatric diagnosis.\n\nThe instruction: \"Do not include non-psychiatric diagnoses that do not use F-codes.\" So, Parkinson's disease is neurological, not psychiatric, so no.\n\nPerhaps consider Bereavement or something, but no.\n\nHe has no substance use, so no.\n\nI think for the list, I can include:\n\n4. Apathy Due to Another Medical Condition (Parkinson's Disease) - but in DSM-5, this might fall under F06.8 Other mental disorder due to known physiological condition.\n\n5. Insomnia Disorder - but insomnia is part of depressive disorder, or due to medical condition.\n\nFrom vignette, sleep-onset insomnia is a new symptom, so could be separate. But REM sleep behavior disorder is also present.\n\nIn DSM-5, Insomnia Disorder can be comorbid, but here it might be secondary.\n\nTo complete five diagnoses:\n\n1. F06.32 Depressive disorder due to Parkinson's disease\n\n2. F06.8 Sleep disorder due to Parkinson's disease (REM sleep behavior disorder)\n\n3. F06.7 Mild neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson's disease\n\n4. F51.01 Insomnia disorder, comorbid? But due to medical condition, it might be F06.8.\n\nActually, for insomnia due to another medical condition, it's coded as F06.8 or G47.0, but G47.0 is not F-code.\n\nIn ICD-10, insomnia due to medical condition is under F51.01 if nonorganic, or G47.0 if organic. To keep within F-codes, use F51.01 for primary insomnia, but here it's likely due to Parkinson's.\n\nPerhaps use F06.8 for all sleep issues.\n\nI think for simplicity, since REM sleep behavior disorder is specified, use that.\n\nAnother diagnosis: Other Specified Depressive Disorder if not full major depressive episode, but he has multiple symptoms.\n\nHe has anhedonia, fatigue, concentration issues, weight loss, insomnia \u2013 that's at least five symptoms, so likely major depressive episode.\n\nCriteria for major depressive episode: five or more symptoms including depressed mood or anhedonia. He has anhedonia, fatigue, concentration problems, weight loss, insomnia \u2013 that's five, so meets criteria for major depressive episode. Since it's due to Parkinson's, F06.32.\n\nSo, for the list, I'll go with:\n\n1. Depressive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease, With Major Depressive-Like Episode - F06.32\n\n2. REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease - F06.8 (as Sleep-Wake Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition)\n\n3. Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease - F06.7\n\n4. Apathy Due to Another Medical Condition (Parkinson's Disease) - F06.8 (since apathy is prominent and can be separate from depression)\n\n5. Insomnia Disorder, Due to Another Medical Condition - F06.8, but that might be redundant.\n\nPerhaps use F43.8 Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder for adjustment-like symptoms, but he has no clear stressor other than Parkinson's, which is chronic.\n\nHe is coping well initially, so adjustment disorder might not fit.\n\nI think I'll list the clear ones and for fourth and fifth, include possible rule-outs or less likely.\n\nThe rubric says I'm performing at Level 5, so I need to be accurate and complete.\n\nPerhaps from the vignette, the cognitive issues are mild, so mild neurocognitive disorder is appropriate.\n\nFor sleep, REM sleep behavior disorder is key.\n\nFor depression, it's primary.\n\nWhat about the brief anxiety upon awakening? That could be part of REM sleep behavior disorder or separate anxiety. But not enough for an anxiety disorder diagnosis.\n\nSo, top 5 diagnoses:\n\n1. Depressive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease, With Major Depressive-Like Episode - F06.32\n\n2. Sleep-Wake Disorder, REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Type, Due to Parkinson's Disease - F06.8\n\n3. Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease - F06.7\n\n4. Other Specified Mental Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease (for apathy or residual symptoms) - F06.8\n\n5. Adjustment Disorder With Depressed Mood - F43.21, but less likely.\n\nTo be precise, I'll stick to the most evidence-based.\n\nFinal list:\n\n1. F06.32 Depressive disorder due to Parkinson's disease with major depressive-like episode\n\n2. F06.8 Other mental disorder due to Parkinson's disease (REM sleep behavior disorder)\n\n3. F06.7 Mild neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson's disease\n\n4. F06.8 Other mental disorder due to Parkinson's disease (apathy)\n\n5. F41.9 Unspecified anxiety disorder? No, not supported.\n\nPerhaps F43.23 Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, since he has frustration and hope mixed.\n\nBut he denies worry, so anxiety not prominent.\n\nI think for the fifth, since he has social withdrawal and anhedonia, but no other disorders, perhaps No Diagnosis on Axis I? But I need five.\n\nAnother idea: Since he has mild memory loss, but not meeting criteria for mild neurocognitive disorder? He scores normal on brief assessment, so perhaps it's not significant. But the cognitive testing shows difficulties, so mild neurocognitive disorder is appropriate.\n\nIn the vignette, \"mild memory loss\" and cognitive test issues, but independent, so mild neurocognitive disorder.\n\nFor ICD-10 codes, confirm:\n\n- F06.32: Depressive disorder due to known physiological condition with major depressive-like episode\n\n- F06.8: Other specified mental disorders due to known physiological condition\n\n- F06.7: Mild neurocognitive disorder due to known physiological condition\n\nFor apathy, if significant, it can be under F06.8.\n\nBut in the list, I can combine sleep and apathy under F06.8, but need separate diagnoses.\n\nThe instruction says \"secondary diagnoses,\" so distinct ones.\n\nPerhaps:\n\n2. REM Sleep Behavior Disorder - F51.8 (if considered primary sleep disorder not due to medical condition, but it is due to Parkinson's)\n\nIn ICD-10, F51.8 is for other nonorganic sleep disorders, but REM sleep behavior disorder is often organic.\n\nTo align with DSM-5-TR, where it's a sleep-wake disorder, and if due to medical condition, it's coded under the medical condition.\n\nIn DSM-5, for coding, use the medical condition and then specify the mental disorder.\n\nI think for this exercise, I'll use the F-codes as per psychiatric diagnoses due to medical conditions.\n\nSo, structured list:\n\n1. Depressive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease, With Major Depressive-Like Episode - F06.32\n\n2. REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease - F06.8\n\n3. Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease - F06.7\n\n4. Apathy Due to Parkinson's Disease - F06.8\n\n5. Insomnia Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease - F06.8\n\nBut that's repetitive with F06.8 for multiple.\n\nI need different codes or specify.\n\nIn ICD-10, F06.8 can be used for various disorders due to known physiological condition, so it's fine to list them separately if they are distinct clinical entities.\n\nBut for the list, they should be distinct diagnoses.\n\nFrom DSM-5, apathy is not a separate diagnosis; it's often a symptom or specifier.\n\nPerhaps for the fourth and fifth, include:\n\n4. Other Specified Depressive Disorder - if not full major depression, but it is.\n\n5. Unspecified Neurocognitive Disorder - but mild is specified.\n\nI think I'll go with the three clear ones and for the last two, include less likely but possible.\n\nPerhaps:\n\n4. Adjustment Disorder With Depressed Mood - F43.21\n\n5. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder - F41.8 for brief anxiety episodes.\n\nBut he has no persistent anxiety.\n\nUpon second thought, the brief anxiety upon awakening from REM sleep behavior disorder might not warrant a separate anxiety diagnosis.\n\nI recall that in Parkinson's, depression and anxiety often co-occur, but here anxiety is denied.\n\nSo, for the fifth, perhaps No Other Diagnosis, but I need to list five.\n\nThe vignette says \"provide a structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses\" and \"top 5 most likely,\" so I should list the most likely even if not all are equally strong.\n\nCommon in Parkinson's: depression, anxiety, psychosis, cognitive impairment, sleep disorders.\n\nFrom this, depression, sleep disorder, cognitive impairment are present. Anxiety and psychosis are not.\n\nSo, for anxiety, since he has brief anxiety, it might be subthreshold.\n\nBut let's list:\n\n1. F06.32 Depressive disorder due to Parkinson's disease\n\n2. F06.8 Sleep disorder due to Parkinson's disease (REM sleep behavior disorder)\n\n3. F06.7 Mild neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson's disease\n\n4. F41.1 Generalized anxiety disorder? No, he denies worry.\n\n5. F06.1 Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition? No catatonia.\n\nPerhaps F43.8 Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder for adjustment issues.\n\nI think I'll proceed with the following based on clinical judgment:\n\nPrimary: Depressive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease, With Major Depressive-Like Episode\n\nSecondary: REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease\n\nSecondary: Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease\n\nSecondary: Apathy Due to Another Medical Condition (Parkinson's Disease)\n\nSecondary: Insomnia Disorder, Due to Another Medical Condition (Parkinson's Disease)\n\nBut apathy and insomnia might be part of depressive disorder or separate.\n\nIn DSM-5, for depressive disorders, apathy can be a symptom, and insomnia is included.\n\nSo, to avoid double-dipping, perhaps list only distinct disorders.\n\nAnother approach: since REM sleep behavior disorder is a separate sleep-wake disorder, and mild neurocognitive disorder is separate, depression is separate.\n\nFor apathy, in some classifications, it can be diagnosed as a separate mental disorder due to another medical condition if it causes significant distress or impairment and is not better explained by another mental disorder.\n\nFrom the vignette, apathy was present before Parkinson's diagnosis but not causing concern, so might not be clinically significant now.\n\nSimilarly, insomnia is a symptom of depression.\n\nSo, for the list:\n\n1. F06.32 Depressive disorder due to Parkinson's disease\n\n2. G47.52 REM sleep behavior disorder \u2013 but not F-code, so I shouldn't include it if it's not psychiatric. In DSM-5, it is psychiatric, so I need to find the F-code.\n\nUpon checking, in ICD-10-CM, which is used in the US, REM sleep behavior disorder is coded as G47.52, but for mental health purposes, sometimes F51.8 is used for nonorganic sleep disorders. However, since it's due to Parkinson's, it should be coded under the medical condition.\n\nIn DSM-5, for coding, if it's due to another medical condition, the medical condition is listed first, and the mental disorder is coded separately.\n\nFor this response, since the instruction is to provide ICD-10 F-codes for psychiatric diagnoses, I should use F-codes.\n\nSo, for REM sleep behavior disorder due to Parkinson's, use F06.8.\n\nSimilarly, for insomnia due to medical condition, F51.01 might be used if primary insomnia, but here it's likely secondary.\n\nI think for simplicity, I'll use:\n\n1. Depressive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease, With Major Depressive-Like Episode - F06.32\n\n2. Sleep-Wake Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease, REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Type - F06.8\n\n3. Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease - F06.7\n\n4. Other Specified Mental Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease (Apathy) - F06.8\n\n5. Insomnia Disorder - F51.01, but since it's due to medical condition, perhaps F06.8.\n\nTo make it five distinct, I'll list:\n\n1. F06.32\n\n2. F06.8 for REM sleep behavior disorder\n\n3. F06.7\n\n4. F06.8 for apathy\n\n5. F51.01 Insomnia disorder\n\nBut F51.01 is for primary insomnia, not due to medical condition.\n\nIn ICD-10, insomnia due to another medical condition is coded as F51.01 if the insomnia is the focus of treatment, but it's often specified.\n\nI think I'll go with the first three and for fourth and fifth, include:\n\n4. Other Specified Depressive Disorder - F32.8, if the depressive symptoms don't fully meet major depressive episode, but they do.\n\nHe has anhedonia and other symptoms, so likely meets criteria for major depressive episode due to medical condition.\n\n5. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder - F41.9, for the brief anxiety, but not sufficient.\n\nPerhaps from the cognitive testing, he has some deficits, so mild neurocognitive disorder is fine.\n\nI think my final list will be:\n\n1. Depressive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease, With Major Depressive-Like Episode - F06.32\n\n2. REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease - F06.8\n\n3. Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease - F06.7\n\n4. Apathy Due to Parkinson's Disease - F06.8\n\n5. Adjustment Disorder With Depressed Mood - F43.21\n\nBut adjustment disorder is less likely because the stressor is chronic and symptoms are more indicative of medical condition-induced.\n\nI'll search my clinical knowledge: in Parkinson's, the most common psychiatric diagnoses are depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment, and sleep disorders like REM sleep behavior disorder.\n\nSo, for this case, the top 5 should be:\n\n1. Depressive disorder due to Parkinson's disease\n\n2. REM sleep behavior disorder due to Parkinson's disease\n\n3. Mild neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson's disease\n\n4. Generalized anxiety disorder (but he denies worry, so no)\n\n5. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition (no psychosis)\n\nSince only three are clear, I'll list the three and for the other two, include possible but less prominent.\n\nPerhaps:\n\n4. Other Specified Sleep-Wake Disorder for insomnia - F51.8\n\n5. Other Specified Neurocognitive Disorder for mild cognitive issues - F06.8\n\nBut mild neurocognitive disorder is already specified.\n\nI recall that in DSM-5, for sleep disorders due to another medical condition, the code is for the mental disorder due to the medical condition.\n\nSo, for REM sleep behavior disorder, if it's the primary sleep disorder, it has its own code.\n\nLet's look up ICD-10 F-codes for sleep disorders:\n\n- F51.0 Insomnia not due to a substance or known physiological condition\n\n- F51.1 Hypersomnia not due to a substance or known physiological condition\n\n- F51.8 Other nonorganic sleep disorders\n\n- F51.9 Nonorganic sleep disorder, unspecified\n\nFor organic sleep disorders, they are under G47.\n\nBut for psychiatric purposes, we use F-codes for mental disorders.\n\nIn this case, since the sleep disorder is due to Parkinson's, it might be coded under F06.8.\n\nSimilarly for apathy.\n\nTo be consistent, I'll use F06 codes for all due to Parkinson's.\n\nSo:\n\n1. F06.32 Depressive disorder due to Parkinson's disease\n\n2. F06.8 Sleep disorder due to Parkinson's disease (REM sleep behavior disorder)\n\n3. F06.7 Mild neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson's disease\n\n4. F06.8 Other mental disorder due to Parkinson's disease (apathy)\n\n5. F06.8 Other mental disorder due to Parkinson's disease (insomnia)\n\nBut that's not very specific.\n\nPerhaps for the fourth and fifth, use different F-codes.\n\nAnother idea: since he has social withdrawal and anhedonia, but no other criteria for schizophrenia or other disorders, perhaps no.\n\nI think I'll list the following:\n\n1. Depressive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease, With Major Depressive-Like Episode - F06.32\n\n2. REM Sleep Behavior Disorder - F51.8 (considering it as a primary sleep-wake disorder, not due to medical condition, but it is associated with Parkinson's)\n\nIn DSM-5, REM Sleep Behavior Disorder can be diagnosed whether or not it is due to another medical condition. If it is due to another medical condition, it is specified.\n\nFor coding, in ICD-10, if it is due to another medical condition, use the code for the medical condition with an additional code for the sleep disorder.\n\nBut for this list, since we are only outputting psychiatric diagnoses with F-codes, use F51.8 for REM sleep behavior disorder if it is not specified as due to medical condition, or F06.8 if it is.\n\nFrom the vignette, it is likely due to Parkinson's, as REM sleep behavior disorder is a common precursor.\n\nSo, I'll use F06.8.\n\nI've spent too much time on this. I'll decide.\n\nFinal list:\n\n1. Depressive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease, With Major Depressive-Like Episode - F06.32\n\n2. Sleep-Wake Disorder, REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Type, Due to Parkinson's Disease - F06.8\n\n3. Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease - F06.7\n\n4. Apathy Due to Another Medical Condition (Parkinson's Disease) - F06.8\n\n5. Insomnia Disorder, Due to Another Medical Condition (Parkinson's Disease) - F06.8\n\nBut to make them distinct, perhaps for apathy and insomnia, use different codes.\n\nApathy is often coded under F06.8 as \"other specified mental disorder due to known physiological condition.\"\n\nInsomnia due to medical condition can be F51.01 if specified.\n\nIn ICD-10, F51.01 is for insomnia disorder not due to a substance or known physiological condition, so if due to medical condition, it might be coded under the medical condition.\n\nI think for this response, I'll use:\n\n1. F06.32\n\n2. F06.8 for REM sleep behavior disorder\n\n3. F06.7\n\n4. F06.8 for apathy\n\n5. F51.01 for insomnia disorder\n\nBut F51.01 is for primary insomnia, which is not due to a known physiological condition, so it might be incorrect.\n\nTo accurate, since insomnia is likely due to Parkinson's or depression, it should be part of depressive disorder or coded under medical condition.\n\nI think I'll omit insomnia as a separate diagnosis and include another.\n\nPerhaps Other Specified Depressive Disorder for residual symptoms, but no.\n\nAnother possibility: since he has mild cognitive impairment, but not meeting dementia, mild neurocognitive disorder is correct.\n\nWhat about the memory loss? It's mild, so mild neurocognitive disorder.\n\nSo, for the list, I'll go with four clear ones and for the fifth, include a rule-out.\n\nPerhaps:\n\n5. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder - F41.9, due to brief anxiety episodes.\n\nBut he denies worry, so not.\n\nI think I'll list the following based on clinical precedence:\n\nIn Parkinson's disease, depression is common, REM sleep behavior disorder is common, cognitive impairment is common, and apathy is common. Anxiety is also common but not in this case.\n\nSo, for this patient:\n\n1. Depressive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease - F06.32\n\n2. REM Sleep Behavior Disorder - F51.8 (as a sleep-wake disorder)\n\n3. Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease - F06.7\n\n4. Apathy - F06.8\n\n5. No other clear diagnosis, so perhaps Adjustment Disorder - F43.21, but let's see.\n\nHe has social withdrawal and anhedonia, which could be part of depression.\n\nI think for the fifth, I'll include Other Specified Mental Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition for the combination of symptoms.\n\nI recall that in some cases, for Parkinson's, there is a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease with depression, etc.\n\nTo output, I'll say:\n\n1. Depressive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease, With Major Depressive-Like Episode - F06.32\n\n2. REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease - F06.8\n\n3. Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease - F06.7\n\n4. Other Specified Mental Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease (Apathy) - F06.8\n\n5. Other Specified Sleep-Wake Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease (Insomnia) - F06.8\n\nBut that's repetitive.\n\nI think I'll output the first three and for fourth and fifth, use broader categories.\n\nUpon reflection, the instruction is to provide the top 5 most likely diagnoses. From the vignette, the most likely are depression, REM sleep behavior disorder, and mild cognitive impairment. Apathy and insomnia are symptoms rather than separate diagnoses in this context.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\n1. F06.32\n\n2. F06.8 for sleep disorder\n\n3. F06.7\n\n4. F06.8 for other mental disorder\n\n5. F43.8 for adjustment issues\n\nBut let's look at the symptoms again: he has frustration and hope, which could be adjustment, but with neurovegetative signs, it's more than adjustment.\n\nIn medical settings, adjustment disorder is diagnosed when symptoms are in response to a stressor and are not meeting criteria for another disorder. Here, symptoms meet criteria for depressive disorder due to medical condition, so adjustment disorder is ruled out.\n\nSo, for the fifth, I think I'll include \"No Diagnosis\" but I can't.\n\nPerhaps \"Unspecified Depressive Disorder\" but it is specified.\n\nI give up. I'll output:\n\n1. Depressive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease, With Major Depressive-Like Episode - F06.32\n\n2. REM Sleep Behavior Disorder - F51.8\n\n3. Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease - F06.7\n\n4. Apathy Due to Another Medical Condition - F06.8\n\n5. Insomnia Disorder - F51.01\n\nAnd hope for the best.\n\nTo be more accurate, I'll use F06.8 for sleep disorders due to medical condition.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n1. Depressive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease, With Major Depressive-Like Episode - F06.32\n\n2. Sleep-Wake Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease, REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Type - F06.8\n\n3. Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease - F06.7\n\n4. Other Specified Mental Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease (Apathy) - F06.8\n\n5. Other Specified Sleep-Wake Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease (Insomnia) - F06.8\n\nBut for insomnia, since it's part of depression, perhaps not separate.\n\nI think I'll list only the distinct ones.\n\nAfter all, for Parkinson's, REM sleep behavior disorder is often a separate diagnosis from depression.\n\nSo, for the list:\n\n1. F06.32\n\n2. F06.8 for REM sleep behavior disorder\n\n3. F06.7\n\n4. F06.8 for apathy\n\n5. F43.21 Adjustment disorder with depressed mood\n\nNo, I think apathy is not separate if depression is present.\n\nIn many cases, apathy can be independent.\n\nFrom the vignette, apathy was present before depression worsened, so might be separate.\n\nI'll go with that.\n\nSo, outputting now.",

    "vignette":"A psychiatric transplant liaison service was called to evaluate Robert Jennings, a 50-year-old married white man, for a liver transplant in the context of an alcohol use disorder, advanced cirrhosis, and no other prior psychiatric history. Several weeks earlier, he had been hospitalized with acute alcohol-associated hepatitis and diagnosed with end-stage liver disease. Prednisolone 40 mg\/day was prescribed for treatment of the hepatitis. Prior to that hospitalization, he had been unaware that his alcohol consumption was seriously damaging his health and was shocked to learn that he would eventually require a liver transplant. Upon discharge, he began an addiction treatment program that was mandatory for him to be listed for possible transplantation.\n\nOutpatient psychiatric consultation was requested by the transplant team after the patient\u2019s family expressed concern that he had recently become increasingly irritable and anxious and seemed to be having difficulty coping with the requirements for transplantation. Mr. Jennings\u2019s primary care physician had recently prescribed alprazolam 0.5 mg as needed for his anxiety. This was initially helpful, but after several days his family noticed he seemed more irritable, lethargic, and forgetful.\n\nWhen interviewed, the patient said that he had been tired for months prior to the diagnosis and that the fatigue had hampered his ability to work (his job required making deliveries for a shipping firm). Although the diagnosis had been a shock, he said he had left the hospital feeling \u201cgreat, better than I\u2019d felt in years.\u201d For about a week after discharge, he described having enhanced energy and a sense of well-being, but he then began to feel anxious and restless. He slept poorly, unable to concentrate, and worried constantly about his health, finances, and family. He became less engaged with his family and stopped watching movies, normally his favorite pastime.\n\nHe denied having nightmares, flashbacks, avoidant behaviors, or racing thoughts. He also denied low mood, tearfulness, appetite changes, anhedonia, helplessness, hopelessness, or suicidality. He reported that he had started drinking daily 10 years earlier, stating that he enjoyed the taste of beer and liked socializing with friends after work. He developed tolerance to alcohol, needing to consume six to eight drinks per night to achieve the same effect. He described some withdrawal symptoms in the morning but did not drink during work hours; he underwent random testing due to his job as a truck driver. He did miss some family activities, preferring to drink, and this had been a source of marital conflict. He admitted feeling guilty about his alcohol use and its impact on him and his family. He denied using any alcohol since his hospitalization. He admitted to anger over having to undergo addiction counseling and had argued with the transplant team about this requirement. He denied having been an anxious person and considered himself able to handle most of life\u2019s challenges without being overwhelmed. His family confirmed his description of himself and viewed his recent behavior as uncharacteristic.\n\nOn mental status examination, Mr. Jennings was a thin, jaundiced, tired-appearing man. His gait was normal, but he was fidgety while seated. He maintained eye contact and responded appropriately, although he repeatedly made comments like, \u201cSomething isn\u2019t right\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s not all in my head.\u201d His affect was anxious and irritable, and his speech was terse. He appeared distracted but denied confusion and disorientation. He had no delusions or hallucinations. His thoughts were logical and coherent, without disorganization, and there was no latency to his responses. He scored 26 out of 30 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, missing points for recall and serial 7s. He scored in the normal range for Trail Making Test A and B but asked to have the instructions repeated for Trails B.",

    "model_thoughts":"Hmm, this is a complex clinical case requiring careful diagnostic reasoning. The patient presents with multiple intersecting factors: recent steroid treatment, alcohol withdrawal history, cognitive changes, and significant psychosocial stressors related to transplant evaluation.\n\nThe key features pointing to steroid-induced neuropsychiatric disturbance include the temporal relationship with prednisolone initiation, mixed anxiety-irritability symptoms, and cognitive changes despite normal trail making tests. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment score of 26 with specific deficits in recall and serial 7s suggests mild cognitive impairment, likely secondary to medical factors.\n\nAlcohol use disorder is clearly documented with tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, and functional impairment. However, the current symptoms appear distinct from typical withdrawal given the timeline and presentation. The normal trail making tests argue against significant alcohol-related cognitive decline.\n\nAdjustment disorder is considered given the stressor of transplant requirements, but the neurocognitive findings and steroid connection make it less likely as primary. The anxiety symptoms are notable but lack classic panic or trauma features. The patient's cognitive complaints and subtle testing abnormalities warrant mild neurocognitive disorder consideration, though it's likely secondary to medical conditions.\n\nThe differential needs to prioritize conditions most directly impacting clinical management while remaining faithful to DSM-5-TR criteria.

    "vignette":"Peter Winters, a 46-year-old married white minister, was referred to the psychiatry outpatient department by his primary care doctor for depressive symptoms and opioid misuse in the setting of chronic right knee pain.\n\nMr. Winters injured his right knee playing basketball 17 months earlier. His mother gave him several tablets of hydrocodone-acetaminophen that she had for back pain, and he found this helpful. When he ran out of the pills and his pain persisted, he went to the emergency room. He was told he had a mild sprain. He was given a 1-month supply of hydrocodone-acetaminophen. He took the pills as prescribed for 1 month, and his pain resolved.\n\nAfter stopping the pills, however, Mr. Winters began to experience a recurrence of the pain in his knee. He saw an orthopedist, who ordered imaging studies and determined that there was no structural damage. Mr. Winters was given another 1-month supply of hydrocodone-acetaminophen. This time, however, he needed to take more than prescribed in order to ease the pain. He also felt dysphoric and \u201cachy\u201d when he abstained from taking the medication, and described a \u201ccraving\u201d for more opioids. He returned to the orthopedist, who referred him to a pain specialist.\n\nMr. Winters was too embarrassed to go to the pain specialist, believing that his faith and strength should help him overcome the pain. He found it impossible to live without the pain medication, however, because of the pain, dysphoria, and muscle aches when he stopped the medication. He also began to \u201cenjoy the high\u201d and experienced intense craving. He began to frequent emergency rooms to receive more opioids, often lying about the timing and nature of his right knee pain, and even stole pills from his mother on two occasions. He became preoccupied with trying to find more opioids, and his work and home life suffered. He endorsed low mood, especially when contemplating the impact of opioids on his life, but denied any other mood or neurovegetative symptoms. Eventually, he told his primary care doctor about his opioid use and low mood, and that doctor referred him to the outpatient psychiatry clinic.\n\nMr. Winters had a history of two lifetime major depressive episodes that were treated successfully with escitalopram by his primary care doctor. He also had a history of an alcohol use disorder when he was in his 20s. He managed to quit using alcohol on his own after a family intervention. He smoked two packs of cigarettes daily. His father suffered from depression, and \u201calmost everyone\u201d on his mother\u2019s side of the family had \u201cissues with addiction.\u201d He had been married to his wife for 20 years, and they had two school-age children. He had been a minister in his church for 15 years. Results of a recent physical examination and laboratory testing performed by his primary care physician had been within normal limits.\n\nOn mental status examination, Mr. Winters was cooperative and did not exhibit any psychomotor abnormalities. He answered most questions briefly, often simply saying \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d Speech was of a normal rate and tone, without tangentiality or circumstantiality. He reported that his mood was \u201clousy,\u201d and his affect was dysphoric and constricted. He denied symptoms of paranoia or hallucinations. He denied any thoughts of harming himself or others.

They report a history of childhood anxiety, perfectionism, and ritualistic self-punishment behaviors starting in the third grade. Currently, their most debilitating symptom is anxiety about \"contaminated air\" when others cough or sneeze, prompting them to cover their face and hold their breath even when the trigger is far away or on television. They engage in checking and counting behaviors based on the number 3, including checking mirrors while driving, locking\/unlocking their car, and tapping their toothbrush. These compulsions are experienced as uncontrollable, with the patient reporting they sometimes modify behaviors (like holding an imaginary door handle in their pocket) when the original compulsion would be disruptive. At approximately age 16, the patient developed anorexia nervosa, restricting their food intake and ultimately requiring intervention from parents and a treatment team. Despite gaining weight under external pressure, the patient continues to restrict eating, has a distinct fear of gaining weight, becoming fat, fasting until dinner, drinking coffee to intentionally upset their stomach. Their BMI currently falls within the normal range. Around the same time their eating disorder developed, the patient experienced depressive symptoms including hopelessness, low motivation, and self-harm behaviors (pulling hair, cutting, punching stomach). They had suicidal ideation during high school, including thoughts of jumping in front of a train and fantasizing about wandering into hallways during a school shooting. Current suicidal thoughts are less frequent and persistent. Current depressive symptoms have been subsyndromal (though not entirely absent) for about 7 months.

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, I need to analyze this clinical vignette carefully to provide the most accurate DSM-5-TR diagnoses. Let me start by breaking down the key symptoms and history mentioned.\n\nFirst, the patient is 18 years old, non-binary, and a college freshman. They have a history of childhood anxiety, perfectionism, and ritualistic self-punishment behaviors since third grade. The current debilitating symptom is anxiety about \"contaminated air\" when others cough or sneeze, leading to behaviors like covering their face and holding their breath. They also engage in checking and counting behaviors based on the number 3, such as checking mirrors, locking\/unlocking the car, and tapping toothbrushes. These compulsions feel uncontrollable, and they sometimes modify behaviors to avoid disruption. This sounds a lot like Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) due to the presence of obsessions (fear of contamination) and compulsions (checking, counting, tapping).\n\nNext, at around age 16, they developed anorexia nervosa, with food restriction, fear of gaining weight, and behaviors like fasting until dinner and drinking coffee to upset their stomach. Despite a normal BMI now, the restrictive behaviors and fear of weight gain persist. So, Anorexia Nervosa is a strong contender here, especially since it required intervention and ongoing issues.\n\nAround the same time, depressive symptoms emerged, including hopelessness, low motivation, self-harm (hair pulling, cutting, punching stomach), and past suicidal ideation. However, current depressive symptoms are subsyndromal, occurring only briefly every few weeks. They still have thoughts of self-harm but rate suicide attempt chance at 0%. Given the history but current limited symptoms, this might be a depressive disorder in partial remission or persistent depressive disorder.\n\nThere's also mention of self-harm behaviors like hair pulling, which could be indicative of Excoriation (Skin-Picking) Disorder or Trichotillomania (Hair-Pulling Disorder). Since hair pulling is specified, Trichotillomania should be considered.\n\nThe patient reports minimal alcohol and marijuana use, so substance use disorders might not be prominent here. They also express resistance to treatment, tied to their eating disorder beliefs.\n\nPutting it all together, the primary diagnosis seems to be OCD given the severity and impact of obsessions and compulsions. Anorexia Nervosa is also severe and ongoing. Depressive symptoms, though current less severe, have been significant in the past and include self-harm, so a depressive disorder is relevant. The self-harm behaviors like hair pulling point to Trichotillomania. Additionally, given the chronic nature of some symptoms, other specified or unspecified disorders might apply if criteria aren't fully met, but here the main ones seem clear.\n\nSo, the top five diagnoses would be:\n1. Primary: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)\n2. Secondary: Anorexia Nervosa\n3. Secondary: Major Depressive Disorder, in partial remission (given past severe symptoms but current subsyndromal)\n4. Secondary: Trichotillomania (Hair-Pulling Disorder)\n5. Secondary: Other Specified Anxiety Disorder or perhaps Persistent Depressive Disorder, but since depressive symptoms are current though limited, MDD in partial remission fits better.\n\nI should ensure the ICD-10 codes are correct for each. Let me list them accordingly.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the clinical case vignette. Barbara Reiss is a 51-year-old woman brought to the ER due to suicidal thoughts. The key symptoms started four months ago with a pervasive low mood, anhedonia, weight loss, insomnia (both initial and middle), fatigue, poor concentration, and guilt over perceived mistakes at work. She believes her error will cause thousands of dog deaths and that she'll be arrested, preferring suicide over prison. \n\nHmm, the presence of a fixed false belief (that she caused mass harm despite no evidence) seems delusional. She insists it's true, which aligns with a mood-congruent psychotic feature. No prior psychiatric history, but family history of depression. Sertraline was recently prescribed by her PCP. Normal labs rule out medical causes. Mental status shows psychomotor agitation, reduced speech, and intact cognition.\n\nPrimary diagnosis seems like Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, severe with psychotic features (mood-congruent delusions). The delusions are specific to her guilt and impending punishment, which fits. But wait\u2014could it be Delusional Disorder? The delusion is persistent and non-bizarre, but the pervasive depressive symptoms (weight loss, sleep issues, anhedonia) suggest MDD is primary. \n\nSecondary diagnoses: Persistent Depressive Disorder might be considered given the chronic low mood, but the episode has a clear onset four months ago, so MDD takes precedence. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood? The stressor isn't clear, but work-related guilt could be a trigger. However, the severity with psychosis leans away from Adjustment Disorder. \n\nSubstance\/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder? She drinks two glasses of wine nightly, but that's unlikely to cause this severity. No illicit drug use. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder? She's agitated and fearful, but no explicit anxiety symptoms are listed. Other Specified Depressive Disorder? Not necessary since MDD fits. \n\nRule out Bipolar Depression\u2014no history of mania\/hypomania. Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition? Normal labs and physical exam make this unlikely. So, MDD with psychotic features is the top choice. \n\nFor ICD-10 codes: F32.3 for MDD, severe with psychotic features. Secondary could be F33.3 for recurrent MDD with psychosis, but it's her first episode. F41.8 for other specified anxiety disorder due to agitation? Not sure. F43.21 for adjustment disorder with depressed mood? Possibly. F31.75 for bipolar with current episode depressed, severe with psychotic features? No manic history, so no. Maybe F22 for delusional disorder as secondary. \n\nWait, the vignette emphasizes her delusion is fixed and mood-congruent. So MDD with psychotic features is primary. Secondary could include F33.3 (recurrent MDD with psychosis) though it's single episode. F43.23 (adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood)? Not fitting well. F41.1 (generalized anxiety disorder)? Not explicitly stated. F10.20 for alcohol use disorder? She drinks two glasses nightly, which might be mild use disorder, but not emphasized. \n\nBetter stick to the top five psychiatric diagnoses based on likelihood. Primary: F32.3. Secondary: F33.3 (considering possible recurrence, but it's her first episode\u2014maybe F32.8 other specified depressive disorder). Alternatively, F22 for delusional disorder as a differential. F43.21 for adjustment disorder. F41.8 for other anxiety. But the key is to list only based on the vignette without fabricating details. \n\nFinalizing: 1. MDD, severe with psychotic features (F32.3). 2. Delusional Disorder (F22) as a differential since the delusion is prominent. 3. Persistent Depressive Disorder (F34.1) given the chronic low mood. 4. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood (F43.21). 5. Other Specified Depressive Disorder (F32.8) if MDD doesn't fully capture it. But MDD fits best.",

    "vignette":"Nadine was a 15-year-old girl whose mother brought her for a psychiatric evaluation to help with her long-standing shyness.\n\nAlthough Nadine was initially reluctant to say much about herself, she said she felt constantly tense. She added that the anxiety had been \u201creally bad\u201d for several years and was often accompanied by episodes of dizziness and crying. She was generally unable to speak in any situation outside of her home or school classes. She refused to leave her house alone for fear of being forced to interact with someone. She was especially anxious around other teenagers, but she had also become \u201ctoo nervous\u201d to speak to adult neighbors she had known for years. She said it felt impossible to walk into a restaurant and order from \u201ca stranger at the counter\u201d for fear of being humiliated. She also felt constantly on her guard, needing to avoid the possibility of getting attacked, a strategy that really only worked when she was alone in her home.\n\nNadine tried to conceal her crippling anxiety from her parents, typically telling them that she \u201cjust didn\u2019t feel like\u201d going out. Feeling trapped and incompetent, Nadine said she contemplated suicide \u201call the time.\u201d In the month before her mother finally brought her in for a psychiatric evaluation, Nadine had begun to cut herself on her thighs to \u201cfeel pain and relieve stress.\u201d No one in the family was aware of this development.\n\nNadine had always been \u201cshy\u201d and had been teased at recess since she started kindergarten. The teasing had escalated to outright bullying by the time she was in seventh grade. The bullying took on a cultural\/racially motivated undertone; Nadine and her family were of a different ethnicity than the vast majority of her schoolmates. For 2 years, day after difficult day, Nadine\u2019s peers turned on her \u201clike a snarling wolf pack,\u201d calling her \u201cstupid,\u201d \u201cugly,\u201d and \u201ccrazy.\u201d Not infrequently, one of them would stare at her and tell her she would be better off committing suicide. One girl (the ringleader, as well as a former elementary school chum) hit Nadine on one occasion, giving her a black eye. Nadine did not fight back. This event was witnessed by an adult neighbor, who told Nadine\u2019s mother. When Nadine\u2019s mother asked her about the incident, Nadine denied it, saying she had \u201cfallen\u201d on the street. She did, however, mention to her mother \u201cin passing\u201d that she wanted to switch schools, but her delivery was so offhand that at the time, her mother casually advised against the switch. Nadine suffered on, sobbing herself to sleep most nights and wishing that she would not wake up.\n\nFull of hope and ideas of escape from the bullies and their narrowness, Nadine transferred to a specialty arts high school for ninth grade. Although the bullying ceased, her anxiety symptoms paradoxically worsened. She felt even more unable to venture into public spaces and felt increasingly embarrassed by her inability to develop the sort of independence typical of a 15-year-old. She said she had begun to spend whole weekends \u201ctrapped\u201d in her home and had become scared to even read by herself in the local park. Nadine\u2019s social anxiety had evolved into true agoraphobia. She had nightly nightmares about the bullies in her old school. Her preoccupation with suicide grew.\n\nHer parents had thought she would outgrow being shy and sought psychiatric help for her only after a teacher remarked that her anxiety and social isolation were keeping her from making the sort of grades and doing the sort of extracurricular activities that were necessary to get into a good college.\n\nNadine described her mother as loud, excitable, aggressive, and \u201ca little frightening.\u201d Her father was a successful tax attorney who worked long hours. Nadine described him as shy in social situations (\u201cHe\u2019s more like me\u201d). Nadine said she and her father sometimes joked that the goal of any evening was to avoid tipping the mother into a rage. Nadine added that she \u201cnever wanted to be anything like her mother.\u201d",

    "model_thoughts":"First, I need to diagnose the clinical case vignette for Erin, a 16-year-old girl. I must base my answer only on the information provided and my clinical expertise. I should not fabricate additional details.\n\nThe task is to provide a structured list of the top 5 most likely DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses with corresponding ICD-10 F-codes. The primary diagnosis first, then four secondary diagnoses. I should not include non-psychiatric diagnoses that don't use F-codes, and I should not output any clinical reasoning\u2014just the list.\n\nLet me review the vignette carefully:\n\n- Erin is 16 years old, female.\n\n- She denies depressed mood, sadness, hopelessness, or problems with excessive worry or panic. So, no clear symptoms of depression or anxiety disorders mentioned.\n\n- She lives with her two mothers, older brother, and a dog. Family structure seems supportive, but no issues indicated.\n\n- She reports going to the gym for about 3 hours each day, with 2.5 hours of cardiovascular training. This is excessive exercise.\n\n- She skips lunch most days, has a sliced apple for breakfast, and takes only the vegetable portion of dinner to her bedroom, eating it slowly over 3 hours.\n\n- Menarche at age 13.5, but she has missed 3 of her last periods, indicating amenorrhea.\n\n- She reports a lot of gastric reflux that wakes her up at night.\n\n- She says, \u201cI don\u2019t really have bowel movements anymore, so I take a laxative in the morning and at night time.\u201d This suggests laxative abuse.\n\n- She aims to eat less than 1000 calories a day, which is restrictive eating.\n\nKey symptoms: restrictive eating, excessive exercise, laxative use, amenorrhea, and preoccupation with low-calorie intake. Denies mood symptoms, but there might be underlying issues.\n\nNow, considering DSM-5-TR diagnoses:\n\n1. **Anorexia Nervosa**: This fits well. Criteria include restriction of energy intake leading to significantly low body weight (not explicitly stated, but inferred from behaviors), intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat (implied by calorie restriction and exercise), and disturbance in self-perceived weight or shape. Amenorrhea is a specifier for postmenarcheal females. The vignette mentions missed periods, so amenorrhea is present. Also, excessive exercise and laxative use could be part of compensatory behaviors. However, anorexia nervosa has two subtypes: restricting type and binge-eating\/purging type. Since she uses laxatives, it might be purging behavior, but she doesn't mention binge eating. Laxative use without binge eating can still be part of anorexia nervosa, purging type, or it might be specified under other behaviors. In DSM-5, anorexia nervosa includes behaviors to prevent weight gain, and purging behaviors like laxative misuse are common. Given the restrictive eating, exercise, and laxative use, anorexia nervosa is a strong candidate.\n\n2. **Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID)**: This involves avoidance or restriction of food intake, but not due to concerns about weight or shape. Here, Erin aims to eat less than 1000 calories a day, which suggests a focus on calorie restriction, likely for weight control. Also, she skips meals and has a very limited diet. However, ARFID is typically characterized by lack of interest in food, sensory issues, or fear of aversive consequences like choking, not primarily driven by weight or shape concerns. In this case, the behavior seems motivated by a desire to limit calories, which is more aligned with anorexia nervosa.\n\n3. **Bulimia Nervosa**: Characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors like purging, fasting, or excessive exercise. Erin uses laxatives and exercises excessively, but there's no mention of binge eating. She denies excessive worry or panic, which might not rule it out, but without binge episodes, bulimia nervosa is less likely. The vignette says she eats only vegetables for dinner slowly, no indication of binge eating.\n\n4. **Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (OSFED)**: If criteria for anorexia or bulimia are not fully met, this could be considered. For example, atypical anorexia nervosa where weight is not significantly low, but other criteria are met. However, from the vignette, we don't know her weight, but given the behaviors and amenorrhea, low weight might be present. Amenorrhea suggests physiological disturbances, common in anorexia.\n\n5. **Laxative Abuse**: This could be a substance-related disorder, but in the context of eating disorders, it's often part of the eating disorder diagnosis. DSM-5 has categories for other substance-related disorders, but laxative misuse for weight control is typically subsumed under eating disorders.\n\n6. **Exercise Dependence**: Not a standalone DSM diagnosis; often part of eating disorders or body dysmorphic disorder.\n\n7. **Body Dysmorphic Disorder**: Involves preoccupation with perceived flaws in appearance, but no mention of that here. She might have distorted body image, but not explicitly stated.\n\n8. **Depressive or Anxiety Disorders**: She denies depressed mood, sadness, hopelessness, excessive worry, or panic, so these are unlikely based on self-report.\n\n9. **Somatic Symptom Disorder**: She reports gastric reflux and bowel issues, but these seem related to her eating behaviors, not a primary somatic symptom disorder.\n\n10. **Factitious Disorder or Malingering**: No indication.\n\nPrimary diagnosis should be the most likely. Given the symptoms, anorexia nervosa seems primary.\n\nNow, for secondary diagnoses:\n\n- Even though she denies mood symptoms, eating disorders often co-occur with depression or anxiety. But she explicitly denies depressed mood and worry, so I should stick to the information provided. However, clinical expertise suggests that patients might underreport or not recognize symptoms, but the instruction is to base only on information provided. So, I should not assume depression or anxiety without evidence.\n\n- Laxative abuse could indicate a purging disorder, which is under OSFED.\n\n- Excessive exercise might be part of the eating disorder.\n\n- Amenorrhea is a medical consequence, not a psychiatric diagnosis.\n\n- Gastric reflux and bowel issues are medical, not psychiatric.\n\nPossible psychiatric comorbidities: In eating disorders, there can be comorbid conditions, but from the vignette, no other symptoms are mentioned.\n\nList top 5 diagnoses:\n\n1. Primary: Anorexia Nervosa, Restricting Type or with purging behaviors? In DSM-5, anorexia nervosa has specifiers: restricting type (during the last 3 months, no recurrent binge-eating or purging behaviors) or binge-eating\/purging type (with recurrent binge-eating or purging behaviors). She uses laxatives, which is purging, but no binge eating mentioned. So, it could be anorexia nervosa, binge-eating\/purging type if laxative use is considered purging without binge eating? Actually, in DSM-5, for anorexia nervosa, binge-eating\/purging type includes purging behaviors even in the absence of binge eating? I need to check. DSM-5 criteria for anorexia nervosa include persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain, such as purging behaviors (e.g., self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications). So, yes, laxative misuse is a purging behavior. Therefore, anorexia nervosa, binge-eating\/purging type, might apply if she engages in purging. But she doesn't binge eat, so it could still be restricting type if the laxative use is not frequent or specified. The vignette says she takes laxative twice daily, so it's recurrent. To be precise, in anorexia nervosa, the specifier is based on whether there are recurrent episodes of binge-eating or purging behavior. Purging behavior includes self-induced vomiting or misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas. So, since she uses laxatives, it could be considered purging behavior, making it binge-eating\/purging type, even without binge eating. However, the specifier name includes \"binge-eating,\" but the description allows for purging only. I think it's acceptable to diagnose anorexia nervosa with purging behaviors.\n\nFor coding, DSM-5 uses ICD-10 codes. Anorexia nervosa is F50.0, and specifiers don't change the code but are noted in the diagnosis.\n\nBut for the list, I need ICD-10 F-codes. So, for anorexia nervosa, F50.0.\n\nSecondary diagnoses: What other psychiatric conditions might be present? Since she denies mood and anxiety, perhaps no other disorders. But I need to list four secondary diagnoses. I should consider common comorbidities or other feeding and eating disorders.\n\nPossible secondary:\n\n- Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (OSFED) if anorexia criteria aren't fully met, but I think they are.\n\n- Unspecified Feeding or Eating Disorder.\n\n- Laxative Abuse as a substance use disorder? But in ICD-10, laxative abuse might fall under F55.8 for abuse of non-dependence-producing substances.\n\n- Exercise Dependence is not a DSM diagnosis.\n\n- Body Dysmorphic Disorder: No evidence.\n\n- Depression: Denied.\n\n- Anxiety: Denied.\n\nPerhaps I should include diagnoses that are less likely but possible based on the information.\n\nThe rubric says I'm performing at Level 5, so I need to be expert and accurate.\n\nLet's list the most likely psychiatric diagnoses based on DSM-5-TR:\n\n1. Anorexia Nervosa \u2013 F50.0\n\n2. Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (OSFED) \u2013 F50.8 (for other specified feeding or eating disorders)\n\nBut if anorexia nervosa is primary, OSFED might not be necessary.\n\n3. Purging Disorder \u2013 This is under OSFED, coded as F50.8.\n\n4. Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) \u2013 F50.8? Actually, ARFID is F50.8 in ICD-10, as it's under other eating disorders.\n\nIn ICD-10, F50.0 is anorexia nervosa, F50.1 is atypical anorexia nervosa, F50.2 is bulimia nervosa, F50.3 is atypical bulimia nervosa, F50.4 is overeating associated with other psychological disturbances, F50.5 is vomiting associated with other psychological disturbances, F50.8 is other eating disorders, F50.9 is eating disorder, unspecified.\n\nFor DSM-5, ARFID is F50.8, OSFED is F50.8, etc.\n\nSo, for secondary, I could include:\n\n- F50.8 for possible ARFID or OSFED, but since anorexia is likely, ARFID is less so.\n\n- Substance-related disorder: Laxative abuse might be F55.8 (Abuse of non-dependence-producing substances).\n\nFrom the vignette, she uses laxatives regularly, which could be substance misuse.\n\n- Somatic Symptom Disorder: For gastric reflux and bowel issues, but they are likely medical complications.\n\nShe reports gastric reflux waking her up, which might be due to eating behaviors, not a primary psychiatric condition.\n\nPerhaps no other clear psychiatric diagnoses. But I need to list five diagnoses.\n\nMaybe include:\n\n1. Anorexia Nervosa \u2013 F50.0\n\n2. Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (Purging Disorder) \u2013 F50.8\n\n3. Substance Use Disorder (Laxative Abuse) \u2013 F55.8\n\n4. Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder \u2013 F50.8\n\n5. Unspecified Feeding or Eating Disorder \u2013 F50.9\n\nBut that seems redundant.\n\nI should prioritize based on likelihood.\n\nPrimary: Anorexia Nervosa \u2013 F50.0\n\nSecondary: Since she denies mood and anxiety, but eating disorders often have comorbidities, I could include depressive disorder or anxiety disorder as possible, but she denied. However, in clinical practice, we might still consider them, but the instruction is to base only on information provided.\n\nThe vignette says: \"Erin reports that she has had no problems with depressed, sad or hopeless mood symptoms, and denied problems with excessive worry or panic.\" So, based on her report, no depression or anxiety. So, I should not include those.\n\nPerhaps other diagnoses:\n\n- Body Dysmorphic Disorder: No mention of body image concerns, but it's common in anorexia. But not explicitly stated, so I should avoid.\n\n- Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: Excessive exercise and rigid eating might resemble OCD, but no other symptoms.\n\nI think the most straightforward is anorexia nervosa as primary, and then for secondary, since there are multiple behaviors, I can list other eating disorder categories.\n\nLet's look at DSM-5 criteria for anorexia nervosa:\n\nA. Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements, leading to a significantly low body weight in the context of age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health.\n\nB. Intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, or persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain.\n\nC. Disturbance in the way in which one's body weight or shape is experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation, or persistent lack of recognition of the seriousness of the current low body weight.\n\nFor postmenarcheal females, amenorrhea is a specifier.\n\nIn the vignette: She restricts calories to less than 1000 per day, exercises excessively, uses laxatives, and has amenorrhea. Fear of weight gain is implied by aiming to eat less than 1000 calories. So, criteria A, B, and C are likely met, with amenorrhea.\n\nSo, anorexia nervosa is appropriate.\n\nFor other diagnoses:\n\n- Purging Disorder: Defined in OSFED as recurrent purging behavior to influence weight or shape in the absence of binge eating. She uses laxatives purging, so this could be a separate diagnosis if anorexia is not present, but since anorexia is present, it's part of it. In DSM-5, if criteria for anorexia are met, we don't diagnose purging disorder separately; it's subsumed under anorexia.\n\nSimilarly, excessive exercise is part of the eating disorder.\n\nSo, secondary diagnoses might include comorbidities that are common, but no evidence.\n\nPerhaps I should list other feeding and eating disorders as differentials, but for the top 5, I need to list actual diagnoses for this case.\n\nMaybe include:\n\n1. Anorexia Nervosa, Binge-Eating\/Purging Type \u2013 F50.01? In ICD-10, F50.0 is anorexia nervosa, and specifiers are not coded separately in F-codes; the same code is used regardless of subtype. So, for anorexia nervosa, it's F50.0.\n\nIn ICD-10-CM, which is used in the US, anorexia nervosa is coded as F50.00 for unspecified, F50.01 for restricting type, F50.02 for binge-eating\/purging type. But the instruction says ICD-10 F-codes, which might refer to the international version or general codes. To be precise, I'll use the basic F-codes.\n\nLooking up: In ICD-10, anorexia nervosa is F50.0, bulimia nervosa is F50.2, etc.\n\nFor this response, I'll use the standard ICD-10 codes as per DSM-5-TR alignment.\n\nDSM-5-TR includes ICD-10-CM codes for each disorder. For anorexia nervosa, it's F50.00 or F50.01\/F50.02 depending on subtype.\n\nBut for simplicity, since the instruction says \"ICD-10 F-code\", I'll use the main code.\n\nPerhaps for the list, I can specify with subtypes if needed.\n\nBut the formatting says \"<Primary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\", so I can write \"Anorexia Nervosa - F50.0\" or with subtype.\n\nTo be accurate, I should include the subtype in the diagnosis name.\n\nLet's decide on the primary diagnosis: Anorexia Nervosa, Binge-Eating\/Purging Type (since she uses laxatives) or Restricting Type? She restricts food and exercises, but also uses laxatives. In DSM-5, if purging behaviors are present, it's binge-eating\/purging type, even without binge eating. Yes, the specifier is \"binge-eating\/purging type\" which includes recurrent purging behavior. So, I'll go with that.\n\nSo, primary: Anorexia Nervosa, Binge-Eating\/Purging Type \u2013 F50.02 (in ICD-10-CM, but for international, F50.0. I'll use F50.0 for simplicity, or specify.\n\nTo match DSM-5, I'll use the codes as per DSM-5.\n\nDSM-5-TR codes for anorexia nervosa:\n\nF50.01 Restricting Type\n\nF50.02 Binge-Eating\/Purging Type\n\nSince she uses laxatives, F50.02.\n\nFor secondary diagnoses, I need four more.\n\nPossible secondary:\n\n1. Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (for any residual symptoms) \u2013 F50.8\n\n2. Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder \u2013 F50.8\n\n3. Substance-Induced Disorder (from laxative abuse) \u2013 Perhaps F55.8\n\n4. Somatic Symptom Disorder \u2013 F45.1\n\nBut she has gastric reflux and bowel issues, which could be somatic symptoms, but they are likely due to eating behaviors, not a primary somatic disorder.\n\nPerhaps no other clear diagnoses. In many cases, only one diagnosis is given.\n\nBut the instruction says to list top 5, so I need to list five even if less likely.\n\nI can list other eating disorders or common comorbidities.\n\nCommon comorbidities with anorexia nervosa include anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and OCD. But she denies anxiety and depression, so perhaps not.\n\nObsessive-compulsive traits might be present, but no diagnosis mentioned.\n\nAnother idea: Since she is 16, developmental issues? But no.\n\nPerhaps \"Feeding or Eating Disorder, Unspecified\" as a catch-all.\n\nI think I should list:\n\n1. Anorexia Nervosa, Binge-Eating\/Purging Type \u2013 F50.02\n\n2. Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (Purging Disorder) \u2013 F50.8  (but if anorexia is diagnosed, this is not separate; so perhaps not)\n\nPurging disorder is diagnosed when criteria for anorexia or bulimia are not met. Here, anorexia criteria are met, so purging disorder is not applicable.\n\nSo, for secondary, I could consider:\n\n- Laxative Abuse as a substance use disorder: In DSM-5, laxative misuse for weight control is not typically a separate substance use disorder; it's part of the eating disorder. But if it causes significant impairment, it might be noted. However, in ICD-10, there is F55.8 for abuse of non-psychoactive substances.\n\nSo, I could include: Abuse of non-psychoactive substances (laxatives) \u2013 F55.8\n\n- Exercise Dependence: Not a DSM diagnosis.\n\n- Body Dysmorphic Disorder: No evidence.\n\n- Depressive Disorder: Denied.\n\n- Anxiety Disorder: Denied.\n\nPerhaps \"Unspecified Feeding or Eating Disorder\" as a less specific option.\n\nI recall that in DSM-5, there is \"Feeding or Eating Disorder Not Elsewhere Classified\" but that's OSFED or UFED.\n\nTo fulfill the requirement, I'll list anorexia nervosa as primary, and then other possible eating disorder diagnoses that might be considered in differential.\n\nFinal list:\n\n1. Anorexia Nervosa, Binge-Eating\/Purging Type \u2013 F50.02\n\n2. Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder) \u2013 F50.8\n\n3. Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (Purging Disorder) \u2013 F50.8\n\n4. Unspecified Feeding or Eating Disorder \u2013 F50.9\n\n5. Abuse of Non-psychoactive Substances (Laxatives) \u2013 F55.8\n\nBut that seems forced.\n\nPerhaps include \"No other psychiatric diagnosis\" but the instruction says to list five.\n\nI think I should stick to the most likely based on expertise.\n\nAnother thought: She has amenorrhea, which is a medical condition, but for psychiatric, it's not a diagnosis.\n\nGastric reflux might be gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), but not psychiatric.\n\nSo, for psychiatric, the primary is anorexia, and secondary might be sparse.\n\nIn clinical practice, we might list only one diagnosis if no comorbidity.\n\nBut for this exercise, I need five.\n\nI'll proceed with:\n\n1. Anorexia Nervosa, Binge-Eating\/Purging Type \u2013 F50.02\n\n2. Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder \u2013 F50.8\n\n3. Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder \u2013 F50.8\n\n4. Purging Disorder \u2013 F50.8\n\n5. Unspecified Feeding or Eating Disorder \u2013 F50.9\n\nBut that's repetitive.\n\nI can use different F-codes for variety.\n\nIn ICD-10, for eating disorders:\n\nF50.0 Anorexia nervosa\n\nF50.1 Atypical anorexia nervosa\n\nF50.2 Bulimia nervosa\n\nF50.3 Atypical bulimia nervosa\n\nF50.4 Overeating associated with other psychological disturbances\n\nF50.5 Vomiting associated with other psychological disturbances\n\nF50.8 Other eating disorders\n\nF50.9 Eating disorder, unspecified\n\nF55.8 Abuse of non-psychoactive substances\n\nSo, for this case:\n\nPrimary: F50.0 for anorexia nervosa.\n\nSecondary: Since she uses laxatives and has restrictive eating, but no binge eating, atypical anorexia (F50.1) might be if weight is not low, but we don't know weight. Atypical anorexia is when all criteria for anorexia are met except weight is within or above normal range. From the vignette, we don't have weight information, so it's possible, but amenorrhea suggests low weight or physiological disturbance. I'll assume anorexia criteria are met.\n\nBulimia nervosa (F50.2) requires binge eating, so not applicable.\n\nOvereating (F50.4) not applicable.\n\nVomiting (F50.5) not applicable, as she doesn't vomit.\n\nSo, other eating disorders (F50.8) for ARFID or purging disorder.\n\nAbuse of substances (F55.8).\n\nPerhaps include F45.1 for somatic symptom disorder if we consider her gastric reflux as a somatic concern, but she reports it as a symptom, not necessarily with excessive thoughts.\n\nI think for secondary, I'll list:\n\n2. Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (Purging Disorder) \u2013 F50.8\n\n3. Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder \u2013 F50.8\n\n4. Abuse of Non-psychoactive Substances (Laxatives) \u2013 F55.8\n\n5.

She reports gastric reflux waking her up, but no mention of excessive worry about it. So, likely not.\n\nTo simplify, I'll go with anorexia as primary, and since no other symptoms, I'll list other eating disorder categories as differentials.\n\nBut the instruction is to diagnose the clinical case vignette, so for this case, the diagnosis is anorexia nervosa, and perhaps no others.\n\nI recall that in the rubric, I'm to perform at Level 5, so I should be accurate and complete.\n\nLet's read the vignette again: \"She reports that she has had no problems with depressed, sad or hopeless mood symptoms, and denied problems with excessive worry or panic.\" So, explicitly no mood or anxiety symptoms reported.\n\nTherefore, only eating disorder symptoms are present.\n\nSo, primary diagnosis: Anorexia Nervosa.\n\nFor secondary, I can list conditions that are commonly associated or that might be considered in the differential.\n\nList:\n\n1. Anorexia Nervosa, Binge-Eating\/Purging Type \u2013 F50.02\n\n2. Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (Purging Disorder) \u2013 F50.8\n\n3.

Abuse of Non-psychoactive Substances \u2013 F55.8\n\nI think that's acceptable.\n\nTo make it better, I'll use the most likely secondary diagnoses based on clinical expertise.\n\nAnother idea: Since she is 16, there might be developmental issues, but no diagnosis.\n\nPerhaps \"No diagnosis\" for some, but I need five.\n\nI'll proceed with the list.\n\nFor formatting, I'll write:\n\n1. Anorexia Nervosa, Binge-Eating\/Purging Type - F50.02\n\n2. Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (Purging Disorder) - F50.8\n\n3. Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder - F50.8\n\n4. Unspecified Feeding or Eating Disorder - F50.9\n\n5. Abuse of Non-psychoactive Substances (Laxatives) - F55.8\n\nBut in reality, if anorexia is diagnosed, purging disorder and ARFID are not separately diagnosed, so they should be listed as differentials, but for the list, I think it's okay.\n\nPerhaps I should list only one eating disorder diagnosis and then others like \"Feeding or Eating Condition Not Elsewhere Classified\" but that's vague.\n\nI think for the purpose of this task, I'll provide this list.",

    "vignette":"Ursula Norman, a 32-year-old nurse, was brought to an emergency department 6 days after giving birth. Her husband stated that she had been behaving very strangely and that she had become convinced that she had smothered and killed her baby.\n\nHer husband reported that after a normal pregnancy and uncomplicated delivery, Ms. Norman had happily gone home with their first child. On the third day after delivery, however, her mood and affect began to shift rapidly between elation and weepiness. She became irritable and anxious. She slept only an hour a night, even when her baby was asleep. Her behavior became increasingly bizarre, with overactivity and agitation. Her speech was rapid and digressive. Although not previously a religious person, she became convinced that God was speaking through her and that she had special powers that could solve the problems of the world. She told her husband that she could identify evil people by looking into their eyes and had begun to worry that she was surrounded by evil people, including her own mother. Most disturbing for her, whenever she was out of sight of her son, she became totally convinced that she had smothered him, and no one could convince her otherwise.\n\nMs. Norman had a history of three episodes of major depressive disorder in her teens and early 20s. These episodes resolved with psychotherapy and antidepressant medication. She also had a psychiatric admission for mania 3 years prior to the delivery of her child, after a flight from Asia to Europe. Following treatment with antipsychotic medication, she became depressed for several months. Although a diagnosis of bipolar disorder was discussed at this time, she was reluctant to accept this label, attributing the episode to stress and jet lag. She had discontinued the psychiatric medication in anticipation of getting pregnant.\n\nMs. Norman\u2019s own mother had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital shortly after the birth of her first child. This episode was not talked about in the family, and there were few other details. She had no other family history of note.\n\nUntil just before delivery of her child, Ms. Norman had been a highly functional nurse in a renal unit. Her husband was the head of a sales team, and they lived in comfortable social circumstances. She had no history of illicit drug use and, prior to pregnancy, drank only 2 or 3 units of alcohol a week.\n\nOn mental status examination, Ms. Norman wandered around the room, seemingly unable to sit for more than a few moments. She was distractible and overtalkative, and demonstrated flight of ideas, flitting from one subject to another. Her mood was labile. At times she appeared happily euphoric. At other times she was tearful, and she could become quickly irritable when she felt she was not being understood. It was clear that she had a number of delusional beliefs but was unwilling to discuss most of them with the examiner. She did insist that she had already killed her own child, which led to several minutes of tears, but she returned to an edgy euphoria within a few minutes. She denied intent to harm herself or anyone else. She appeared inattentive, with poor concentration, but would not participate in formal cognitive testing.\n\nPhysical examination and laboratory testing results were all within normal limits.",

The semiology of the seizure was such that there would be an aura-tingling sensation in limbs, ringing in ears, and fearfulness for less than a minute, followed by focal onset seizure-twisting of the upper limb and head toward left with stiffening and jerky movements of all four limbs with unconsciousness associated with tongue bite, injury due to fall and episodes also occurred during sleep. He would be confused for a few minutes after gaining consciousness, complain of headaches, and would sleep at times. He had stopped going to school for 4 years and would refuse to visit his relatives because of fear of a seizure episode. He was treated with sodium valproate up to 800\u2009mg for a year, 2 years back with irregular follow-ups. As a few episodes of seizure occurred in-between, the family opted for treatment from traditional healers instead of medicine, and he had been noncompliant for a year.

The general physical and systemic examination, blood parameters, and MRI brain were normal. EEG showed slow background activity with sharp and spike-wave complexes in both cerebral hemispheres.\n\nAfter optimizing the dose of valproate, he was seizure-free for 6 days. However, he presented to the emergency department with drowsiness, decreased alertness, lethargy, and drooling of saliva with a serum valproate level of 76\u2009mg\/L. In view of the sedating side effect of sodium valproate, the antiepileptic was changed to tablet LEV 500\u2009mg BD. The drowsiness improved after stopping valproate and starting LEV. On the 2nd day, he started saying that he felt like going crazy. On the fourth day, he was restless, agitated, and tried to run away from the ward with delusion of persecution and auditory hallucination, second person voices commenting.

They describe their living situation as \"overwhelming\" due to parental boundary issues, though they maintain a supportive romantic relationship since 2019. Their psychiatric history includes diagnoses of MDD and GAD at age 15-16, PTSD in 2016 following emotional abuse by high school friends, and ADHD in 2018 (without neuropsychological evaluation). Current medications include Lisdexamfetamine 50mg (since 2018), various supplements, and a contraceptive injection. They previously tried multiple antidepressants (2011-2015) but discontinued each after approximately two weeks due to suicidal ideation and, in one case, motor disturbances. The patient consumes alcohol socially (3-5 drinks monthly) and has been vaping marijuana 1-3 times weekly for three months primarily to aid sleep and manage anxiety. The patient's primary symptoms onset around age 5 with intrusive visualizations of falling down stairs along with perfectionism through rewriting notes until they felt \"just right\". Currently, they experience significant distress when surroundings are not in the \"right spot\", spending up to 12 hours reorganizing belongings without breaks, which would cause severe distress if interrupted. This \"not just right\" feeling impairs their ability to meet deadlines, complete job applications, and fulfill social obligations. They also engage in checking behaviors when packing (counting socks repeatedly, checking for essential items) and experience distressing sexual intrusive thoughts. Additionally, the patient exhibits skin-picking behaviors, spending over an hour picking at ingrown hairs until bleeding, scratching their neck and jaw during conversations, and tearing at cuticles, with symptoms worsening during periods of anxiety. They've attempted to stop by wearing pants constantly but have been unsuccessful. The patient has a significant history of depression with three past suicide attempts (overdoses in 2014, 2015, and 2017) and self-injury through cutting (stopped in 2017). They currently experience passive suicidal ideation, anhedonia, decreased appetite, sleep difficulties, psychomotor agitation, feelings of worthlessness, and concentration problems, though they report 0% chance of self-harm in the next three months. Social anxiety manifests as persistent fear of judgment and rejection, with distressing rumination about social interactions and excessive reassurance-seeking that has cost them friendships.

Because she appeared to be an \u201cemotionally disturbed person,\u201d a psychiatry consultation was requested.\n\nAccording to the police report, Ms. Allen threatened the driver with a knife, took control of the almost empty city bus, and crashed it. A more complete story was elicited from a friend of Ms. Allen\u2019s who had been on the bus but who had not been arrested. According to her, they had boarded the bus on their way to a nearby shopping mall. Ms. Allen became frustrated when the driver refused her dollar bills, instead demanding exact change. She looked in her purse, but instead of finding exact change, she pulled out a kitchen knife that she carried for protection. The driver fled, so she got into the empty seat and drove the bus across the street into a nearby parked car.\n\nOn examination, Ms. Allen was a handcuffed, heavyset young woman with a bandage on her forehead. She fidgeted and rocked back and forth in her chair. She appeared to be mumbling to herself. When asked what she was saying, the patient made momentary eye contact and just repeated, \u201cSorry, sorry.\u201d She did not respond to other questions.\n\nMore information was elicited from a psychiatrist who had come to the ER soon after the accident. He said that Ms. Allen and her friend were longtime residents at the state psychiatric hospital where he worked. They had just begun to take passes every week as part of an effort toward social remediation; it had been Ms. Allen\u2019s first bus ride without a staff member.\n\nAccording to the psychiatrist, Ms. Allen had received a diagnosis of \u201cchildhood-onset, treatment-resistant paranoid schizophrenia.\u201d She had started hearing voices by age 5 years. Big, strong, intrusive, and psychotic, she had been hospitalized almost constantly since age 11. Her auditory hallucinations generally consisted of a critical voice commenting on her behavior. Her thinking was concrete, but when relaxed she could be self-reflective. She was motivated to please and recurrently said her biggest goal was to \u201chave my own room in my own house with my own friends.\u201d The psychiatrist said that he was not sure what had caused her to pull out the knife. She had not been hallucinating lately and had been feeling less paranoid, but he wondered if she had been more psychotic than she had let on. It was possible that she was just impatient and irritated. The psychiatrist also believed that she had spent almost no period of life developing normally and so had very little experience with the real world.\n\nMs. Allen had been taking clozapine for 1 year, with good resolution of her auditory hallucinations. She had gained 35 pounds on the clozapine, but she had less trouble getting out of bed in the morning and was functioning at a higher level. She was hoping to get a job and live more independently, and the bus trip had been intended as a step in that direction. Because of these improvements and goals, she had insisted on continuing to take the clozapine despite the weight gain.",

However, he is irritable and hostile, telling the physician to \u201cfuck off\u201d and that \u201cthe devil is out to get you\u201d. He states he is \u201clike a God\u201d and that he was unfairly arrested. On chart review, he has a history of being prescribed antipsychotics, but currently pt denies taking any psychiatric medications. Assessment was limited due to the patient\u2019s lack of engagement and hostility. Lab work was significant for UDS positive for marijuana, methamphetamine, and PCP. He started on a low-dose of scheduled Risperidone. The next day, he was reassessed by psychiatry. He is less hostile, but still irritable and asks if he can sleep. On limited assessment, pt denied thinking the devil was after him and did not make any grandiose statements about him being God. He did not appear internally preoccupied but was very sleepy. He was later assessed in the afternoon after he was repotedly asking to leave. He denied suicidal ideations, homicidal ideations, or auditory\/visual hallucinations. While he was still irritable, he was more cooperative and states he does not recall being at a gas station. He does endorse to using marijuana, methamphetamine, and PCP \u201cfor 2 days straight\u201d. He is currently homeless and wants to go to the shelter. He denies paranoia or any belief that he is God, states \u201cthat\u2019s ridiculous\u201d when asked that question. Patient was then discharged after spending 24 hours in the ED.",

    "vignette":"A 39-year-old Caucasian male presented to inpatient psychiatry after initially presenting to the emergency department with psychosis. He had been found crawling in a parking lot with several feet of intestines dragging on the ground. The patient was only responding internally during the examination, and a urine drug screen was positive only for cannabis. He received an emergent exploratory laparotomy with a partial colectomy. He stabilized medically but became briefly catatonic on day six of hospitalization, which was resolved with intravenous diazepam. On day seven, he was transferred to the inpatient psychiatry unit on a voluntary basis.\n\nOn admission to inpatient psychiatry, the patient was fully oriented and able to recall stabbing himself in the abdomen because characters in his mind told him to, having an out-of-body experience as he watched himself pull out several feet of intestines. He felt compelled to follow the voices' commands because he had guilt about his history of sexual abuse towards women. He then recalls running out of his apartment and waking up in the hospital. He endorsed paranoia and auditory hallucinations for the last 10 years but never sought treatment. He felt hopeless, yet believed his potential was infinite. He had no suicidal ideation and expressed a fear of hurting himself upon returning home if the voices persisted.\n\nHe had never been diagnosed with a psychiatric illness or received treatment, but he did see a psychiatrist at age 17 after he was charged with indecent exposure. He recalled periods in his life when he had little need for sleep, had racing thoughts, and felt that signs and advertisements were speaking directly to him. His social history was notable for heavy cannabis use beginning at age 18. He was a daily user for 5-6 years and began experiencing paranoia and auditory hallucinations. Despite quitting for two years, the psychotic symptoms persisted, and he reported currently using cannabis 3-4 days per week. He also had a history of trauma and was emotionally and physically abused by his father who had alcohol use disorder.\n\nOn a physical exam, the patient had normal speech and appearance, an expansive affect, and poor insight. He endorsed auditory hallucinations of male voices that were commanding and feelings of paranoia.",

While Mr. Young sat quietly beside her, she reported that a change had come over him during the last 6 months. He was either quiet and withdrawn or uncharacteristically irritable. He had begun to drink alcohol to excess in social situations, sometimes embarrassing her. He often came home late, or not at all, claiming to have been at the office. When away from home, he rarely answered phone calls and text messages. She wondered if he was having an affair. Mr. Young denied seeing anyone else and indicated he had just been having a hard time.\n\nAfter his wife left the psychiatrist\u2019s office, Mr. Young reported a great deal of stress at work over the last year as he tried to deal with industry-wide setbacks and personal financial losses. He said he felt down and depressed most of the time. He reported difficulty sleeping most nights, loss of interest in his wife and children, low energy, and feelings of failure and self-criticism. He had frequent thoughts of wanting to be dead and of suicide, but he denied any suicidal intent or plans.\n\nWhen asked about the alcohol, he acknowledged that he had been drinking heavily for at least 6 months. When asked about other substances, he asked about therapeutic confidentiality and then acknowledged that he had been using cocaine several times per week for about 9 months. He kept his cocaine use from his wife because he knew she would be judgmental. In the beginning, cocaine put him in a reliably positive, optimistic mood, and he found that he could more successfully churn through large volumes of otherwise tedious and discouraging work. Although his work required some socializing in the evening, he also began to regularly go to bars in the evening just so that he would have a place to comfortably combine cocaine with alcohol. He craved the high from cocaine, went out of his way to obtain it, and spent a lot of time getting high that he would previously have been spending with his family.\n\nWhen asked to clarify the sequence of work stress, cocaine use, and depression symptoms, he reported that he had felt worried and discouraged about work for a year, but the feelings of depression, loss of interest, irritability, insomnia, and low self-esteem had not begun until about 6 months earlier, 3 months after he had begun to use cocaine regularly. He experienced those depressive symptoms most of the day every day, whether or not he had taken cocaine within the last several days.\n\nMr. Young denied any previous episodes of depression, other mood or anxiety disorders, or suicide attempts. He drank socially. He had experimented with cannabis and cocaine as a teenager but had never developed a pattern of regular use or impairment until the past year.",

    "vignette":"Sebastian Lopez, a 27-year-old Hispanic freelance editor, was brought to his long-time HIV clinic by his worried partner. As the patient entered the clinic waiting room, he announced, \u201cGod has cured me! I can stop my antivirals!\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. Lopez fidgeted on a chair, furiously writing on a yellow pad, his partner provided the recent history. He said that the patient had been doing well until approximately 1 month earlier. At that point, he began an unusually intense editing project. After about 10 days of little sleep, \u201cboundless energy,\u201d and activity, Mr. Lopez seemed edgy, a little pressured, and \u201cglassy-eyed.\u201d That night, the two of them went to a party to celebrate the completion of the work project. Despite several years of Narcotics Anonymous meetings and abstinence from illicit substances, Mr. Lopez took crystal methamphetamine, a stimulant. Acutely anxious and paranoid that they were being followed, Mr. Lopez drank three martinis but still did not sleep that night. Over the ensuing days the patient became less paranoid, but he appeared increasingly distracted and his speech was more pressured.\n\nMr. Lopez\u2019s work project was returned with multiple negative comments and requests for corrections. Instead of focusing on his editing, however, he stayed up late every night, intent on finding a cure for HIV. He made inappropriate, hypersexual advances toward other men at the gym, where he spent much of the day. He lost at least 5 pounds after deciding he should take vitamin supplements instead of food and his antiretroviral medication. He refused to go to the emergency room but finally agreed to come to his routine AIDS clinic appointment to show his doctors how well he had done despite not having taken his medications in over a month.\n\nMr. Lopez\u2019s psychiatric history was without a prior episode of clear-cut mania, but he had been depressed as a teenager during the early phase of his coming-out process. That episode was punctuated by a purposeful overdose and a 2-week psychiatric hospitalization and treatment with antidepressant medication and psychotherapy. Mr. Lopez had discontinued the medication because it made him \u201chyper and edgy,\u201d and he stopped the psychotherapy because \u201cit was pointless.\u201d He used methamphetamine frequently for several years, which led to recurrent unprotected intercourse with strangers.\n\nMr. Lopez was diagnosed with HIV at age 22, at which point he went to an outpatient substance use disorder rehabilitation center and discontinued his use of stimulants and alcohol. His lowest CD4 lymphocyte count had been 216 cells\/mm3, when he was age 24, at which time his viral load was 1.6 million copies. He had been reportedly adherent to his antiretroviral medications since then. His most recent CD4 count, 6 months prior to this episode, had been 526 cells\/mm3. His viral load had been undetectable. He had suffered fatigue but had not had any AIDS-defining illnesses. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain revealed mild cortical atrophy and periventricular white matter disease in excess of what would be expected for his age. The partner was unsure when Mr. Lopez had discontinued his antiretrovirals but thought it might have been months earlier. He also wondered if Mr. Lopez had \u201clost a step\u201d cognitively over the past year.\n\nHis family psychiatric history was significant for a maternal aunt who had received lithium and several courses of electroconvulsive therapy, but her diagnosis was unknown.\n\nOn examination, the patient was a sloppily dressed young man who told a pressured, disjointed story of events over the prior month. He was difficult to direct and was uncharacteristically irritable and devaluing. He was preoccupied with having discovered a cure for HIV through multivitamins and exercise. He denied hallucinations and suicidal and homicidal ideation. He refused cognitive testing, and his insight and judgment appeared poor.",

The cortical atrophy and white matter disease could be contributing factors but don't explain the full syndrome.\n\nFor differential diagnosis: primary bipolar I disorder seems most likely given duration and severity.
