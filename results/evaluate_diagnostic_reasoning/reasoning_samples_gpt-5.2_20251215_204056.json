    "vignette":"Terry Najarian, a 65-year-old salesman for a large corporation, presented for a psychiatric evaluation after his wife threatened to leave him. Although he said he was embarrassed to discuss his issues with a stranger, he described his sexual interest in women\u2019s undergarments in a quite matter-of-fact manner. This interest had surfaced several years earlier and had not been a problem until he was caught masturbating by his wife 6 weeks prior to the evaluation. Upon seeing him dressed in panties and a bra, she initially \u201cwent nuts,\u201d thinking he was having an affair. After he clarified that he was not seeing anyone else, she \u201cshut him out\u201d and hardly spoke to him. When they argued, she called him a \u201cpervert\u201d and made it clear that she was considering divorce unless he \u201cgot help.\u201d\n\nMr. Najarian\u2019s habit began in the setting of his wife\u2019s severe arthritis and likely depression, both of which significantly reduced her overall activity level and specifically her interest in sex. His \u201cfetish\u201d was the bright spot during his frequent and otherwise dreary business trips. He also masturbated at home but generally waited until his wife was out of the house. His specific pattern was to masturbate about twice weekly, using bras and panties that he had collected over several years. He said that intercourse with his wife had faded to \u201cevery month or two\u201d but was mutually satisfying.\n\nThe patient had been married for over 30 years, and the couple had two grown children. Mr. Najarian had planned to retire comfortably later that year, but not if the two choices were either \u201cto be poor after we split the assets or to sit around the house all day and be called a pervert.\u201d\n\nHe became visibly anxious when discussing his marital difficulties. He described some recent difficulty falling asleep and \u201cworried constantly\u201d about his marriage but denied other psychiatric problems. He had made a show of throwing away a half dozen pieces of underwear, which had seemed to reassure his wife, but he had saved his \u201cfavorites\u201d and \u201ccould always buy more.\u201d He said he was of mixed mind. He did not want to end his marriage, but he saw nothing harmful in his new mode of masturbating. \u201cI\u2019m not unfaithful or doing anything bad,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just excites me, and my wife certainly doesn\u2019t want to be having sex a few times a week.\u201d\n\nMr. Najarian denied any difficulties related to sexual functioning, adding that he could maintain erections and achieve orgasm without women\u2019s undergarments. He recalled being aroused when he touched women\u2019s underwear as a teenager and had masturbated repeatedly to that experience. That fantasy had disappeared when he became sexually active with his wife. He denied any personal or family history of mental illness.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Considering ICD-10 F-codes**\n\nI\u2019m contemplating whether we can provide F51.01 as an ICD-10 F-code. It doesn\u2019t match the DSM\u2019s recommended code, yet it\u2019s still categorized as F. I\u2019m unsure about including sleep-wake disorders, as they are under DSM, but the user specified F-codes only. Insomnia disorder is off the table since its ICD-10 code is G47.00. I need to consider other diagnoses that fit the criteria, but \u201cPartner relational problem\u201d also misses the mark as it\u2019s Z63.0.\n\n**Selecting F-coded diagnoses**\n\nI need to stick to F-coded disorders since Z-codes aren\u2019t allowed. I can choose four secondary F-coded psychiatric diagnoses. \"Unspecified anxiety disorder\" (F41.9), \"Generalized anxiety disorder\" (F41.1), and \"Other specified anxiety disorder\" (F41.8) are options. I\u2019m considering \"Other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder\" (F42.8), but he doesn\u2019t have obsessions, so that's tricky. I doubt including \"Depressive disorder due to medical condition\" or \"Alcohol use disorder\" will work either. I'm also weighing \"Unspecified sexual dysfunction\" (F52.9) but he denies any issues. \u201cMale orgasmic disorder\u201d isn\u2019t applicable, nor is \u201cGender dysphoria\u201d (F64.1). I might reconsider including \"Paraphilic disorder, unspecified\" (F65.9) or \"Other specified paraphilic disorder\" (F65.89) depending on the context.\n\n**Deciding on diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m considering including \"Transvestic disorder\" (F65.1) in the top five diagnoses, alongside primary \"Fetishistic disorder\" (F65.0) and \"Adjustment disorder with anxiety\" (F43.22). For anxiety, I could either list \"Generalized anxiety disorder\" (F41.1) or \"Unspecified anxiety disorder\" (F41.9), since he denies other problems. However, I can't mention Z-coded relationship issues. If needed, I might also include \"Other specified paraphilic disorder\" (F65.89) or \"Unspecified paraphilic disorder\" (F65.9) as alternatives while considering the nuances between \"Fetishism\" and \"Transvestic fetishism.\"\n\n**Evaluating diagnostic criteria**\n\nI see that he collects underwear and engages in cross-dressing, but there\u2019s a nuance in the DSM diagnostic distinctions. Fetishistic disorder excludes clothing used in cross-dressing, so I need to consider this carefully. The DSM-5 states that fetish objects aren\u2019t limited to cross-dressing clothing, pointing toward transvestic disorder if the fetish is focused on those items. Since he collects bras and panties, and has a sexual interest in them, it seems like transvestic disorder might be the more fitting diagnosis here.\n\n**Analyzing diagnostic options**\n\nI\u2019m diving into the nuances of diagnosing his arousal related to underwear. The DSM-5 states undergarments can be fetish objects but notes they\u2019re not limited to clothing for cross-dressing. Many fetishistic individuals are aroused by women\u2019s underwear without cross-dressing. If his focus is mainly on cross-dressing clothing, I should consider transvestic disorder, especially since he collects and sometimes wears bras and panties. However, he doesn\u2019t necessarily identify as female. \n\nHis interest has persisted over years, and his marital challenges indicate some level of distress, making his situation complex. While I think primarily of Transvestic disorder (with a fetishism specifier), I can still note Fetishistic disorder as a secondary option. Ultimately, his scenario highlights the need for careful consideration of both diagnoses, depending on how these concepts interact in his life.\n\n**Selecting likely diagnoses**\n\nThey need a list of the top five most likely diagnoses, including one primary and four secondary options. I see that fetishistic disorder fits well given the described sexual interest in women's undergarments. While he wears them too, this could lean towards transvestic disorder, but his main focus seems to be on the objects rather than the act of cross-dressing. \n\nFor secondary diagnoses, I\u2019ll include transvestic disorder, an adjustment disorder with anxiety, unspecified anxiety disorder, and an unspecified paraphilic disorder. The list should be: \n\n1. Fetishistic disorder (F65.0)\n2. Transvestic disorder (F65.1)\n3. Adjustment disorder with anxiety (F43.22)\n4. Unspecified anxiety disorder (F41.9)\n5. Unspecified paraphilic disorder (F65.9)\n\n**Finalizing diagnoses list**\n\nI'm focusing on the diagnoses based on the analysis of the case involving arousal from women's undergarments. It appears we have a spectrum of possibilities impacting how we classify his condition. Fetishistic disorder might flag his primary arousal toward undergarments. However, since he does cross-dress, transvestic disorder could also be valid.\n\nFor a rounded list, I\u2019m suggesting:\n\n1. Fetishistic disorder - ICD-10 F65.0\n2. Transvestic disorder - ICD-10 F65.1\n3. Adjustment disorder with anxiety - ICD-10 F43.22\n4. Unspecified anxiety disorder - ICD-10 F41.9\n5. Unspecified paraphilic disorder - ICD-10 F65.9\n\nThis covers a range of potential diagnoses.\n\n**Choosing the final diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m working through the diagnoses based on the individual's symptoms and behaviors. I see that we may have to balance between adjustment disorder and unspecified anxiety disorder, along with paraphilic conditions. Since we need to list five likely diagnoses, I\u2019m proposing:\n\n1. Fetishistic disorder - F65.0\n2. Transvestic disorder - F65.1\n3. Adjustment disorder with anxiety - F43.22\n4. Unspecified anxiety disorder - F41.9\n5. Unspecified paraphilic disorder - F65.9\n\nI\u2019ll ensure this list follows the structured guidelines.\n\n**Finalizing the diagnosis list**\n\nI\u2019m evaluating whether to identify this individual with Fetishistic disorder as the primary diagnosis since there's substantial evidence. While there\u2019s uncertainty about regular cross-dressing, his behavior seems to indicate it\u2019s not required for sexual function. Although he experiences marital conflict, it could lead to impairment, which is necessary for a paraphilic disorder. I\u2019ll create a structured list that adheres strictly to the criteria:\n\n1. Fetishistic disorder - F65.0  \n2. Transvestic disorder - F65.1  \n3. Adjustment disorder with anxiety - F43.22  \n4. Unspecified anxiety disorder - F41.9  \n5. Unspecified paraphilic disorder - F65.9",

    "vignette":"A 27-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of convulsions.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 2 years before this admission, when shaking of the trunk, arms, and legs occurred. The episode lasted approximately 4 to 5 minutes and had been preceded by a sharp pain in the back of the head that radiated to the neck, blurred vision, palpitations, nausea, and difficulty concentrating. The patient did not seek evaluation, and no additional convulsive episodes occurred during the subsequent 20 months.\nFour months before this admission, while the patient was drinking alcohol at a party, his body suddenly became stiff, and he fell backward onto a table. Shaking of the trunk, arms, and legs occurred for approximately 5 to 8 minutes. He had urinary incontinence but did not bite his tongue. Five minutes later, similar convulsions occurred. The patient was taken to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. The results of computed tomography of the head were normal, as was an electroencephalogram (EEG) that was obtained over a period of 40 minutes. Treatment with levetiracetam was started. The patient was discharged home with a recommendation for follow-up evaluation at the neurology clinic of the other hospital.\nThree months before this admission, the patient was evaluated at the neurology clinic of the other hospital. He reported that despite the use of levetiracetam, convulsions occurred approximately once per week. The results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, were reportedly normal. Treatment with lamotrigine was started. There was no change in the quality or frequency of the convulsive episodes.\nOne month before this admission, while the patient was at work, his colleagues found him on the floor, and they witnessed \u201cshaking and clenching\u201d movements of the trunk, arms, and legs that lasted approximately 2 minutes. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was taken to the emergency department of a second hospital for evaluation.\nAt least two additional convulsive episodes occurred at the second hospital. During one episode, the shaking movements became less intense when the physician\u2019s hand was placed on the patient\u2019s shoulder; the movements resumed at the previous intensity when the hand was removed. In addition, the patient\u2019s eyes were closed. When the eyelids were opened manually, no nystagmus or gaze deviation was present. When the eyelids were released, the eyes shut forcefully and Bell\u2019s phenomenon (upward deviation of the eyes when closing) occurred. The patient did not speak but was able to follow simple verbal commands, such as an instruction to squeeze the physician\u2019s hands. In between the convulsive episodes, there were intermittent rocking movements of the upper body and nonrhythmic tremulous movements of the hands, and the patient did not speak or follow commands. After several hours, the episodes stopped, and the patient was able to speak. Admission to the hospital was recommended; however, the patient declined because of work obligations and anxiety about being in the hospital. He was discharged home.\nDuring the subsequent month, the patient continued to take levetiracetam and lamotrigine. However, the convulsions increased in frequency to one to three times per week.\nOn the morning before the current admission, while the patient was at work, his colleagues noticed that he abruptly stopped speaking and began to have shaking movements of the arms and legs. Emergency medical services were called. On their arrival, the patient\u2019s body was stiff, and there was twitching of the trunk, arms, and legs. No urinary or fecal incontinence or biting of the tongue had occurred. The patient was able to stand up from a chair and walk to the ambulance. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 111\/56 mm Hg, the pulse 83 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was awake and alert but did not speak. His eyes were open, with a primary midline gaze and blinking in response to visual threat. His body appeared stiff, with the arms and legs straightened. There were intermittent nonrhythmic tremulous movements of the trunk, arms, and legs. The patient was able to follow complex commands and to move the arms and legs symmetrically and against gravity, but there was a delay in motor activation. The deep-tendon reflexes were normal. Extensive scarring from burns was present on the face, trunk, back, arms, and legs.\nApproximately 45 minutes after the tremulous movements had stopped, the patient was able to speak but with limited fluency. Additional history was obtained. He had been taking levetiracetam and lamotrigine as directed; however, 3 days before this evaluation, he had stopped taking these medications because he was unsure whether they were effective. That morning, he had felt well until he noticed a sharp pain in the back of his head that radiated to his neck, along with sudden blurred vision, full-body numbness, and difficulty concentrating. A convulsive episode then occurred that lasted up to 20 minutes; during the episode, the patient was aware of events but sometimes had difficulty hearing. He described his overall mood as \u201cpretty good\u201d and did not report decreased energy or chronic fatigue. There was no history of psychotic or manic symptoms, suicidal ideation, or obsessive or compulsive behaviors.\nThe patient had a history of a febrile seizure in childhood, as well as several concussions that had occurred while he was playing sports in childhood. He reported that during the first 6 years of life, his social supports were limited, and he had experienced maltreatment by a family member; he did not elaborate on the nature of the maltreatment. In late childhood, he was involved in a house fire and hospitalized for a prolonged period because of severe burns on the face, body, arms, and legs. He had asthma, major depressive disorder, chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and panic disorder with agoraphobia. He took escitalopram daily and lorazepam as needed for panic attacks. He was in a long-term romantic relationship. He did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs; he smoked marijuana approximately once per year and drank one alcoholic beverage per week. His father had died of heart disease when the patient was a teenager; his mother had schizoaffective disorder and post-traumatic epilepsy.\nBlood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The blood lactate level was 2.4 mmol per liter (22 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.2 mmol per liter [5 to 20 mg per deciliter]) and the blood creatine kinase level 489 U per liter (reference range, 60 to 400). Serum and urine toxicologic panels were negative. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was admitted to this hospital.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Evaluating diagnoses and codes**\n\nI'm determining the appropriate DSM-5-TR codes. For Agoraphobia, it's F40.00, so that's clear. For Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), I see codes like F32.9 for unspecified single episode and F33.9 for recurrent, but the details are missing. Given the patient's age, I'll lean towards F32.9, even though there's potential for recurrent episodes, especially since he\u2019s on escitalopram. I\u2019m also considering conditions like conversion disorder due to trauma, plus possibly \"Other specified dissociative disorder\" for unresponsive episodes.\n\n**Assessing diagnoses for symptoms**\n\nThe patient is refusing hospital admission due to anxiety, which might relate to agoraphobia. Since he shows mutism during episodes but can follow commands, I\u2019m considering \"conversion disorder with speech symptom (mutism)\" or \"dissociative stupor.\" As for likely diagnoses, I\u2019ll prioritize \"Functional neurological symptom disorder\" as primary, alongside secondary options like PTSD, panic disorder, and major depressive disorder. I also wonder about \"Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures\" considering his symptoms, including sharp pain, blurred vision, and nausea. So, that's the focus.\n\n**Considering possible diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about the patient's episodes, which might relate to PNES, especially since triggers and somatic symptoms can play a role. The episodes occurred while drinking, but he typically drinks minimally. Even though he has a normal EEG, there are strong non-epileptic features like eye closure and preserved awareness. It seems conversion disorder is more likely, but I want to ensure I have the required F-codes for psychiatric diagnoses, including PTSD, panic disorder, and major depressive disorder.\n\n**Confirming diagnostic codes**\n\nI\u2019m confirming the ICD-10 codes for the diagnoses. For functional neurological symptom disorder with seizures, F44.5 is correct; it\u2019s also noted as \"dissociative convulsions\" in some contexts. For PTSD, I\u2019ll go with F43.12 for chronic, since it fits the description; F43.10 would be for unspecified. Panic disorder should use F41.0, and agoraphobia is F40.00. For major depressive disorder, I\u2019ll list F32.9 as unspecified since we don\u2019t have clear details on recurrence. That seems accurate!\n\n**Finalizing the diagnosis selection**\n\nI could select F33.9 for \"Major depressive disorder, recurrent, unspecified.\" However, \"recurrent\" implies at least two episodes, which isn't indicated here, so I\u2019ll stick with F32.9. Since the patient is 27 and has a history, there\u2019s potential for recurrence, but I can't assume that. It's also crucial to exclude unrelated diagnoses like asthma. Alright, let's prepare the final response focusing just on the essential information.",

    "vignette":"Only upon the repeated and fervent insistence of her parents did 19-year-old Emily reluctantly agree to see a psychiatrist. \u201cIt\u2019s not me you want to see,\u201d Emily proclaimed emphatically. \u201cIt\u2019s my insane parents who need your help.\u201d Emily did not offer a chief complaint, aside from the concern that her parents were driving her \u201ccrazy.\u201d She added, \u201cEverything is going great in my life. I have plenty of friends, go out almost every night, and always have lots of fun.\u201d\n\nWhile Emily was taking some time away from \u201cthe so-called real world,\u201d her sister was attending Duke University, her younger brother was excelling at a competitive private high school, and both her parents seemed to enjoy their careers as radiologists. She asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s enough strivers for one family?\u201d\n\nEmily agreed to have her parents join the session, and they told a different story. They tearfully disclosed that their daughter had become irritable, unproductive, and oppositional. She drank to intoxication almost every night, often not returning home for an entire weekend. In searching her room, they had found small amounts of marijuana, alprazolam (Xanax), cocaine, and prescription stimulants. The parents described the changes in Emily\u2019s personality as \u201can adolescent nightmare\u201d and described her friends as \u201closers who do nothing but dye their hair, get tattoos, and hate everything.\u201d Emily\u2019s attitudes and behavior contrasted markedly with those of her parents and siblings. \u201cWe don\u2019t mind that she is doing her own thing and that she isn\u2019t conservative like the rest of us,\u201d her father said, \u201cbut it\u2019s like we don\u2019t even recognize who she\u2019s become.\u201d\n\nAccording to her parents, Emily\u2019s \u201cadolescent nightmare\u201d began 4 years earlier. She had apparently been a studious 15-year-old girl with a lively sense of humor and a wide circle of \u201cterrific friends.\u201d \u201cAlmost overnight,\u201d she began to shun her longtime friends in favor of \u201cdropouts and malcontents\u201d and began to accumulate traffic tickets and school detentions. Instead of her former bright-eyed curiosity, Emily manifested a lack of interest in all her academic subjects, and her grades dropped from As to Ds. The parents were at an absolute loss to explain the sudden and dramatic change.\n\nThe abrupt change in performance led the psychiatrist to ask Emily to take a battery of neuropsychological tests so the results could be compared with those of tests that she had taken when she had applied to a private high school several years earlier. In particular, Emily retook two high school admissions tests: the System for Assessment and Group Evaluation (SAGE), which measures a broad array of academic and perceptual aptitudes, and the Differential Aptitude Tests (DAT), which focus on reasoning, spelling, and perceptual skills.\n\nOn the SAGE, her average percentile scores dropped from the upper 10% for a 13-year-old to the bottom 10% for an adult (and the bottom 20% for a 13-year-old). When Emily took the DAT at age 13, she scored in the highest range for ninth graders across almost all measures. Her worst result had been in spelling, where she scored at the second-highest level. Upon repeating the test at age 19, she scored below the high school average in all measures.\n\nEEG, brain CT, and T2-weighted brain MRI scans showed no evidence of structural brain damage. However, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) T2-weighted MRI displayed a clear lesion in the left frontal cortex, highly suggestive of previous injury to that region.\n\nUpon further questioning about the crucial period in which she seemed to have changed, Emily admitted to being in a traffic accident with her now ex-boyfriend, Mark. Although Emily did not recall much from this episode, she remembered that she hit her head and that she had bad headaches for many weeks thereafter. Because Emily was not bleeding and there was no damage to the car, neither Mark nor Emily reported the incident to anyone. With Emily\u2019s permission, the psychiatrist contacted Mark, who was away at college but a willing and excellent historian. He remembered the incident well. \u201cEmily hit her head very, very hard on the dashboard of my car. She was not totally unconscious but very dazed. For about 3 hours, she spoke very slowly, complained that her head hurt badly, and was confused. For about 2 hours she didn\u2019t know where she was or what day it was. She also threw up twice. I was really scared, but Emily didn\u2019t want me to worry her parents since they\u2019re so overprotective. And then she broke up with me, and we\u2019ve hardly spoken since.\u201d",

    "model_thoughts":"**Analyzing major NCD causes**\n\nI\u2019m checking for the major non-communicable diseases related to traumatic brain injury (TBI). It looks like key conditions include major NCD due to TBI, alcohol use disorder, stimulant use disorder, sedative\/anxiolytic use disorder, and cannabis use disorder. I wonder if we should replace one of the substance use disorders with personality change due to another medical condition. It seems the primary focus involves frontal lobe injury leading to personality change and cognitive decline. So, I\u2019d prioritize major NCD due to TBI and personality change as significant findings.\n\n**Considering psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a clinical case vignette and need to provide proper DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses. Major NCD due to TBI qualifies, along with various substance use disorders and personality change due to another medical condition (F07.0). I wonder if it\u2019s okay to diagnose both major NCD due to TBI and personality change, since DSM guidelines suggest multiple diagnoses when criteria are met. However, if the personality changes stem from the NCD due to TBI, it might explain her symptoms better.\n\n**Evaluating personality changes**\n\nThe case might suggest a \"personality change due to head injury\" instead of a major neurocognitive disorder (NCD), especially since it includes signs of neuropsychological decline and lesions. However, behavioral and personality issues are central. The cognitive decline is emphasized through testing, potentially highlighting how a frontal lobe lesion can result in deficits and disinhibition. If the main diagnosis is major neurocognitive disorder due to TBI, then personality change might be redundant, since NCD would cover both cognitive and behavioral aspects.\n\n**Listing likely diagnoses**\n\nIt seems that personality change can be diagnosed as a persistent disturbance if it represents a shift from someone\u2019s typical personality. This is not confined to cognitive deficits and may occur following head trauma. With major NCD due to TBI, cognitive decline is required, and personality change could coexist if it\u2019s the primary issue. The user requested the top five most plausible diagnoses, including primary and secondary ones, and they indicated that it\u2019s fine if some are just rule-outs. I\u2019ll include personality change as a secondary diagnosis or differential option.\n\n**Determining appropriate diagnoses**\n\nThe primary diagnosis might be \"Personality change due to another medical condition\" specifically regarding traumatic brain injury (F07.0). Alternatively, cognitive decline could suggest \"Major neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury.\" The emphasis on cognitive decline might point toward major NCD since it could involve young individuals. However, I need to be cautious about labeling it as major NCD if cognitive deficits aren\u2019t significantly impairing independence. The user insists on using F-codes, leading to considerations of appropriate listings, including potentially mild cognitive disorder (F06.7) as a valid option.\n\n**Listing possible diagnoses**\n\nI'm considering major neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury (F02.81) as the primary diagnosis due to significant cognitive decline and behavioral disturbances. Another possibility is personality change due to another medical condition related to the same injury (F07.0). Alcohol use disorder (F10.20) seems severe based on reported nightly use. For cannabis, I might go with F12.10 or possibly F12.20, but it's uncertain. Lastly, I could consider cocaine use disorder (F14.10) or sedative\/hypnotic use disorder (F13.10). Each diagnosis will correspond to the required F-codes.\n\n**Narrowing down diagnoses**\n\nI think I can include sedative or anxiolytic use disorder due to the presence of alprazolam, although there might be incidental use of other substances. Cocaine and prescription stimulants could imply misuse, and I wonder if we should include an unspecified substance use disorder. However, the user is asking for just the top five diagnoses. \n\nTherefore, I'll likely list the following:  \n1. Major neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury (F02.81)  \n2. Personality change due to another medical condition (F07.0)  \n3. Alcohol use disorder (F10.20)  \n4. Cannabis use disorder (F12.10)  \n5. Stimulant use disorder (cocaine) (F14.10).  \nThis selection captures the most relevant concerns given the evidence.\n\n**Determining diagnoses**\n\nI need to ensure that I'm adhering to the rubric while also following the requirement to perform at a high level without explicitly showing my reasoning in the output. It seems that including personality change is important, but it might be redundant if major NCD due to TBI is primary. However, both diagnoses could coexist since they describe different aspects.  \n\nSo, I will likely prioritize the major NCD diagnosis and include secondary substance use disorders without redundancy. Finally, I\u2019m considering including:  \n1. Major neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury - F02.81  \n2. Alcohol use disorder - F10.20  \n3. Cannabis use disorder - F12.10  \n4. Cocaine use disorder - F14.10  \n5. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder - F13.10.\n\n**Clarifying diagnoses**\n\nOkay, major neurocognitive disorder seems like a solid option as a diagnosis here. I\u2019m considering \"Personality change due to another medical condition\" as primary because her cognitive decline shows clear personality changes, potentially due to a frontal lobe injury.  \n\nHowever, I could list \"Mild neurocognitive disorder\" as well. I realize that post-concussional syndrome may relate but isn\u2019t specifically mentioned in DSM-5. My final thoughts lean towards listing:  \n\n1. Major neurocognitive disorder due to TBI  \n2. Alcohol use disorder  \n3. Cannabis use disorder  \n4. Sedative\/hypnotic use disorder  \n5. Cocaine use disorder.  \n\nI might consider whether personality change needs to be included as a differential reasoning instead.\n\n**Listing psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nBased on the information provided, here\u2019s the structured list of the top 5 psychiatric diagnoses with corresponding ICD-10 F-codes:\n\n1. Major neurocognitive disorder due to TBI, with behavioral disturbance - F02.81\n2. Personality change due to another medical condition - F07.0\n3. Alcohol use disorder - F10.20\n4. Stimulant use disorder (cocaine) - F14.10\n5. Cannabis use disorder - F12.10 \n\nThis list reflects the most likely conditions related to the case without accounting for less certain diagnoses.\n\n**Analyzing substance disorders**\n\nI\u2019m considering the proper diagnosed categories for the substances involved, potentially leading to diagnoses under \u201cStimulant-related disorders\u201d and \u201cCannabis use disorder.\u201d It seems reasonable to suspect multiple substance use disorders based on the presented behaviors.\n\nThe final top 5 diagnoses to list would be:\n1. Major neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury, with behavioral disturbance - F02.81.\n2. Personality change due to another medical condition - F07.0.\n3. Alcohol use disorder - F10.20.\n4. Cannabis use disorder - F12.10.\n5. Cocaine use disorder - F14.10. \n\nI\u2019m weighing the severity for alcohol, but F10.20 seems appropriate based on her likely criteria met.\n\n**Deciding on substance use diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to appropriately code alcohol use disorder and explore severity options. It seems the best choice is to use F10.20 for moderate alcohol use disorder, as her behaviors suggest this is reasonable. For cannabis and cocaine, I\u2019m leaning towards mild use, possibly coding them as F12.10 and F14.10. \n\nGiven the details, my final top five diagnoses might be:\n1. Major neurocognitive disorder due to TBI with behavioral disturbance - F02.81.\n2. Alcohol use disorder - F10.20.\n3. Stimulant use disorder (cocaine) - F14.10.\n4. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder - F15.10.\n5. Cannabis use disorder - F12.10. \n\nThis selection seems suitable based on the context!\n\n**Assessing personality change diagnosis**\n\nI think including personality change due to another medical condition is important since there's evidence of a significant shift from Emily's previous personality. I need to analyze if it meets DSM criteria. The changes have been persistent and are not fully explained by other mental disorders. However, if we diagnose major neurocognitive disorder (NCD) due to TBI, there might be overlap. \n\nBased on the evidence, my top five diagnoses could include:\n\n1. Major neurocognitive disorder due to TBI, with behavioral disturbance - F02.81.\n2. Alcohol use disorder - F10.20.\n3. Other stimulant use disorder (including cocaine) - F15.20.\n4. Cannabis use disorder - F12.10.\n5. Perhaps personality change due to another medical condition. \n\nThis list reflects both neurological and psychological factors!\n\n**Analyzing substance use disorders**\n\nI'm looking into the potential diagnoses I can include here. The primary focus is on major neurocognitive disorder due to TBI, but I wonder how this intersects with substance use disorders like alcohol and stimulants.\n\nI realize I have to clarify which codes to use without overdiagnosing. For alcohol use, F10.20 seems solid, but stimulant use is trickier. I can go with F14.10 for cocaine and F15.10 for other stimulants. \n\nFinally, the diagnosis list could include:\n\n1. Major neurocognitive disorder - F02.81\n2. Alcohol use disorder - F10.20\n3. Stimulant use disorder (cocaine) - F14.10\n4. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder - F13.10\n5. Cannabis use disorder - F12.10\n\nThis way, I\u2019m avoiding redundancy and keeping a balanced list!\n\n**Finalizing psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI'm sorting through the potential F codes for diagnoses. The primary diagnosis would be \"Major neurocognitive disorder due to TBI, with behavioral disturbance\" - F02.81. \n\nFor secondary diagnoses, I consider including personality change - F07.0, as it aligns with the history of the personality shift. Then there's alcohol use disorder - F10.20, cannabis use disorder - F12.10, and stimulant (cocaine) use disorder - F14.10. \n\nUltimately, I'm leaning towards this balanced list that captures the main issues:\n\n1. Major neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury, with behavioral disturbance - F02.81\n2. Personality change due to another medical condition (traumatic brain injury) - F07.0\n3. Alcohol use disorder - F10.20\n4. Cannabis use disorder - F12.10\n5. Cocaine use disorder - F14.10\n\n**Finalizing psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI'm considering the \"Other specified neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury,\" but I think I'm better off sticking to the established names from DSM-5-TR. It\u2019s true the user didn\u2019t specify severity, so I can list the diagnoses without it. \n\nI\u2019ve decided on these entries:\n\n1. Major neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury, with behavioral disturbance - F02.81\n2. Personality change due to another medical condition (traumatic brain injury) - F07.0\n3. Alcohol use disorder - F10.20\n4. Cannabis use disorder - F12.10\n5. Cocaine use disorder - F14.10",

    "vignette":"Lucas Sandahl, a 32-year-old landscape architect, presented to a psychiatrist for help with anger. He came to the office with his wife, the mother of their two young children. The couple agreed that Mr. Sandahl had become \u201calmost impossible to live with.\u201d Mrs. Sandahl reported that although she had always considered her husband \u201chigh-strung,\u201d his outbursts were increasing in both frequency and intensity, and she worried that he would become violent with her.\n\nTheir most recent argument began when Mr. Sandahl came home after a \u201chard day at work\u201d to find that dinner was not ready. When he entered the kitchen and saw his wife sitting at the table reading the newspaper, he \u201cexploded\u201d and launched into a tirade about how \u201cbad\u201d a wife she was. When Mrs. Sandahl tried to explain her own long day, Mr. Sandahl cursed at her and broke glassware and a kitchen chair. Terrified, she ran out of the kitchen, gathered up the toddlers, and left for her mother\u2019s house a few miles away. The next day, she told her husband that he would need to get help immediately or prepare for a divorce.\n\nMr. Sandahl said his \u201cblowups\u201d began in childhood but did not become \u201cproblematic\u201d for him until age 13. At about that time, he started having frequent fights with classmates that would occasionally result in trips to the principal\u2019s office. In between the altercations, he was active socially and a solid student.\n\nMr. Sandahl estimated that he had had approximately four verbal outbursts a week in recent years, generally in response to frustration, unexpected demands, or perceived insults. In addition to these heated verbal tussles, Mr. Sandahl described acts of violence about every 2 months; for example, he threw a computer monitor across the room when it started \u201cacting up,\u201d he kicked a hole in a wall when one of his children would not quit crying, and he destroyed his mobile phone during an argument with his mother. He denied physical fights since his adolescence, although he had nearly come to blows with a neighbor as well as an assortment of strangers and employees. The idea that he might physically hurt someone scared Mr. Sandahl \u201cto the core.\u201d\n\nThese outbursts blighted his relationships with colleagues and romantic partners and led to his decision to start his own landscaping company at age 25. The business had done well, despite his demanding style and \u201chair-trigger\u201d temper that led to high employee turnover.\n\nMr. Sandahl described the episodes as short-lived, reaching a peak within seconds and rarely lasting more than a few minutes. Between episodes, he described himself as feeling \u201cfine.\u201d He had experienced brief periods of depressed mood and increased anxiety, but these had not impaired him significantly and tended to resolve on their own within a week. Mr. Sandahl drank socially, but neither he nor his wife linked the outbursts to the alcohol. He had a history of experimentation with various drugs of abuse, but not in recent years.\n\nMr. Sandahl reported at least two other immediate family members with significant \u201canger issues.\u201d His father was emotionally abusive and perfectionistic, expecting \u201cgreat things\u201d from his only son. Mr. Sandahl\u2019s older sister also had problems with her temper; he attributed her three divorces to her emotionally abusive behavior.\n\nOn examination, Mr. Sandahl was casually dressed, cooperative, and coherent. He was worried about his behavior and contrite toward his wife. He denied depression, psychosis, and confusion. He denied any thoughts of hurting himself or others. He was cognitively intact. His insight and judgment were good during the course of the interview.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Clarifying ICD-10 codes**\n\nI'm checking the ICD-10 code for other specified depressive episodes. I think F32.89 might be relevant, and I also recall that F32.8 refers to other depressive episodes. It seems like using the term \"Other specified depressive disorder\" relates to DSM-5 code 311. I should verify the links between ICD-10 and DSM-5 codes, like F32.8 for both classifications. To add more context, I could explore other codes related to unspecified disorders or personality disorders for differential diagnosis.\n\n**Exploring differential diagnoses**\n\nI'm considering four additional differential diagnoses: Borderline personality disorder, Antisocial personality disorder, Bipolar disorder, and substance-induced issues. I'll evaluate which ones fit the user's pattern. Comparing Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) with personality disorders, I notice that in personality disorders, aggression is more widespread. This individual shows remorse and stable functioning between episodes, suggesting IED is more likely. Additionally, episodes are brief without manic symptoms. I wonder about ADHD and ODD, but since his behavior started in childhood and has continued, it could lead to considering Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder.\n\n**Assessing mood disorders**\n\nI'm thinking about the onset of symptoms, noting that with irritability and frequent temper outbursts, but it seems there isn\u2019t persistent irritability between episodes. The individual's age being 32 leads me to consider \"Mood disorder due to a medical condition,\" but that doesn't apply here. Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) seems clear. For the differential diagnoses, I should consider Bipolar II disorder, Borderline personality disorder, Antisocial personality disorder, and possibly substance-related disorders. Yet, I need to focus on F-coded diagnoses and skip the non-psychiatric ones, even though mild Alcohol use disorder might fit, there's no clear link to the outbursts.\n\n**Evaluating potential diagnoses**\n\nI'm examining the vignette, noting that neither the individual nor his wife seems linked to alcohol, making it less likely that this is a factor. While there was past drug use, it\u2019s been years and not enough to suggest a substance use disorder. I briefly consider \"Stimulant use disorder in sustained remission,\" but it doesn't quite fit. Maybe \"Other specified impulse-control disorder\" could apply, but I doubt it. He may show patterns of \"Other specified depressive disorder,\" but we lack enough frequency and symptoms. Diagnosing an \"Adjustment disorder\" due to work stress also seems unlikely since the outbursts have been long-standing.\n\n**Determining diagnoses**\n\nI'm reviewing possible diagnoses for the user, starting with whether \"Generalized Anxiety Disorder\" might fit, but it seems unlikely. Since the user needs five diagnoses, I plan to treat these as differential diagnoses to satisfy the requirements. I can list conditions like Intermittent Explosive Disorder and various personality disorders. Bipolar disorder is a consideration, but since symptoms don\u2019t fit neatly, I might include unspecified types. Other potential diagnoses like substance use disorders, unspecified depressive or anxiety disorders could relate, but I need to be cautious about their relevance. Ultimately, it\u2019s essential to prioritize those linked to the observed behaviors.\n\n**Evaluating possible diagnoses**\n\nI'm considering various diagnoses for the user. While \"Narcissistic Personality Disorder\" and \"Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder\" don't seem like a good fit, I might look into \"Other Specified Personality Disorder.\" I should also consider the user's history of outbursts since childhood, which ties into IED symptoms. While Bipolar Disorder has been mentioned, it doesn't align well given no hypomanic symptoms. Ultimately, I need five plausible diagnoses, prioritizing those related to impulsivity, emotional regulation, and the user\u2019s overall behavior patterns.\n\n**Assessing differential diagnoses**\n\nI'm considering various secondary diagnoses, but options like \"Unspecified Personality Disorder\" or \"Borderline\/Antisocial Personality Disorder\" may not hold strong support. I could think of alternatives, including \"Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder,\" but I must be careful not to duplicate codes. \n\nLooking back at his substance use history and mood symptoms, no strong criteria for substance use or depressive disorders seem to stand out, which complicates things. Ultimately, I need to list five plausible diagnoses, focusing on his impulsivity, emotional regulation, and overall behavior patterns.\n\n**Formulating differential diagnoses**\n\nI'm considering several potential diagnoses for the user, focusing on conditions like Intermittent Explosive Disorder as primary and then exploring others like Borderline Personality Disorder, Antisocial Personality Disorder, and Bipolar Disorder. However, there's not enough evidence for many of these.\n\nWhile substances like alcohol could factor in, I find that the evidence isn't solid. I must avoid over-diagnosing, ensuring any listed conditions are plausible. Finally, I need to confirm these with proper codes, focusing on those that relate directly to the user's experiences.\n\n**Determining psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI'm navigating through various possible diagnoses, focusing on how to label the user's impulsive anger outbursts, possibly under \"Intermittent Explosive Disorder\" (IED) as the primary diagnosis. I also have to consider differentials, like Borderline and Antisocial Personality Disorders, which aren't well-supported. \n\nI need to ensure that my final list contains the top five most plausible DSM-5-TR diagnoses, including their F-codes, while making sure each is based on solid reasoning from the information provided. Okay, this requires some careful consideration.\n\n**Structuring potential diagnoses**\n\nI'm considering how to approach the list of plausible diagnoses while avoiding those with no supporting evidence. It seems clear that \"Intermittent Explosive Disorder\" (IED) should be the primary diagnosis due to the documented anger outbursts. \n\nThe other possible diagnoses include Borderline Personality Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, and potentially some anxiety or depressive disorders. I need to create a structured list, particularly focusing on those that share symptoms and relevant features, while ensuring my selections are well-supported by the case details provided.\n\n**Evaluating potential diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a case where the individual experiences anger outbursts triggered by frustration or perceived insults. This suggests a sensitivity that could indicate traits of narcissistic injury, but he also shows empathy after these episodes. I'm considering \"Intermittent Explosive Disorder\" (IED) as the primary diagnosis since it fits well.\n\nFor secondary diagnoses, I\u2019m contemplating Borderline Personality Disorder, Antisocial Personality Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, and possibly ADHD. Ultimately, I need to narrow it down to a structured list of the top five most likely diagnoses.\n\n**Choosing possible diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m considering the primary diagnosis as Intermittent Explosive Disorder due to recurrent anger outbursts. For secondary diagnoses, I\u2019m thinking about Borderline Personality Disorder, Antisocial Personality Disorder, and possibly Alcohol Use Disorder, though there\u2019s no evidence for the latter. I\u2019m also contemplating whether to include Unspecified Personality Disorder since his behavior shows some maladaptive traits. Ultimately, I need to provide a final list of the top five most likely diagnoses and their corresponding codes.\n\n**Finalizing possible diagnoses**\n\nI'm considering \"Adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct\" but it doesn't fit the criteria. Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Cyclothymic Disorder don't seem right either. I want to provide Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) as the primary diagnosis and think about potential secondaries that are plausible yet don't misrepresent his condition. Options could include Personality Disorder (Unspecified), or possibly Other Specified Personality Disorder. It's tricky since I don\u2019t want to fabricate, so I\u2019ll choose secondary diagnoses carefully based on his symptomatology.\n\n**Determining final diagnoses**\n\nI'm concluding that IED should be the primary diagnosis since he is functional. For the secondaries, we might consider Bipolar Disorder or Major Depressive Disorder, but those don't fit well. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder seems more applicable since he reports episodes of anxiety, but might not meet the full criteria. \n\nI think we should aim for a structured list of diagnoses. I'm leaning toward: 1. Intermittent Explosive Disorder, 2. Other Specified Personality Disorder, 3. Bipolar II Disorder, 4. Alcohol Use Disorder, and 5. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder. But I'm feeling unsure about including Alcohol Use Disorder.\n\n**Evaluating the diagnosis options**\n\nI'm considering what to include for unspecified anxiety disorder (F41.9) but questioning if it's necessary. IED often coexists with other disorders, like Major Depressive Disorder, but he seems to deny significant impairment. \n\nFor possible differentials, I think of disorders like Borderline and Antisocial Personality Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, and Substance-Induced Mood Disorder, but I need specific F-codes. It's a bit tricky. I\u2019d propose: 1. Intermittent Explosive Disorder, 2. Borderline Personality Disorder, 3. Bipolar II Disorder, 4. Antisocial Personality Disorder, and 5. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder. I'm feeling a bit uncertain, especially about the role of alcohol use here.\n\n**Reviewing differential diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about including \"Other specified bipolar and related disorder\" (F31.89), but I'm unsure. Major Depressive Disorder doesn\u2019t seem appropriate either. Despite considering Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1), his anxiety isn\u2019t persistent enough. I realize I need to clarify the F codes: Intermittent Explosive Disorder (F63.81), Borderline Personality Disorder (F60.3), Antisocial Personality Disorder (F60.2), and Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9) are solid choices. I should ideally list IED as the primary diagnosis and choose four relevant differentials, mindful of accuracy and implications regarding alcohol use.\n\n**Determining diagnoses**\n\nI'm considering \"Bipolar disorder, unspecified\" (F31.9) as a potential diagnosis, but since there's no mania, it might not fit well. Should I include \"Alcohol use disorder, mild\" (F10.10)? The evidence for that isn\u2019t strong, though. I also wondered about \"Other specified bipolar and related disorder\" (F31.89) for mood episodes, but then I come back to the idea that we must limit our choices primarily based on provided information. \n\nThe guidelines request top 5 diagnoses, so including ones like \"Intermittent explosive disorder\" and \"Other specified depressive disorder\" seems a better fit. However, I still need to ensure there's adequate evidence for all selected conditions.\n\n**Evaluating potential disorders**\n\nI\u2019m considering several possible diagnoses based on the information provided. I thought about \"Polysubstance use disorder in sustained remission\" or \"Other psychoactive substance use disorder,\" but without evidence of negative consequences, those don\u2019t fit well. \n\nThe options for secondary diagnoses might include \"Unspecified depressive disorder,\" \"Unspecified anxiety disorder,\" and \"Intermittent explosive disorder.\" I'm unsure about including personality disorders, like \"Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder\" or \"Narcissistic personality disorder,\" because while there are signs of perfectionism and control, I need clearer evidence. \n\nUltimately, I\u2019ll compile an accurate list of diagnoses reflecting the most plausible conditions based on the information available.\n\n**Finalizing diagnoses list**\n\nI\u2019m considering treating the episodes as \"Other specified depressive disorder\" since they resolve quickly. For the top five diagnoses, \"Intermittent explosive disorder\" seems the most likely since there are recurrent outbursts. Next, I'd consider \"Other specified personality disorder\" or even \"Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder.\" \n\nThe first five diagnoses I\u2019ll provide are:  \n1. Intermittent explosive disorder - F63.81  \n2. Other specified personality disorder (prominent impulsive aggression) - F60.89  \n3. Other specified depressive disorder (short-duration depressive episodes) - F32.8  \n4. Other specified anxiety disorder - F41.8  \n5. Bipolar disorder, unspecified - F31.9\n\n**Creating DSM-5 diagnoses list**\n\nI\u2019m mapping the diagnoses to their DSM-5 codes. For the primary conditions, I believe \"Intermittent explosive disorder\" is solid, coded as F63.81. Following that, I\u2019ll list \"Other specified personality disorder\" (F60.89), and next is \"Other specified anxiety disorder\" (F41.8). I\u2019ll also include \"Other specified depressive disorder\" (F32.8) and finally \"Bipolar disorder, unspecified\" (F31.9). \n\nSo the final list appears as:  \n1. Intermittent explosive disorder - F63.81  \n2. Other specified personality disorder - F60.89  \n3. Other specified anxiety disorder - F41.8  \n4. Other specified depressive disorder - F32.8  \n5. Bipolar disorder, unspecified - F31.9\n\n**Finalizing DSM-5 diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m debating between different ICD-10 codes, like F32.8 for \"Other specified depressive disorder\" or the newer F32.A for \"Unspecified depressive disorder.\" It's tricky because F32.A isn't strictly numeric due to the letter A, so F32.8 might avoid confusion. Ultimately, I\u2019ll list the final diagnoses, including \"Intermittent explosive disorder\" (F63.81), \"Other specified personality disorder\" (F60.89), \"Other specified anxiety disorder\" (F41.8), \"Other specified depressive disorder\" (F32.8), and \"Bipolar disorder, unspecified\" (F31.9). I\u2019ll rank them by likelihood and relevance based on symptoms while ensuring they fit the case!\n\n**Determining secondary diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about the most appropriate secondary diagnoses given the initial information. While \u201cexperimentation with various drugs\u201d might suggest some substance issues, I believe it\u2019s best to avoid labeling \"Other psychoactive substance use disorder\" since there's not enough evidence. We have three established: \"Other specified personality disorder,\" \"Other specified anxiety disorder,\" and \"Other specified depressive disorder.\" I need to find one more. Options like \"Adjustment disorder\" or \"Oppositional defiant disorder\" come to mind, but without sufficient support, I\u2019ll take a conservative approach and focus on diagnoses that better align with the current symptoms.\n\n**Finalizing differential diagnoses**\n\nI need to create a list of 5 differential diagnoses, even if they aren't fully supported. It seems reasonable to include conditions that align with features observed, such as impulsive aggression. I\u2019m considering including \"Intermittent explosive disorder\" as primary, plus, possibly \"Borderline personality disorder,\" and \"Bipolar disorder.\" I'm leaning toward \"Substance-induced aggression\" due to past social drinking. Ultimately, I\u2019ll include plausible options based on the evidence, focusing on those that fit the symptoms presented while being cognizant of the need for accuracy.\n\n**Finalizing diagnoses list**\n\nI\u2019m deciding on the final five differential diagnoses. I think including \"Intermittent explosive disorder\" as primary makes sense. Then, \"Borderline personality disorder\" seems plausible, along with \"Other specified anxiety disorder\" and \"Other specified depressive disorder.\" Finally, I\u2019m weighing whether to include \"Antisocial personality disorder,\" but the evidence isn\u2019t as strong. Ultimately, this could shape our final list, ensuring we're focusing on the most relevant conditions based on the symptoms presented and available information.\n\n**Finalizing diagnosis list**\n\nI\u2019m considering \"Cyclothymic disorder,\" but it doesn't fit well. \"Bipolar II disorder\" also doesn\u2019t work because he doesn't have major depressive episodes. However, \"Other specified bipolar disorder\" doesn\u2019t apply either. The mood symptoms just aren't sufficient for a diagnosis. After verifying \"Intermittent explosive disorder,\" I can confirm it meets the criteria. Now, I need to list exactly five diagnoses with their corresponding codes, formatted correctly. Let\u2019s finalize that list!",

    "vignette":"J is a mid-20s military service member living independently in the community with a partner. J has a history of multiple ACEs (ACE scale score of 10\/10), with caregivers that were both physically and emotionally abusive when J's needs were voiced, resulting in a belief that it was unacceptable, unsafe, and futile to resolve interpersonal problems with caregivers, thus creating a sense of powerlessness and helplessness. Child and family services were never involved, and no legal charges were ever laid against the family for the abuse that J endured. J struggled with containing anger since early childhood resulting in physical and verbal aggression towards peers and teachers at school and family members at home. Caregivers attempted to contain J's aggressive behavior through forced administration of psychiatric medication. While growing up, J feared others and preferred to be alone, despite longing for family and friends. Socialization with peers proved difficult, as J was easily overwhelmed by noise associated with social contact and was frequently ridiculed or misunderstood while trying to verbally communicate.\n\nAs a young adult, J left family to enter the military, which became an immediate source of attachment and social belonging. More recently, J became increasingly unable to cope with anger following an ill-suited work position and a musculoskeletal injury, resulting in frequent angry verbal altercations and threats of violence towards military peers who placed restrictions on his activities. This led to disciplinary action and isolation from the unit, which further increased anger, hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts and led to a psychiatric military assessment. During the assessment, J disclosed feelings of intense anger which eventually manifested in an attack on a family member in an amnestic dissociated state. J's history indicated that pharmacological treatments had either been ineffective or caused significant side effects. The military psychiatrist determined J ought to be considered for military discharge. This triggered flashbacks of past childhood abuse and a significant increase in rage. J refused trials of psychiatric medications in the community due to a childhood history of forced medication administration. Due to significant safety concerns and limited ability to control aggressive behavior in the community, J's military psychiatrist referred J for an inpatient admission.\n\nOn initial assessment for admission, J appeared distrustful, angry, and concerned about acting out on anger and expressed suicidal ideation. On mental status examination, J was tall and appeared neatly dressed in a military uniform. J appeared hypervigilant and intensely watchful and was well spoken, using a \u201csharp\u201d tone of voice. J provided a detailed history, demonstrating a goal-directed thought form and a high level of abstract thinking, logical analysis, and good recall. There were no delusions or hallucinations, but J endorsed prominent active suicidal ideation, with intent to act upon these thoughts if not hospitalized; however, there were no immediate, specific suicide plans.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Identifying diagnoses and codes**\n\nI need to outline the top five DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses along with their ICD-10 F-codes based on a specific case. The details describe a 12-month-old infant with various dysmorphic features, which suggests Cri-du-chat syndrome\u2014a genetic condition linked to intellectual disability. The appropriate DSM-5 diagnosis for someone this young would likely be \"Global developmental delay\" with code F88. I also note other possible relevant diagnoses like \"Neurodevelopmental disorder\" also linked to the genetic condition. Codes F70-F79 and F78 may apply here too.\n\n**Clarifying diagnoses and codes**\n\nI\u2019m realizing that F78 refers to other intellectual disabilities, while the DSM-5-TR lists specific codes. For global developmental delay, the code is 315.8 (F88), and for unspecified intellectual disability, it\u2019s 319 (F79). Considering the case, the primary diagnosis likely revolves around global developmental delay due to a suspected genetic syndrome like Cri-du-chat. However, since I shouldn't include non-psychiatric diagnoses, I can't list it. With feeding difficulties and hypothonia, it seems challenging to identify a definite psychiatric diagnosis for a 12-month-old.\n\n**Determining appropriate diagnoses**\n\nIn DSM-5 terms, for a child under five, if developmental milestones aren't met and severity can't be reliably assessed, we should use \"global developmental delay.\" However, since explicit delays aren't noted, it\u2019s tricky. At 12 months, hypotonia suggests potential motor delays, but I can't fabricate details. I could suggest \"Other specified neurodevelopmental disorder\" if data is insufficient. The vignette highlights physical congenital anomalies and doesn\u2019t mention cognitive deficits. I wonder if \"Feeding and eating disorder of infancy\/early childhood\" could fit among the top five likely diagnoses.\n\n**Evaluating potential diagnoses**\n\nThe infant's feeding problems requiring a gastroenterologist since birth could indicate difficulties with feeding, possibly leading to avoidant\/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID). Since he had low birth weight, ARFID might apply if he struggles to meet nutritional needs. However, we need to be careful not to include conditions like Pica, and \"Reactive attachment disorder\" seems unlikely without maltreatment. Looking at \"Separation anxiety disorder,\" it's normal for that age, so that wouldn\u2019t apply. It seems like \"Global developmental delay\" and \"Other specified feeding or eating disorder\" could be the best fits.\n\n**Listing diagnoses and F-codes**\n\nThe user requests a structured list of diagnoses with corresponding F-codes, so I need to present just the diagnoses without the reasoning. I\u2019ll include:\n\n1. Global developmental delay - F88.\n2. Avoidant\/restrictive food intake disorder - F50.82.\n3. Unspecified intellectual developmental disorder - F79 (if further information supports this).\n4. Autism spectrum disorder - F84.0 (to consider as a possibility).\n5. Separation anxiety disorder - F93.0 (if the crying when left alone is excessive). \n\nThis gives a clear overview of potential diagnoses based on the information provided!\n\n**Structuring top diagnoses**\n\nI need to compile a structured list of the top 5 DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses along with their corresponding F-codes. It\u2019s a bit tricky because the infant has several complex issues, but here\u2019s how I think it should go:\n\n1. Global developmental delay - F88.\n2. Unspecified intellectual developmental disorder - F79 (considering eventual ID).\n3. Avoidant\/restrictive food intake disorder - F50.82 (due to feeding issues).\n4. Autism spectrum disorder - F84.0 (possible due to neurogenetic syndrome).\n5. I still need to finalize a fifth diagnosis, but there's a lot to consider!\n\n**Finalizing diagnoses**\n\nFor this case, I'm looking to identify the top 5 psychiatric diagnoses according to DSM-5-TR, noting that we need to be careful not to fabricate details. \n\n1. Global developmental delay - F88 (since this seems the most appropriate).\n2. Unspecified neurodevelopmental disorder - F89 (to capture additional concerns).\n3. Avoidant\/restrictive food intake disorder - F50.82 (feeding issues).\n4. Unspecified intellectual developmental disorder - F79 (potential future diagnosis).\n5. Autism spectrum disorder - F84.0 (pending further evaluation).\n\nThe information supports these choices, given the weighted factors!\n\n**Listing the diagnoses**\n\nTo structure the top 5 most likely diagnoses based on the details provided, I will list them as follows:\n\n1. Global developmental delay - F88  \n2. Avoidant\/restrictive food intake disorder - F50.82  \n3. Unspecified intellectual developmental disorder - F79  \n4. Autism spectrum disorder - F84.0  \n5. Unspecified neurodevelopmental disorder - F89  \n\nThis setup maintains the required format and aligns with the classification per DSM-5-TR without including any unnecessary reasoning.\n\n**Finalizing the diagnoses**\n\nThe user needs a structured list of the likely diagnoses. The child's crying when left alone isn't likely due to pathology but a laryngeal issue, so I\u2019ll focus on neurodevelopmental ones. \n\nI\u2019ll list Global Developmental Delay (GDD) as primary, followed by Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID), Unspecified Intellectual Developmental Disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and lastly, Unspecified Neurodevelopmental Disorder as differential options. This keeps things organized and clear!",

    "vignette":"Olivia Jacobs, a 22-year-old graduate student in architecture, was referred for an urgent psychiatric consultation after she told her roommate that she was suicidal. Ms. Jacobs had a history of mood symptoms that had been under good control with lithium and sertraline, but her depressive symptoms had returned soon after she had arrived in a new city for school, 3 months earlier. She had become preoccupied with ways in which she might kill herself without inconveniencing others. Her dominant suicidal thoughts involved shooting herself in the head while leaning out the window, so as not to cause a mess in the dorm. Although she did not have access to a gun, she spent time searching the Web for places where she might purchase one.\n\nMs. Jacobs\u2019s psychiatric history began at age 15, when she began to regularly drink alcohol and smoke marijuana, usually when out at dance clubs with friends. Both of these substances calmed her, and she denied that either had become problematic. She had used neither alcohol nor marijuana since starting graduate school.\n\nAround age 17, she began experiencing brief, intense depressive episodes, marked by tearfulness, feelings of guilt, anhedonia, hopelessness, low energy, and poor concentration. She would sleep more than 12 hours a day and neglect responsibilities at school and home.\n\nThese depressive episodes would generally shift after a few weeks into periods of increased energy, pressured speech, and unusual creativity. She would stay up most of the night working on projects and building architectural models. These revved-up episodes lasted about 5 days and were punctuated by feelings that her friends had turned against her and that they were not really friends at all. Worried especially about the paranoia, her family had brought her to a psychiatrist, who diagnosed her as having bipolar II disorder and prescribed lithium and sertraline. Although Ms. Jacobs\u2019s moods did not completely stabilize on this regimen, she did well enough at a local university to be accepted into a prestigious graduate program far from home. At that point the depression returned, and she became intensely suicidal for the first time.\n\nUpon evaluation, the patient was visibly depressed and tearful, and had psychomotor slowing. She said it was very difficult to get out of bed and she was not attending class most days. She reported hopelessness, poor concentration, and guilt about spending family money for school when she was not able to perform. She stated that she thought about suicide most of the time and that she had found nothing to distract her. She denied recent drinking or smoking marijuana, stating she did not feel like \u201cpartying.\u201d She acknowledged profound feelings of emptiness and indicated that she had occasionally cut her arms superficially to \u201csee what it would feel like.\u201d She stated that she knew that cutting herself in this way would not kill her. She reported depersonalization and occasional panic attacks. She denied having mood instability, derealization, problems with impulsivity, concerns about her identity, and fears of abandonment.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Clarifying diagnosis output**\n\nI need to focus on the request for F-codes. Some differential diagnoses do have F-codes, so I can include those. However, I have to be careful not to contradict myself. They want the top 5 diagnoses, which can include differential ones, but they\u2019re asking for a specific structure without any reasoning. I\u2019ll have to provide a prioritized list of diagnoses with corresponding F-codes, ensuring it aligns with their instruction.\n\n**Evaluating depressive and hypomanic criteria**\n\nI'm analyzing the evidence for the user's case. She meets the criteria for a major depressive episode due to symptoms lasting over two weeks, including suicidal ideation and low energy. Additionally, she has a history of hypomanic episodes, showing increased energy and pressured speech lasting about five days. Hypomanic criteria indicate she has enough symptoms, like decreased sleep and increased goal-directed activity, to suggest a significant episode. So, I should consider both conditions when assessing her situation.\n\n**Assessing mood and potential disorders**\n\nThe mood is characterized by increased energy and unusual creativity for about five days, suggesting a likely hypomanic episode. This aligns with a bipolar II disorder diagnosis, especially since there's no marked impairment or psychosis. Treatment might involve lithium and sertraline, noting SSRIs can sometimes trigger mania, but she has had prior episodes. \n\nHowever, she's experiencing feelings of emptiness, superficial cutting, and panic that point to possible borderline personality disorder. While she denies key features, I shouldn't assume anything. The DSM criteria require five out of nine features, and she meets some of these, like chronic emptiness and self-mutilation.\n\n**Analyzing mood and diagnoses**\n\nShe denies experiencing mood instability, but her episodic mood changes seem related to bipolar. Although she doesn\u2019t claim fears of abandonment, identity disturbance, or impulsivity, I see 3-4 criteria that align with borderline features, like self-harm and feelings of emptiness. This isn't enough for a full borderline personality disorder (BPD) diagnosis, but there could be other specified personality disorders at play. \n\nIt's tricky because her symptoms can overlap with both bipolar II and BPD. While she reports depressive episodes that shift into heightened energy and creativity, possibly indicating hypomania, her overall denial of instability makes it complex. I\u2019ll need to dig even deeper to clarify her situation.\n\n**Determining potential diagnoses**\n\nIn this case, mood swings associated with BPD are typically rapid and reactive, which doesn\u2019t seem to fit here as her patterns indicate bipolar II disorder due to longer episodes of depression and increased energy. Although she shows some borderline traits like self-harm and emptiness, she denies key features like impulsivity. \n\nWe need to prioritize the top 5 most likely diagnoses while focusing on accurate coding. Based on her symptoms, bipolar II disorder seems most plausible, followed by potential supporting diagnoses like major depressive disorder and anxiety-related issues. For accuracy, we'll assign F-codes based on the information given, avoiding fabrication and ensuring we provide a structured list.\n\n**Listing potential diagnoses**\n\nI need to carefully compile the top 5 diagnoses based on the provided symptoms without including unsupported elements. Starting with Bipolar II disorder (F31.81) as the primary diagnosis, followed by Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe (F33.2) as an alternative. \n\nNext, I suggest Borderline personality disorder (F60.3) for relevant traits and symptoms, then Panic disorder (F41.0) or Other specified anxiety disorder (F41.8) for the panic attacks. Lastly, I'd include Depersonalization\/derealization disorder (F48.1) or possibly Other specified dissociative disorder (F44.89).\n\n**Finalizing the diagnosis list**\n\nI\u2019m considering the diagnoses for this case. The primary diagnosis could be \"Bipolar II disorder, current episode depressed\" (F31.81). I also see value in including \"Other specified personality disorder (borderline features)\" (F60.89) because she has some traits, though not all criteria are met. Another could be \"Depersonalization\/derealization disorder\" (F48.1 or F44.89), followed by \"Other specified anxiety disorder\" (F41.8) for her panic attacks. Lastly, I might include \"Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe without psychotic features\" (F33.2) as a differential.\n\n**Choosing diagnoses carefully**\n\nI\u2019m assessing diagnoses for the case. The primary seems to be \"Bipolar II disorder\" (F31.81) because of her episodes. For secondary options, I might include \"Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe\" (F33.2) as a differential but not as a standalone. \"Borderline personality disorder\" (F60.3) could be considered due to certain traits, although she denies fully meeting the criteria. I\u2019ll also list \"Panic disorder\" (F41.0) and \"Depersonalization\/derealization disorder\" (F48.1). These selections reflect her symptoms without fabricating details.\n\n**Refining potential diagnoses**\n\nI need to pick the top five diagnoses based on the information presented, even if not all are fully confirmed. I think \"Bipolar II disorder, current episode depressed\" (F31.81) is strongly supported. I\u2019m also considering \"Borderline personality disorder\" (F60.3) for some traits she exhibits, plus \"Depersonalization\/derealization disorder\" (F48.1) and \"Panic disorder\" (F41.0) for possible anxiety-related issues. Finally, I can include \"Major depressive disorder, recurrent\" (F33.2) as a plausible alternative. These choices reflect the symptoms accurately without misrepresentation.\n\n**Analyzing potential diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out the best diagnoses for the symptoms described. It's likely she has \"Bipolar II disorder\" as the primary diagnosis, but I\u2019m considering additional traits that might suggest \"Borderline personality disorder.\" The timeline shows brief not unambiguous episodes that could indicate hypomania with some paranoia. We also know she has severe depression and suicidal ideation, which complicates the picture. I\u2019m looking to select four secondary diagnoses, including \"Major depressive disorder\" as a differential, along with traits that suggest possible personality disorders or panic.\n\n**Finalizing diagnoses options**\n\nI\u2019m weighing possible diagnoses, starting with \"Bipolar II disorder\" as the primary option and considering \"Major depressive disorder\" as a secondary diagnosis, especially with suicidal behavior being significant. Other options include \"Borderline personality disorder\" though it may not fully fit; features like emptiness and self-harm also reflect other disorders. I\u2019m debating the inclusion of \"Panic disorder\" and \"Depersonalization\/derealization disorder\" as they show symptoms, but it seems clearer now. My list so far includes plausible choices that capture the complexities here while ensuring proper formatting for clarity!\n\n**Finalizing potential diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m narrowing down the diagnoses, starting with \"Bipolar II disorder\" as the primary option. For secondary diagnoses, I\u2019m considering \"Major depressive disorder\" and \"Other specified personality disorder\" due to some borderline features. \"Depersonalization\/derealization disorder\" might be included since she reports depersonalization, even if it\u2019s not persistent. \"Other specified anxiety disorder\" could also fit, given the panic attacks. Overall, I want a clear list, ensuring it meets the instruction for primary and four secondary diagnoses!\n\n**Crafting the final diagnosis list**\n\nI'm considering including \"Bipolar I disorder\" or \"Schizoaffective disorder\" as differentials, but they don't seem to fit well here. I need to finalize the top five likely diagnoses, focusing on \"Bipolar II disorder,\" \"Major depressive disorder,\" and \"Borderline personality disorder.\" I realize I want to highlight \"Panic disorder\" and \"Depersonalization\/derealization disorder\" too.\n\nI\u2019ll ensure the ICD-10 codes are right and keep it straightforward without unnecessary complexity. It\u2019s crucial to present everything clearly, like this:\n\n1. Bipolar II disorder - F31.81. \n2. Borderline personality disorder - F60.3. \n3. Major depressive disorder - F33.2. \n4. Panic disorder - F41.0. \n5. Depersonalization\/derealization disorder - F48.1. \n\nThis list should encapsulate the relevant information!\n\n**Finalizing diagnosis list**\n\nI need to finalize the top five likely diagnoses along with their ICD-10 codes. I think the final list should include:\n\n1. Bipolar II disorder, current episode depressed - F31.81.\n2. Other specified personality disorder (borderline traits) - F60.89.\n3. Other specified anxiety disorder (panic attacks) - F41.8.\n4. Depersonalization\/derealization disorder - F48.1.\n5.

    "model_thoughts":"**Gathering symptoms for assessment**\n\nI'm evaluating some symptoms here. The aggressive physical behavior in school, like slapping classmates and fighting, really stands out. There are frequent tantrums and outbursts, occurring multiple times a week, paired with general irritability and blaming others without taking accountability. This behavior seems related to conditions like Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) and Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD). I also wonder if it could relate to ADHD or other impulse-control disorders. There\u2019s definitely a lot to consider!\n\n**Assessing potential disorders**\n\nI'm outlining some potential diagnoses here. We've got Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) and Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) as strong contenders. I\u2019m also considering Intermittent Explosive Disorder, ADHD (combined presentation), and Conduct Disorder. Conduct Disorder seems plausible based on aggression and physical altercations, but the criteria aren\u2019t fully met; still, it\u2019s worth mentioning. We could also look at unspecified impulse-control disorders since details are a bit lacking. Yet, focusing on DMDD and ODD feels more accurate given the aggressive behavior patterns.\n\n**Evaluating potential diagnoses**\n\nI'm considering \"Intermittent Explosive Disorder\" as an option since it involves impulse control. But Conduct Disorder has a persistent pattern of violating rights, which isn't entirely clear here. I could also mention \"Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder\" if the criteria for ODD or Conduct Disorder aren't fully met, though that feels a bit redundant with what we've already noted. It makes sense to rank these: DMDD first, then ODD, ADHD, IED, and potentially Conduct Disorder. ADHD symptoms might not fully meet the criteria, but IED seems stronger due to the outbursts, even if DMDD is also present. However, I think focusing on diagnoses is key here.\n\n**Determining diagnoses criteria**\n\nI'm being instructed to provide the top five likely diagnoses, starting with a primary option and four secondary ones. This means I need to pick the best-fit primary diagnosis and include plausible alternatives. Now, regarding DMDD and ODD: if DMDD is present, ODD can't be, but I can still mention it as an alternative. ADHD is comorbid with DMDD, which is straightforward, but IED can't coexist. Conduct Disorder can be comorbid, as DSM-5 allows DMDD to be seen alongside several other disorders except ODD, IED, and bipolar. So, if DMDD is primary, mentioning ODD and IED as secondary diagnoses could lead to issues with comorbidity rules, but it's fine to note them as differential diagnoses.\n\n**Finalizing top diagnoses**\n\nThe user wants a structured list of diagnoses rather than a differential, but there\u2019s some overlap in what they requested. I\u2019ll compile a top five list, focusing on plausible diagnoses while keeping in mind the necessary ICD-10 codes. My list includes Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder as the primary diagnosis, followed by Oppositional Defiant Disorder, ADHD, Intermittent Explosive Disorder, and Conduct Disorder. I\u2019m considering the timing of symptoms to determine whether to use the childhood-onset code or the unspecified one, ensuring all criteria are met.\n\n**Reviewing likely diagnoses**\n\nI need to clarify the options for the top five psychiatric diagnoses, considering the provided context. \"Unspecified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder\" could be a catch-all, but I\u2019m debating whether to include it since we already have ODD. Given the patient's history, including experiences in foster care, trauma-related diagnoses like \"Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder\" could be relevant. However, I need to ensure we base choices on clear symptoms, and so far, DMDD appears as the primary diagnosis due to frequent outbursts and persistent irritability.\n\n**Assessing diagnostic criteria**\n\nI'm evaluating the diagnostic criteria related to different disorders based on the patient's history. I see that criteria A-D must be present for 12 months, which isn't fully clear due to inconsistent reporting. For ODD, the patient shows four symptoms of angry\/irritable behavior, making it plausible. For IED, recurrent aggressive outbursts occur, suggesting its possibility. However, ADHD doesn\u2019t meet the necessary criteria. I\u2019m balancing the need for specific diagnoses with the uncertainties present, and I might choose \"Other specified disruptive, impulse-control disorder\" as the fifth option.\n\n**Listing potential diagnoses**\n\nI'm considering diagnoses for a patient whose situation involves disruptive behaviors and emotional concerns. I've decided on a list: \n\n1. Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder - F34.81  \n2. Oppositional Defiant Disorder - F91.3  \n3. Intermittent Explosive Disorder - F63.81  \n4. Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder, Combined Presentation - F90.2  \n5. Conduct Disorder, Unspecified Onset - F91.9  \n\nHowever, there may be alternative options like \"Other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder\" or \"Adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct\" based on further evaluation.\n\n**Finalizing psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m looking to finalize a list of psychiatric diagnoses based on the information I have.

The patient frequently punches her mother in the legs, and in the stomach, and the patient even threw her ipad at the pediatrician when she asked the patient what was upsetting her. Most of the patients psychiatric history is gathered from her mother, given how irritable the patient is during the exam.

However, the episodes seem mood-related with a return to baseline. Overall, I\u2019ll focus on mania and disruptive disorders in the top five.\n\n**Identifying Mania Symptoms**\n\nI\u2019m examining signs of mania starting at age 12, like being talkative, energetic, having decreased sleep, impulsiveness, grandiosity, and temper tantrums. This pattern lasted several weeks, followed by months of normal behavior. At 13, there was a hospitalization, and at 14, a recurrence. This clearly suggests episodic mania, likely bipolar I. I considered pediatric bipolar disorder with mixed features but didn\u2019t find depressive symptoms. I think the aggressive behavior indicates a possibility for conduct disorder rather than Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD).\n\n**Assessing Possible Diagnoses**\n\nTo diagnose conduct disorder, there needs to be a repetitive pattern of violations, requiring at least three out of fifteen criteria in the past year. The user has aggression towards her mother and property destruction, suggesting two criteria, but we lack information from other settings to confirm. I considered intermittent explosive disorder (IED), but the impulsive outbursts seem linked to mania and not frequent enough for IED. Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) and Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) also don't fit. So, bipolar I appears to be the most supported diagnosis here.\n\n1. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, with psychotic features - F31.2  \n2. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder - F34.81  \n3. Oppositional defiant disorder - F91.3  \n4. Intermittent explosive disorder - F63.81  \n5. Attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder, combined presentation - F90.2",

    "vignette":"Ashley, age 17, was referred for a diagnostic reevaluation after having carried diagnoses of autism and intellectual disability for almost all of her life. She was recently found to have Kleefstra syndrome, and the family wanted to reconfirm the earlier diagnoses and assess the genetic risk to the future children of her older sisters.\n\nAt the time of the reevaluation, Ashley was attending a special school with a focus on functional skills. She was able to dress herself, but she was not able to shower independently or be left alone in the house. She was able to decode (e.g., read words) and spell at a second-grade level but understood little of what she read. Changes to her schedule and heightened functional expectations tended to make her irritable. When upset, Ashley would often hurt herself (e.g., biting her wrist) and others (e.g., pinching and hair pulling).\n\nIn formal testing done at the time of the reevaluation, Ashley had a nonverbal IQ of 39 and a verbal IQ of 23, with a full scale IQ of 31. Her adaptive scores were somewhat higher, with an overall score of 42 (with 100 as average).\n\nBy history, Ashley first received services at age 9 months after her parents noticed significant motor delays. She walked at 20 months and was toilet trained at 5 years. She spoke her first word at age 6. She received a diagnosis of developmental delay at age 3 and of autism, obesity, and static encephalopathy at age 4. An early evaluation noted possible facial dysmorphology; genetic tests at that time were noncontributory.\n\nHer parents indicated that Ashley knew hundreds of single words and many simple phrases. She had long been very interested in license plates and would draw them for hours. Her strongest skill was memory, and she could draw precise representations of license plates from different states. Ashley had always been very attached to her parents and sisters, and although affectionate toward babies, she showed minimal interest in other teenagers.\n\nAshley\u2019s family history was pertinent for a father with dyslexia, a paternal uncle with epilepsy, and a maternal male cousin with possible \u201cAsperger\u2019s syndrome.\u201d Her siblings, both sisters, were in college and doing well.\n\nOn examination, Ashley was an overweight young woman who made inconsistent eye contact but often peered out the corner of her eye. She had a beautiful smile and would sometimes laugh to herself, but most of the time her facial expressions were subdued. She did not initiate joint attention by trying to catch another person\u2019s eyes. She frequently ignored what others would say to her. To request a preferred object (e.g., a shiny magazine), Ashley would rock from foot to foot and point. When offered an object (e.g., a small decorated box), she brought it to her nose and lips for inspection. Ashley spoke in a high-pitched voice with unusual intonation. During the interview, she used multiple words and a few short phrases that were somewhat rote but communicative, such as \u201cI want to clean up,\u201d and \u201cDo you have a van?\u201d\n\nIn the months prior to the evaluation, Ashley\u2019s parents noticed that she had become increasingly apathetic. A medical evaluation concluded that urinary tract infections were the most likely cause for her symptoms, but antibiotics seemed only to make her more listless. Further medical evaluation led to more extensive genetic testing, and Ashley was diagnosed with Kleefstra syndrome, a rare genetic defect associated with multiple medical problems, including intellectual developmental disorder. The parents said they were also tested and found to \u201cbe negative.\u201d\n\nThe parents specifically wanted to know whether the genetic testing results affected Ashley\u2019s long-standing diagnoses and access to future services. Furthermore, they wanted to know whether their other two daughters should get tested for their risk of carrying genes for autism, intellectual disability, and\/or Kleefstra syndrome.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Identifying psychological disorders**\n\nI\u2019m considering the unspecified disorder of psychological development and thinking about the top five related diagnoses. These include Autism Spectrum Disorder (F84.0), Intellectual Developmental Disorder, severe (F72), Stereotypic Movement Disorder with self-injurious behavior (F98.4), Unspecified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder (F91.9), and Unspecified Depressive Disorder (F32.9) or possibly \"Other specified depressive disorder\" (F32.8). I have to base this on provided information and clinical expertise without inventing symptoms.\n\n**Structuring diagnoses list**\n\nI see that I need to provide a structured list of the top five most likely diagnoses, complete with codes. While they didn\u2019t specify provisional diagnoses, it might be valuable to include them. I should focus on comorbidities and consider plausible options based on the vignette regarding autism and intellectual disability, particularly with Kleefstra syndrome in mind. So, I think Autism Spectrum Disorder and Intellectual Developmental Disorder should be primary. Maybe we can consider other relevant diagnoses, such as behavioral and emotional disorders that typically start in childhood and adolescence.\n\n**Considering neurodevelopmental disorders**\n\nI can think about including \"Other Specified Neurodevelopmental Disorder (Kleefstra syndrome-associated neurodevelopmental disorder)\"\u2014that's indeed a DSM diagnosis. If we're already listing Autism Spectrum Disorder and Intellectual Disability, I'm wondering if adding this is really necessary. It could help capture some features not previously noted. \n\nI also consider whether \"Unspecified Neurodevelopmental Disorder\" would fit, but it seems off too. After reevaluating, this specific case indicates strong autism traits, severe intellectual disability, irritability, and recent changes that could relate to medical concerns.\n\n**Identifying top diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m considering the top five potential diagnoses: Autism Spectrum Disorder, Intellectual Disability, Stereotypic Movement Disorder with self-injury, possibly Unspecified Depressive Disorder or a mood disorder due to a medical condition, and maybe Unspecified Anxiety Disorder. \n\nIt's important to ensure I\u2019m using the correct DSM-5-TR codes. I know that Autism Spectrum Disorder is F84.0 and Intellectual Disability could be moderate (F71) or severe (F72). For Stereotypic Movement Disorder, the code is F98.4. I\u2019m also thinking about if the aggressive behaviors fit within the framework of \"Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder.\"\n\n**Finalizing the diagnoses list**\n\nI\u2019m considering the most likely diagnoses: Autism Spectrum Disorder, Intellectual Disability, Stereotypic Movement Disorder, and perhaps Unspecified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder due to significant aggressive behaviors. For the final slot, I might lean towards Unspecified Depressive Disorder reflecting recent apathy and listlessness.\n\nEven though some options, like Language Disorder or Unspecified Neurodevelopmental Disorder, could fit, I think Unspecified Depressive Disorder makes the most sense given the symptoms described. I need to ensure all diagnoses are applicable and align with DSM-5-TR standards.\n\n**Determining potential diagnoses**\n\nI'm considering Stereotypic Movement Disorder, which involves repetitive behaviors like rocking or hand-waving. However, self-biting as a reaction to distress might point toward self-injurious behavior rather than a stereotypy. There\u2019s also the option of including Intermittent Explosive Disorder, but it may not fit the criteria. \n\nI believe the best approach is to have a list that reflects the most likely diagnoses, including Autism Spectrum Disorder (F84.0), Intellectual Disability (F72), Stereotypic Movement Disorder (F98.4), and Unspecified Depressive Disorder (F32.A) as potential options to explore.\n\n**Formulating likely diagnoses**\n\nI need to provide a structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses without including genetic syndromes. It seems the top five diagnoses could include Autism Spectrum Disorder (F84.0) as primary; Intellectual Disability, severe (F72) as secondary; Stereotypic Movement Disorder (F98.4); Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder (F91.8); and Unspecified Depressive Disorder (F32.A). \n\nI must consider whether any of these diagnoses may fit well, particularly in light of observed behaviors and symptoms associated with the individual.\n\n**Compiling DSM-5-TR diagnoses**\n\nI need to follow the guidelines and provide a structured list of psychiatric diagnoses along with their corresponding F-codes without including clinical reasoning. The most likely top five diagnoses seem to be:\n\n1. Autism Spectrum Disorder - F84.0\n2. Intellectual Developmental Disorder, severe - F72\n3. Stereotypic Movement Disorder, with self-injurious behavior - F98.4\n4. Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder - F91.8\n5. Unspecified Depressive Disorder - F32.9 \n\nI'll ensure to keep the focus only on the diagnoses as outlined.\n\n**Finalizing DSM-5-TR diagnoses**\n\nI've been considering the best way to structure the psychiatric diagnoses, aiming to ensure they align with the guidelines. My top five F-codes are:\n\n1. Autism Spectrum Disorder - F84.0\n2. Intellectual Developmental Disorder, severe - F72\n3. Stereotypic Movement Disorder, with self-injurious behavior - F98.4\n4. Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder - F91.8\n5. Other Specified Neurodevelopmental Disorder (associated with Kleefstra syndrome) - F88 \n\nThis should fulfill the requirements based on the available information without unnecessary speculation.\n\n**Determining diagnoses and F-codes**\n\nI'm sorting through the appropriate F-codes for psychiatric diagnoses, considering that \"Other Specified Neurodevelopmental Disorder\" might not be necessary since the patient meets criteria for ASD and ID. The top five diagnoses I\u2019ve settled on are:\n\n1. Autism Spectrum Disorder - F84.0\n2. Intellectual Developmental Disorder, severe - F72\n3. Stereotypic Movement Disorder - F98.4\n4. Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder - F91.8\n5. Unspecified Depressive Disorder - F32.9\n\nThis list aligns with the instructions for a structured format without additional reasoning.\n\n**Choosing diagnoses and F-codes**\n\nI've been reviewing various diagnoses for the patient, focusing on her self-injurious behaviors and other symptoms. The top five likely diagnoses I've decided on are:\n\n1. Autism Spectrum Disorder - F84.0\n2. Intellectual Developmental Disorder, Severe - F72\n3. Stereotypic Movement Disorder, with Self-Injurious Behavior - F98.4\n4. Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder - F91.8\n5. Unspecified Depressive Disorder - F32.A\n\nI\u2019ll ensure these correspond to the appropriate DSM-5-TR codes while providing a clear list.\n\n**Finalizing diagnostic considerations**\n\nI'm refining the diagnoses based on expert-level reasoning. I initially considered \"Social (pragmatic) communication disorder,\" but it's ruled out due to restricted behaviors. \n\n\"Obsessive-compulsive disorder\" seemed a possibility because of her interest in license plates, but it's more of a circumscribed interest rather than true obsessions or compulsions. \n\nI'm also avoiding non-psychiatric conditions like obesity or UTI, as the focus is strictly on psychiatric diagnoses using F-codes. Now, I\u2019m ready to produce the final answer!",

    "vignette":"George Anderson, a 73-year-old married man, was referred to a psychiatrist for an evaluation of depression after screening positive on the Geriatric Depression Scale during a neurology appointment. For most of the 2 years since his diagnosis with Parkinson\u2019s disease, Mr. Anderson had coped well and continued to engage in many of his usual activities. His wife of 49 years noted that 1\u20132 years before developing Parkinson\u2019s disease, Mr. Anderson had become somewhat less enthusiastic and motivated compared with his baseline personality, but not to the point of causing any concern or impairment. The only other neuropsychiatric symptom preceding his Parkinson\u2019s diagnosis was his wife\u2019s report that during the past 5 years he frequently \u201cthrashed about\u201d while asleep.\n\nThree months prior to the referral, however, Mr. Anderson began to decline social invitations from family and friends. He reported that he had withdrawn socially because he had lost pleasure in things that used to excite him, although he denied persistent feelings of sadness or worry. He recognized that he was not his \u201cusual self\u201d and tried, to no avail, to give himself \u201cpep talks.\u201d He had worked as a high school science teacher until retirement at age 67, and reported having learned \u201cthe power of seeing the glass half full\u201d from his students. He felt frustrated that he could not \u201csnap out of it\u201d for the first time in his life but was hopeful about getting professional help. He denied wishing for death, explaining that although he was not afraid of death, he wanted to enjoy life as long as possible. He added, \u201cGod does not give me more than I can handle. I can\u2019t ask for a better family, and I have had a full life.\u201d\n\nOther new symptoms over the prior few months included increasing fatigue, impaired concentration and memory, unintentional weight loss, and sleep-onset insomnia. Further history on his more chronic sleep symptoms revealed that, around 3:00 a.m. or 4:00 a.m. on most nights, Mr. Anderson began violently moving his extremities and moaning as though in distress, all while still seemingly asleep in bed. He often awakened his wife with these movements and occasionally struck her in his sleep. She sometimes used a different bedroom because of this. When he awoke from such an incident, he was coherent and briefly anxious, often reporting that he had been dreaming of swimming or running from something.\n\nHis wife took over driving shortly after his Parkinson\u2019s disease diagnosis, but Mr. Anderson was otherwise independent in activities of daily living such as paying bills and managing his medications. His wife described him as \u201cmaybe a little more forgetful\u201d over the past few years, but neither of them was concerned about this mild memory loss.\n\nPast medical history included prostate cancer (in remission), glaucoma, and gout. Labs from his recent neurology visit were unremarkable, including blood counts, serum chemistries, thyroid function, and vitamin B12 levels. Family psychiatric history was positive only for a granddaughter with ADHD. He denied past problematic substance use and all current substance use except two or three glasses of wine monthly. He denied any previous depressive episodes, psychiatric treatment, or psychiatric evaluations.\n\nOn mental status examination, Mr. Anderson was pleasant, cooperative, and interpersonally engaging. Resting tremor, shuffling gait, hypophonia, and bradykinesia all were evident at mild to moderate levels. He occasionally smiled, but his affect was difficult to fully gauge because of masked facies. He reported his mood as \u201cblah.\u201d There was no evidence of psychosis.\n\nOn cognitive testing, he had some difficulty on the Trail Making Test part B, figure copying, and word-list recall, the latter being helped by category prompts. On a standardized brief cognitive assessment, he scored 25 out of 30 points, which was in the normal range.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Clarifying F-codes for diagnoses**\n\nI'm trying to stick to the instruction about F-codes for DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses. It seems they expect only F-codes, so I can't include REM sleep behavior disorder since it doesn't have an F code. Should I consider sleep-related movement disorder with G47.69 instead? That feels off. But maybe I could look at coding it under F51.8 for other sleep disorders? Yet, the DSM-5-TR clearly states \"REM sleep behavior disorder,\" and I\u2019m a bit stuck on this.\n\n**Sorting insomnia coding**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to include \"Insomnia disorder,\" which is F51.01 in ICD-10. F51.01 refers to \"Insomnia not due to a substance or known physiological condition.\" In the DSM-5, insomnia is linked to different codes, like 780.52 or 307.42, while ICD-10-CM goes with G47.00 for unspecified insomnia. So, it seems that DSM uses G codes, not F codes, for various sleep disorders like hypersomnolence, narcolepsy, and RBD. But there are indeed F51 codes for nonorganic sleep disorders.\n\n**Navigating sleep-wake disorder coding**\n\nI see that DSM uses G codes for sleep-wake disorders, but the user insists on F codes. It seems they might think all psychiatric diagnoses have F codes. The DSM does include sleep-wake disorders, but the ICD-10-CM crosswalk shows G codes. Since the instruction specifies F codes, I may need to focus on psychiatric diagnoses with those codes. We might need to exclude RBD and insomnia disorder because they fall under G. I\u2019m considering alternatives, like \"Other specified depressive disorder\" and wondering about \"Adjustment disorder with depressed mood.\"\n\n**Exploring depressive disorders and diagnoses**\n\nI'm considering the user's symptoms over the past three months. It could be \"Depressive disorder due to another medical condition\" because of Parkinson's disease. Another option is \"Persistent depressive disorder,\" but he only had decreased enthusiasm a couple of years prior, and that doesn't meet the impairment criteria. For cognitive issues, \"Mild neurocognitive disorder\" could fit, but it doesn't have an F code. The user wants DSM-5-TR diagnoses, so options like \"Mild neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson's\" use G31.84, and I'm feeling a bit stuck here.\n\n**Identifying psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m working on finding the right DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses with F codes for this case. \"Depressive disorder due to another medical condition\" related to Parkinson's could be F06.31 or F06.32 if major depressive-like features are present. There\u2019s a fine line to determine if it\u2019s major depressive disorder or due to the medical condition, especially with a history of symptoms and the context of PD. I also have to consider alternatives like \"Other specified depressive disorder\" and sleep disorders, though those codes might lean towards G codes in DSM-5-TR.\n\n**Clarifying F Code requirements**\n\nThe user insists on using F codes, but there's a confusion because many conditions in DSM-5-TR map to G codes. We need to stick to F codes, yet I\u2019m thinking about possible diagnoses. For instance, \"Unspecified neurocognitive disorder\" could fit with F09, capturing mild cognitive deficits. While \"Other specified parasomnia\" may be considered for REM sleep behavior disorder, it's tricky since it may not accurately reflect the condition but could fit the user's requirement for F codes. I hope to align with the user's directions effectively!\n\n**Evaluating potential diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to label the user\u2019s condition with appropriate F codes. \"Mild neurocognitive disorder\" isn't applicable, but \"Unspecified neurocognitive disorder\" as F09 might work since there are cognitive deficits. While \"Mild neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson's\" is plausible, it\u2019s coded G31.84. Looking at various symptoms, I think the most likely list includes: 1) Depressive disorder due to another medical condition - F06.32, 2) Other specified parasomnia - F51.8, 3) Unspecified neurocognitive disorder - F09, 4) Insomnia disorder - F51.01, and 5) Adjustment disorder with depressed mood - F43.21.\n\n**Analyzing diagnoses for Parkinson's-related conditions**\n\nI\u2019m examining potential diagnoses connected to the user\u2019s condition with an emphasis on F codes. \"Parkinson's disease with depressive features\" seems possible, but I also want to consider \"REM sleep behavior disorder\" as distinct. Weight loss might be linked to both depression and Parkinson's. The cognitive scoring suggests mild impairment, but they want five diagnoses with F codes. I can include: 1) Depressive disorder due to another medical condition - F06.32, 2) Major depressive disorder - F32.1, 3) Other specified depressive disorder - F32.8, 4) Unspecified neurocognitive disorder - F09, and 5) Other specified parasomnia - F51.8.\n\n**Structuring likely diagnoses**\n\nFor the user\u2019s request to provide a structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses, I can only consider those with F codes. It's clear I need to focus on psychiatric conditions rather than non-psychiatric ones. A plausible list includes: 1) Depressive disorder due to Parkinson's disease - F06.32, 2) Major depressive disorder, single episode - F32.1, 3) Adjustment disorder with depressed mood - F43.21, 4) Unspecified neurocognitive disorder - F09, and 5) Other specified parasomnia (possibly REM sleep behavior disorder) - F51.8. It seems crucial to choose only supportive conditions for the case presented.\n\n**Clarifying F-code diagnoses**\n\nI'm trying to figure out the appropriate DSM-5-TR diagnoses for sleep disorders and neurocognitive conditions, focusing on those with F codes. The requirement for F codes makes things tricky since REM sleep behavior disorder is G47.52. However, I can consider \"Other specified parasomnia\" and code it as F51.8. Additionally, I think I can include \"Mild neurocognitive disorder\" coded as F09 or \"Depressive disorder due to Parkinson's disease\" as F06.32. It's important that I stick to this guideline for the structured list.\n\n**Considering NCD and F-codes**\n\nI'm analyzing the best way to categorize mild neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson's disease while strictly following the requirement for F codes in the DSM-5-TR framework. It seems I should list \"Mild neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson\u2019s disease\" using F06.7. Still, I must ensure that I follow the guidelines that specify only diagnoses with F codes. \n\nIt looks like I should focus on including diagnoses like \"Major depressive disorder\" and \"Depressive disorder due to another medical condition\" while distinguishing other relevant conditions with their appropriate F codes.\n\n**Choosing Codes for Diagnosis**\n\nI'm deciding on the correct ICD-10-CM codes for the potential diagnoses related to depression and neurocognitive disorders, focusing on F codes. For instance, F06.32 seems suitable for mood disorders associated with physiological conditions, while F32.1 represents major depressive disorder. I'm also considering F51 codes for sleep disorders.\n\nGiven that the patient's presentation seems to emphasize depressive symptoms alongside clear signs of REM sleep behavior disorder, I\u2019m debating between labeling the primary diagnosis as either a depressive disorder due to Parkinson\u2019s disease or major depressive disorder. I'll need to reflect on which best fits the clinical context.\n\n**Finalizing Psychiatric Diagnoses**\n\nI'm working on a structured list of psychiatric diagnoses, focusing on appropriate F-codes. For the primary diagnosis, I\u2019m considering F06.32 for depressive disorder due to another medical condition, alongside F51.8 for REM sleep behavior disorder. I need to ensure that each diagnosis is properly coded, keeping in mind that mild neurocognitive disorder could be F09, but that doesn't fit perfectly. \n\nFor the top five, I\u2019m listing:  \n1. Depressive disorder due to another medical condition - F06.32  \n2. Major depressive disorder - F32.1  \n3. Other specified parasomnia (RBD) - F51.8  \n4. Unspecified neurocognitive disorder - F09  \n5. Assessing insomnia disorder vs. adjustment disorder for inclusion.\n\n**Deciding on Diagnoses**\n\nI'm trying to finalize the top psychiatric diagnoses for the case in question. I'm considering including \"Depressive disorder due to another medical condition,\" \"Major depressive disorder,\" and \"Unspecified depressive disorder.\" \n\nI want to rank the likelihood of each diagnosis, with REM sleep behavior disorder being very probable. However, as the referral is for depression, I need to balance that. \n\nUltimately, I plan to list:   \n1. Depressive disorder due to another medical condition (Parkinson\u2019s disease) - F06.32  \n2. Other specified parasomnia (REM sleep behavior disorder) - F51.8  \n3. Major depressive disorder - F32.1  \n4. Unspecified neurocognitive disorder - F09  \n5. Insomnia disorder - F51.01\n\n**Navigating Diagnosis Coding**\n\nI'm weighing if I can leave out the REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) diagnosis since it's not coded as F. However, the user request is for the top five diagnoses, and I want to ensure accuracy.\n\nWhile I'd ideally include RBD, it's tricky since the code is G47.52. I might categorize it under \"Other specified parasomnia\" with F51.8, but that feels less precise. If I select the second option, I can satisfy the F-code instruction while aligning with DSM-5-TR guidelines so long as I clarify it's a probable diagnosis. Let's fine-tune these points to ensure both accuracy and user expectations!\n\n**Evaluating Diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m considering different diagnoses, starting with \u201cMild neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson's disease,\u201d but its code is G31.84, not F. So, I might go with \u201cUnspecified neurocognitive disorder\u201d (F09) instead to satisfy user instruction on codes. \n\nI need to finalize five diagnostic labels. My top choices include \u201cDepressive disorder due to another medical condition (Parkinson\u2019s) - F06.32,\u201d \u201cOther specified parasomnia (possible RBD) - F51.8,\u201d \u201cUnspecified neurocognitive disorder - F09,\u201d and possibly \u201cMajor depressive disorder, single episode - F32.1.\u201d \n\nI'll focus on codes and clinical accuracy while ensuring I meet the user's requirements.\n\n**Selecting Diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m deciding on five diagnoses to provide. The primary candidate is \"Depressive disorder due to another medical condition\" (F06.32). I\u2019m also considering \"Major depressive disorder, single episode\" (F32.1) and \"Other specified parasomnia\" (F51.8). For a fourth, I\u2019m looking at \"Unspecified neurocognitive disorder\" (F09), and possibly \"Adjustment disorder with depressed mood\" (F43.21). \n\nI want to ensure these diagnoses are plausible based on the user's symptoms and not just filler. I\u2019m wrestling with whether \u201cAdjustment disorder\u201d is likely enough and may lean towards \u201cOther specified depressive disorder\u201d instead. This balancing act is tricky, but I want it accurate for the user!\n\n**Choosing Diagnoses**\n\nI'm working on selecting the top five diagnoses. I've considered \"Depressive disorder due to another medical condition\" (F06.32) as primary. I'm also looking at \"Major depressive disorder, single episode\" (F32.1) and \"Other specified parasomnia\" (F51.8) for my secondary choices. I'm weighing \"Unspecified neurocognitive disorder\" (F09) and \"Insomnia disorder\" (F51.05). \n\nI need to ensure the final choices reflect the most likely scenarios based on the information available. Let\u2019s finalize that list!\n\n**Evaluating Depression Symptoms**\n\nIn older adults, depression can manifest as anhedonia and somatic symptoms without sadness, which applies here. Symptoms like fatigue, weight loss, and insomnia may be linked to Parkinson's disease (PD) rather than depression itself. He experiences social withdrawal, suggesting potential depression or apathy, but he doesn't report traditional depressive symptoms like sadness or hopelessness. \n\nChoosing a diagnosis, \"Depressive disorder due to another medical condition, with depressive features\" (F06.31) seems prudent. I'll need to weigh the primary diagnosis carefully to ensure I capture the real clinical picture.\n\n**Rethinking Diagnostic Codes**\n\nI\u2019m considering coding mild neurocognitive disorder and whether to go with F06.7. It's tricky since DSM doesn\u2019t directly label it this way. I should align with DSM-5-TR, which uses \"Mild neurocognitive disorder.\" For this case, I might opt for \u201cUnspecified neurocognitive disorder\u201d (F09) since it avoids specifying an etiology. \n\nI\u2019m also factoring in insomnia and refining the list of possible diagnoses, balancing main conditions. My top picks are \"Depressive disorder due to Parkinson's disease\" and related depressive disorders, which seem suitable given the symptoms.\n\n**Finalizing Diagnosis Codes**\n\nI\u2019m deciding on the best diagnosis codes, especially for \"Mild neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson\u2019s disease,\" although that doesn\u2019t really align perfectly with F codes. I\u2019m checking insomnia options and thinking using F51.05 might make sense since the depression impacts it. However, including insomnia separately seems tricky, and I could opt for an adjustment disorder instead. \n\nFor the final list, I want to ensure every diagnosis aligns with the required F code while accurately reflecting the patient\u2019s condition. My final selection includes primary and secondary diagnoses that highlight both cognitive and depressive symptoms effectively.\n\n**Selecting Diagnosis Codes**\n\nI'm deliberating on the best F codes for various psychiatric diagnoses while considering the user's request for DSM-5-TR alignments. It seems that I can use F51.01 for insomnia, but I'm realizing that may not fully fit due to the context of depression and RBD. I'm weighing including \"Mild neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson\u2019s disease,\" but the fit with codes such as F06.7 is wobbly.\n\nUltimately, I want to produce a final list that captures both clinical accuracy and the coding requirements, aiming for a diverse yet relevant selection of diagnoses while maintaining a clear focus on the F-coded options.\n\n**Choosing Diagnostic Codes**\n\nI'm reviewing potential diagnostic codes for a case, focusing particularly on neurocognitive disorders, sleep issues, and depression. I think \"Unspecified neurocognitive disorder\" (F09) fits here, and for parasomnia, \u201cOther specified parasomnia\u201d (F51.8) is a suitable choice. I'm contemplating how to incorporate depressive disorders accurately without redundancy, considering various nuances of the symptoms and possible diagnoses.\n\nThe idea is to finalize a clear top five list that reflects the patient's situation without overlap. Ultimately, it\u2019s essential to clarify which features are prominent, particularly given the complex interaction of conditions.\n\n**Finalizing Diagnoses List**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether the symptoms truly meet the full criteria, and I might be stuck on choosing between codes for depressive disorders. It seems reasonable to include \"Other specified depressive disorder\" but let\u2019s keep in mind that I can't suggest non-psychiatric diagnoses without F codes.\n\nI want to finalize the top five diagnoses correctly. Ranking them based on likelihood, I'll make sure to present them clearly without overthinking. Ultimately, I need to ensure that all selected codes accurately reflect the understanding of the symptoms at play.\n\n**Deciding on Diagnoses**\n\nIt's time to finalize the five diagnoses based on what's most appropriate. The primary would be \"Depressive disorder due to Parkinson\u2019s disease, with major depressive-like episode - F06.32.\" The secondary diagnoses can include \"Other specified parasomnia (probable REM sleep behavior disorder) - F51.8,\" \"Major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate - F32.1,\" \"Unspecified neurocognitive disorder - F09,\" and \"Other specified depressive disorder - F32.8.\" I\u2019ll format this as a simple numbered list without additional text for clarity. Let's keep this straightforward!",
    "model_diagnosis":"1. Depressive disorder due to another medical condition (Parkinson\u2019s disease), with major depressive-like episode - F06.32  \n2. Other specified parasomnia (probable REM sleep behavior disorder) - F51.8  \n3. Major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate - F32.1  \n4. Unspecified neurocognitive disorder - F09  \n5. Other specified depressive disorder - F32.8"

    "vignette":"A psychiatric transplant liaison service was called to evaluate Robert Jennings, a 50-year-old married white man, for a liver transplant in the context of an alcohol use disorder, advanced cirrhosis, and no other prior psychiatric history. Several weeks earlier, he had been hospitalized with acute alcohol-associated hepatitis and diagnosed with end-stage liver disease. Prednisolone 40 mg\/day was prescribed for treatment of the hepatitis. Prior to that hospitalization, he had been unaware that his alcohol consumption was seriously damaging his health and was shocked to learn that he would eventually require a liver transplant. Upon discharge, he began an addiction treatment program that was mandatory for him to be listed for possible transplantation.\n\nOutpatient psychiatric consultation was requested by the transplant team after the patient\u2019s family expressed concern that he had recently become increasingly irritable and anxious and seemed to be having difficulty coping with the requirements for transplantation. Mr. Jennings\u2019s primary care physician had recently prescribed alprazolam 0.5 mg as needed for his anxiety. This was initially helpful, but after several days his family noticed he seemed more irritable, lethargic, and forgetful.\n\nWhen interviewed, the patient said that he had been tired for months prior to the diagnosis and that the fatigue had hampered his ability to work (his job required making deliveries for a shipping firm). Although the diagnosis had been a shock, he said he had left the hospital feeling \u201cgreat, better than I\u2019d felt in years.\u201d For about a week after discharge, he described having enhanced energy and a sense of well-being, but he then began to feel anxious and restless. He slept poorly, unable to concentrate, and worried constantly about his health, finances, and family. He became less engaged with his family and stopped watching movies, normally his favorite pastime.\n\nHe denied having nightmares, flashbacks, avoidant behaviors, or racing thoughts. He also denied low mood, tearfulness, appetite changes, anhedonia, helplessness, hopelessness, or suicidality. He reported that he had started drinking daily 10 years earlier, stating that he enjoyed the taste of beer and liked socializing with friends after work. He developed tolerance to alcohol, needing to consume six to eight drinks per night to achieve the same effect. He described some withdrawal symptoms in the morning but did not drink during work hours; he underwent random testing due to his job as a truck driver. He did miss some family activities, preferring to drink, and this had been a source of marital conflict. He admitted feeling guilty about his alcohol use and its impact on him and his family. He denied using any alcohol since his hospitalization. He admitted to anger over having to undergo addiction counseling and had argued with the transplant team about this requirement. He denied having been an anxious person and considered himself able to handle most of life\u2019s challenges without being overwhelmed. His family confirmed his description of himself and viewed his recent behavior as uncharacteristic.\n\nOn mental status examination, Mr. Jennings was a thin, jaundiced, tired-appearing man. His gait was normal, but he was fidgety while seated. He maintained eye contact and responded appropriately, although he repeatedly made comments like, \u201cSomething isn\u2019t right\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s not all in my head.\u201d His affect was anxious and irritable, and his speech was terse. He appeared distracted but denied confusion and disorientation. He had no delusions or hallucinations. His thoughts were logical and coherent, without disorganization, and there was no latency to his responses. He scored 26 out of 30 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, missing points for recall and serial 7s. He scored in the normal range for Trail Making Test A and B but asked to have the instructions repeated for Trails B.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Evaluating cognitive symptoms**\n\nI\u2019m looking into cognitive symptoms related to hepatic encephalopathy and how they align with F-codes. Delirium, which could stem from another medical condition, is classified as F05. There may be mild cognitive impairment linked to hepatic encephalopathy, suggesting \"Mild neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition.\" However, the patient doesn't exhibit severe cognitive decline negatively impacting independence. While he does show some signs of mild impairment, it\u2019s unclear if it stems from alcohol-induced neurocognitive disorder.\n\n**Assessing anxiety and mood disorders**\n\nI\u2019m exploring the possibility of \"Substance\/medication-induced anxiety disorder\" from corticosteroids or possible alcohol withdrawal since he stopped drinking after hospitalization. However, it\u2019s several weeks later, which makes withdrawal unlikely. He denies previous anxiety, but there could be protracted anxiety symptoms. \n\nAdditionally, \"Substance\/Medication-Induced Bipolar and Related Disorder\" could relate to corticosteroids causing hypomanic symptoms. He did experience an elevated mood and increased energy, but he later reported poor sleep. So, it might be best to consider \"Substance\/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder\" due to prednisolone.\n\n**Analyzing anxiety and substance use**\n\nI\u2019m considering the DSM criteria for diagnosing prominent anxiety or panic developing from substance use. The symptoms he exhibited began after starting prednisolone during hospitalization, with feelings of euphoria followed by anxiety and insomnia. This timing suggests it\u2019s likely related to the steroid treatment. \n\nHowever, the primary diagnosis seems to lean towards severe alcohol use disorder, given his history of tolerance, withdrawal, and drinking habits. He\u2019s been abstinent since hospitalization, but factors like daily consumption, cravings, and relationship issues suggest a moderate to severe diagnosis as he undergoes transplant evaluation.\n\n**Evaluating alcohol use disorder diagnosis**\n\nI\u2019m working on the consult focused on irritability, anxiety, and coping, but there's an underlying alcohol use disorder (AUD) present. It seems the primary diagnosis could be \"Alcohol use disorder, severe, in early remission.\" Based on the ICD-10-CM codes, F10.20 pertains to alcohol dependence unspecified, and F10.21 is for alcohol dependence in remission. For DSM-5, moderate\/severe AUD corresponds with F10.20, and while early remission uses F10.21, it seems the specifier for early vs. sustained doesn\u2019t change the code. I\u2019m checking that F10.21 might apply here.\n\n**Diagnosing alcohol use and anxiety**\n\nI\u2019m trying to clarify the diagnosis, and it looks like the patient has alcohol use disorder (AUD). Given his abstinence since hospitalization, I initially thought about coding it as \"Alcohol use disorder, severe, in early remission.\" However, he's only been sober for a few weeks, which means he doesn't meet the criteria for early remission, as that requires at least three months. \n\nConsidering his symptoms and history, I might settle on coding for moderate AUD, likely F10.20. His current anxiety could also fit \"Adjustment disorder with anxiety,\" possibly linked to his transplant concerns and steroid use. It appears he\u2019s experiencing a range of symptoms that demand careful evaluation.\n\n**Evaluating possible diagnoses**\n\nI'm thinking about the primary and secondary diagnoses for this case. \"Adjustment disorder with anxiety\" (F43.22) seems like a strong candidate for the primary diagnosis, alongside \"Alcohol use disorder, moderate\" (F10.20). \n\nI also wonder if he might be experiencing \"Substance\/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder\" due to corticosteroids, but we have to ensure these fit the criteria. His symptoms like anxiety and irritability align with adjustment disorder since they stem from identifiable stressors, like his diagnosis. I should finalize a list of the top five diagnoses reflecting these concerns.\n\n**Listing potential diagnoses**\n\nI'm aiming to compile a list of the top five diagnoses with their corresponding F-codes. First, I\u2019ll start with \"Alcohol Use Disorder (moderate)\" - F10.20, and \"Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety\" - F43.22. For the third, I\u2019m considering \"Substance\/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder\", with the F06.4 code likely applicable since it covers medication-induced effects. \n\nI've got to finalize this diagnosis list, ensuring it accurately reflects the patient's conditions and symptoms. Let's wrap it up!\n\n**Compiling diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m assembling a list of five likely psychiatric diagnoses with their F-codes. Firstly, I'll consider \"Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety\" - F43.22, and \"Alcohol Use Disorder, Moderate\" - F10.20. A potential third could be \"Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition\" - F06.4, possibly relating to hepatic encephalopathy. For the fourth, I\u2019m thinking \"Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition\" - F06.7. Lastly, maybe \"Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Intoxication\" - F13.929, given the patient's symptoms. Let's finalize this proper list!\n\n**Determining possible diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m assessing potential psychiatric diagnoses for a patient struggling with multiple issues. The first might be \"Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety\" - F43.22, given the stress of his condition. Secondly, I\u2019ll consider \"Alcohol Use Disorder, Moderate\" - F10.20. The third could be \"Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition\" - F06.4 connecting it to hepatic encephalopathy. I've also noted \"Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition\" - F06.7 and \"Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Intoxication\" - F13.929 due to alprazolam use. Time to finalize this list!\n\n**Analyzing psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nThe patient started on steroids, experiencing a brief period of euphoria before developing anxiety and restlessness, which points toward steroid-induced mood disorders. I\u2019m considering \"Substance\/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder\" or \"Substance\/Medication-Induced Bipolar Disorder.\" The initial uplift may align with hypomania, but there\u2019s insufficient evidence.\n\nI could also include \"Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety\" due to the stress of his current medical situation, but the anxiety may primarily stem from the medication. Evaluating the top diagnoses, I\u2019ll prioritize \"Adjust Disorder with Anxiety\" or \"Corticosteroid-Induced Anxiety Disorder.\"\n\n**Clarifying diagnoses and coding**\n\nPrednisolone is known to cause anxiety and mood changes, and since the patient denied prior anxiety, I\u2019m leaning toward diagnosing \"Substance\/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder (corticosteroid-induced)\" possibly coded as F06.4. I need to confirm if this aligns with DSM classifications, particularly considering medication-induced codes.\n\nIt's also essential to assess cognitive impairment and assess the role of alprazolam. I\u2019m listing potential final diagnoses, including \"Alcohol Use Disorder,\" \"Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety,\" and \"Mild Neurocognitive Disorder.\" Proper codes for each will be crucial for accurate documentation.\n\n**Reviewing sedative\/hypnotic codes**\n\nI'm checking the codes for sedative\/hypnotic intoxication. It looks like for sedative\/hypnotic use, F13.929 seems correct. The patient has shown signs of sedation and memory impairment without the more classic signs of intoxication, which is a bit tricky.\n\nI\u2019m weighing which diagnosis to prioritize. Alcohol use disorder is evident, but I also need to consider \"Substance\/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder\" due to corticosteroids. I\u2019m leaning towards using M06.4 as the code since it captures the medication-induced aspect closely.\n\n**Deciding on diagnoses and codes**\n\nI\u2019m working on the top five diagnoses and their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes. I\u2019m considering Substance\/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder (corticosteroid-induced) as a primary diagnosis, possibly coded as F06.4. For secondary diagnoses, I might list Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety (F43.22), Mild Neurocognitive Disorder (F06.7), Alcohol Use Disorder (F10.20), and Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Intoxication (F13.929). I need to weigh which one fits best based on the patient\u2019s symptoms and the context of their consult.\n\n**Finalizing differential diagnoses**\n\nI need to provide a structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses, focusing on the top five most likely. I\u2019m considering Substance\/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder, probably corticosteroid-induced with the code F06.4. Other possibilities include Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety (F43.22) and Mild Neurocognitive Disorder due to another condition (F06.7). I also need to include Alcohol Use Disorder (F10.20) and Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Intoxication (F13.929). I\u2019ll ensure the list is concise, sticking to only diagnoses and their corresponding codes.\n\n**Finalizing diagnoses list**\n\nI need to provide a structured list of diagnoses as requested. The primary diagnosis will be \"Substance\/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder - F06.4.\" The secondary diagnoses are \"Alcohol Use Disorder, moderate - F10.20,\" \"Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety - F43.22,\" \"Mild Neurocognitive Disorder due to Another Medical Condition - F06.7,\" and \"Sedative-, Hypnotic-, or Anxiolytic Intoxication - F13.929.\" I'll ensure that each diagnosis is aligned with DSM-5-TR and presented clearly without any additional explanations.",

    "vignette":"Peter Winters, a 46-year-old married white minister, was referred to the psychiatry outpatient department by his primary care doctor for depressive symptoms and opioid misuse in the setting of chronic right knee pain.\n\nMr. Winters injured his right knee playing basketball 17 months earlier. His mother gave him several tablets of hydrocodone-acetaminophen that she had for back pain, and he found this helpful. When he ran out of the pills and his pain persisted, he went to the emergency room. He was told he had a mild sprain. He was given a 1-month supply of hydrocodone-acetaminophen. He took the pills as prescribed for 1 month, and his pain resolved.\n\nAfter stopping the pills, however, Mr. Winters began to experience a recurrence of the pain in his knee. He saw an orthopedist, who ordered imaging studies and determined that there was no structural damage. Mr. Winters was given another 1-month supply of hydrocodone-acetaminophen. This time, however, he needed to take more than prescribed in order to ease the pain. He also felt dysphoric and \u201cachy\u201d when he abstained from taking the medication, and described a \u201ccraving\u201d for more opioids. He returned to the orthopedist, who referred him to a pain specialist.\n\nMr. Winters was too embarrassed to go to the pain specialist, believing that his faith and strength should help him overcome the pain. He found it impossible to live without the pain medication, however, because of the pain, dysphoria, and muscle aches when he stopped the medication. He also began to \u201cenjoy the high\u201d and experienced intense craving. He began to frequent emergency rooms to receive more opioids, often lying about the timing and nature of his right knee pain, and even stole pills from his mother on two occasions. He became preoccupied with trying to find more opioids, and his work and home life suffered. He endorsed low mood, especially when contemplating the impact of opioids on his life, but denied any other mood or neurovegetative symptoms. Eventually, he told his primary care doctor about his opioid use and low mood, and that doctor referred him to the outpatient psychiatry clinic.\n\nMr. Winters had a history of two lifetime major depressive episodes that were treated successfully with escitalopram by his primary care doctor. He also had a history of an alcohol use disorder when he was in his 20s. He managed to quit using alcohol on his own after a family intervention. He smoked two packs of cigarettes daily. His father suffered from depression, and \u201calmost everyone\u201d on his mother\u2019s side of the family had \u201cissues with addiction.\u201d He had been married to his wife for 20 years, and they had two school-age children. He had been a minister in his church for 15 years. Results of a recent physical examination and laboratory testing performed by his primary care physician had been within normal limits.\n\nOn mental status examination, Mr. Winters was cooperative and did not exhibit any psychomotor abnormalities. He answered most questions briefly, often simply saying \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d Speech was of a normal rate and tone, without tangentiality or circumstantiality. He reported that his mood was \u201clousy,\u201d and his affect was dysphoric and constricted. He denied symptoms of paranoia or hallucinations. He denied any thoughts of harming himself or others. Memory, both recent and remote, was grossly intact.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Evaluating coding for disorders**\n\nIn ICD-10-CM, there's a code F11.24 for \"Opioid dependence with opioid-induced mood disorder.\" Meanwhile, DSM-5-TR includes a substance\/medication-induced depressive disorder. I could list \"Opioid-induced depressive disorder\" using F11.24 alongside OUD codes, but that might lead to double counting since the F11.24 includes mood disorders. A better approach would be to code \"Opioid use disorder, severe\" as F11.20 and note \"Substance\/medication-induced depressive disorder (opioid-induced)\" as F11.24, though they are quite similar.\n\n**Reviewing opioid disorder codes**\n\nI can also consider using F32.89 for other specified depressive disorder, but it doesn't cover substance-induced issues. It seems a primary diagnosis could be \"Opioid use disorder, severe, with withdrawal\" coded as F11.23, which includes withdrawal. In DSM, I might specify \"Opioid use disorder, severe\" separately, along with \"Opioid withdrawal\" using F11.23, which corresponds to the DSM-5\u2019s 292.0. Both codes represent withdrawal, yet DSM tends to prefer F11.20 for moderate to severe OUD while using F11.10 for mild.\n\n**Clarifying opioid disorder codes**\n\nIn DSM-5, there are specific codes after all: mild opioid use disorder is 305.50 (F11.10), while moderate\/severe is 304.00 (F11.20). There's also F11.11 for early remission, and F11.23 for opioid withdrawal. Since the case meets many criteria, it leans toward moderate or severe, so F11.20 seems suitable. The patient has low mood and dysphoria but doesn\u2019t meet the major depressive episode criteria, as they lack enough symptoms. It might be categorized as \"Other specified depressive disorder\" instead.\n\n**Analyzing depressive disorder criteria**\n\nTo classify a depressive episode, I need at least two weeks of depressed mood and one other symptom. For \"Other specified depressive disorder,\" symptoms need to cause significant distress but don\u2019t meet full criteria. This could involve depressed mood and possibly one other symptom, like dysphoria or guilt. I might also consider \"Short-duration depressive episode,\" but the information isn\u2019t clear. Alternatively, \"Adjustment disorder with depressed mood\" could fit due to opioid misuse, though I lack details on timing related to the stressor. His low mood seems significant, especially when reflecting on the situation.\n\n**Formulating top diagnoses**\n\nWe need to narrow down to the top five diagnoses considering the referral for depressive symptoms. Including \"Other specified depressive disorder\" or \"Unspecified depressive disorder\" could be reasonable since symptoms may not meet full criteria. His mood issues might relate to substance use, so \"Adjustment disorder with depressed mood\" could fit, but timing is unclear. Additionally, \"Opioid-induced depressive disorder\" needs consideration for withdrawal symptoms. Due to a history of Major Depressive Disorder, we might list \"MDD recurrent in partial remission\" as he has low mood but not full criteria. Also, we should include his tobacco use disorder and consider additional diagnoses.\n\n**Selecting key diagnoses**\n\nWe need to create a structured list of diagnoses based on the vignette, considering both current and past conditions. Here's what I'm thinking:\n\n1. Opioid use disorder, severe - F11.20  \n2. Opioid withdrawal - F11.23  \n3. Tobacco use disorder - F17.200  \n4. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, in partial remission - F33.41  \n5. Alcohol use disorder, in sustained remission - F10.21  \n\nGiven his history of Major Depressive Disorder and current low mood, we might also consider \"Other specified depressive disorder\" if symptoms don't meet MDD criteria. Overall, it\u2019s a nuanced situation, so we should reflect on his unique context while making these choices.\n\n**Analyzing past psychiatric history**\n\nThe individual has a history of two major depressive episodes treated successfully with escitalopram, and alcohol use disorder from his 20s that he quit after family intervention. He has a heavy smoking habit and a family background of depression and addiction. His mental status shows low mood and dysphoric affect but denies severe symptoms. \n\nWhile opioid use disorder is evident, it\u2019s uncertain if his current mood issues meet the criteria for a major depressive episode or relate to opioid withdrawal, leaving room for \"Other specified depressive disorder\" or \"Adjustment disorder with depressed mood.\" It\u2019s complex!\n\n**Choosing diagnoses for the case**\n\nI need to compare \"Opioid use disorder, severe\" and \"Opioid dependence.\" The top diagnoses are clear now: primary is Opioid use disorder, severe; secondary is Opioid withdrawal along with Tobacco use disorder; next is Major depressive disorder, recurrent, or another specified depressive disorder. The history of alcohol use disorder will also be included.\n\nI'm examining the criteria for opioid withdrawal symptoms. Despite his reported symptoms, he may not fully meet the criteria due to needing three symptoms. There are complexities here, but I\u2019m determined to create a clear list of the most likely diagnoses based on his history and current state!\n\n**Determining diagnoses for the case**\n\nI'm considering the right codes for tobacco use disorder and alcohol use disorder in sustained remission. Given the history of major depressive disorder (MDD), it complicates things since he has low mood symptoms now but may not meet full criteria for an episode. I think we should likely include MDD as a secondary diagnosis since he has a history.\n\nSo, the possible top five diagnoses could be:  \n1. Opioid use disorder, severe.  \n2. Tobacco use disorder.  \n3. Major depressive disorder, recurrent in remission.  \n4. Alcohol use disorder in sustained remission.  \n5. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood or Other specified depressive disorder.\n\n**Analyzing potential diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to include both major depressive disorder (MDD) recurrent in remission and possibly another specified depressive disorder due to his current symptoms. It\u2019s tricky because current low mood might suggest a mild recurrence, but I can\u2019t assume he\u2019s experiencing full MDD since he denies more symptoms. He does have a history of MDD. \n\nSo, my top five diagnoses could be:  \n1. Opioid use disorder (OUD).  \n2. Tobacco use disorder.  \n3. Major depressive disorder, recurrent (status uncertain).  \n4. Alcohol use disorder in sustained remission.  \n5. Other specified depressive disorder or adjustment disorder with depressed mood.\n\n**Determining top diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out how to include major depressive disorder (MDD) in this case without confirming it outright. In psychiatric practice, I could consider MDD, substance-induced mood disorder, and adjustment disorder. We need a top five list, and while MDD recurrent can be one, it\u2019s essential to use proper F-codes. \n\nI think my final diagnoses should include:  \n1. Opioid use disorder (OUD), severe - F11.20  \n2. Major depressive disorder, recurrent - F33.9  \n3. Tobacco use disorder - F17.210  \n4. Alcohol use disorder in sustained remission - F10.21  \n5. Other specified depressive disorder or unspecified depressive disorder for current symptoms.\n\n**Deciding on diagnoses**\n\nI need to finalize the top five psychiatric diagnoses. I think including a history of major depressive disorder (MDD) might complicate things, especially since we\u2019d have two mood-related diagnoses. If I include MDD, I should specify \u201cMDD recurrent, in partial remission\u201d since subthreshold symptoms are present, which means full remission isn't accurate.\n\nI might have:  \n1. Opioid use disorder, severe - F11.20  \n2. Tobacco use disorder - F17.210  \n3. Alcohol use disorder, in sustained remission - F10.21  \n4. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, in partial remission - F33.41  \n5. Other specified depressive disorder - F32.89.\n\n**Determining diagnoses**\n\nAlright, I need to finalize the list of top five psychiatric diagnoses. I\u2019m considering the history of major depressive disorder (MDD), but it may not need inclusion alongside current depressive symptoms. If I go with \u201cMajor depressive disorder, recurrent, in partial remission,\u201d it captures some current symptoms.\n\nSo for the list, I think I\u2019ll go with:\n1. Opioid use disorder, severe - F11.20\n2. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, in partial remission - F33.41\n3. Tobacco use disorder - F17.210\n4. Alcohol use disorder, in sustained remission - F10.21\n5. Opioid withdrawal - F11.23.\n\nThis setup incorporates the complexities appropriately!\n\n**Clarifying diagnoses**\n\nI'm focusing on the list of psychiatric diagnoses. I\u2019m considering \"Major depressive disorder (MDD), recurrent\" with a specifier of \"in partial remission\" or \"unspecified\" since he shows limited symptoms. \n\nFor the list, I might go with:\n1. Opioid use disorder, severe - F11.20\n2. MDD recurrent, in partial remission - F33.41\n3. Tobacco use disorder - F17.210\n4. Alcohol use disorder, in sustained remission - F10.21\n5. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood - F43.21 or \"Other specified depressive disorder\" - F32.89.\n\nThere\u2019s some back and forth, but I think this captures his situation accurately!\n\n**Determining depressive diagnoses**\n\nI'm trying to navigate the nuances of diagnosing depression within the DSM framework. \"Partial remission\" can apply when someone has some symptoms after an episode but not enough for a full diagnosis. Since he currently has some depressive symptoms, I\u2019m considering the best way to classify those. \n\nI might list:\n1. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, unspecified - F33.9\n2. Other specified depressive disorder (not meeting full MDD criteria) - F32.89\n3. Opioid use disorder, severe - F11.20\n4. Alcohol use disorder, in sustained remission - F10.21\n5. Tobacco use disorder - F17.210.\n\nThis should capture his situation accurately!\n\n**Evaluating depressive diagnoses**\n\nI'm considering how to classify the patient's current condition. It seems like adjustment disorder with depressed mood could apply due to opioid misuse and chronic pain. However, the symptoms need to be linked to a stressor and meet criteria within three months. \n\nUltimately, I might lean toward \"Unspecified depressive disorder\" (F32.A) since it captures my observations without tying to specific episodes. Alternatively, I\u2019m weighing \"Other specified depressive disorder\" (F32.89). \n\nTo finalize, I plan to include:\n1. Opioid use disorder, severe\n2. Chronic pain syndrome\n3. Unspecified depressive disorder (F32.A) \n4. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, in full remission (F33.42)\n5. Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions (F54).\n\n**Assessing substance use and mood disorders**\n\nI\u2019m evaluating the patient\u2019s nicotine use, which is at two packs a day, meeting criteria for tobacco use disorder. Primarily, I\u2019m considering \"Opioid use disorder, severe\" (F11.20) for his opioid dependency. I might also include \"Major depressive disorder, recurrent, unspecified\" (F33.9), as mood symptoms exist. \n\nAdditionally, I\u2019ll add \"Alcohol use disorder, in sustained remission\" (F10.21) due to historical context, plus \"Opioid withdrawal\" (F11.23) since the patient shows symptoms like dysphoria and muscle aches. This gives a solid diagnosis without overcomplicating things.\n\n**Evaluating diagnoses for depressive symptoms**\n\nI\u2019m considering the patient's diagnoses. Using \"Major depressive disorder, recurrent, in partial remission\" (F33.41) alongside \"opioid withdrawal\" as a fifth diagnosis seems plausible. His depressive mood is present, but he lacks a full major episode. \n\nI might also include \"Adjustment disorder with depressed mood\" (F43.21), given that his current symptoms could be reactive to stress rather than meeting full MDE criteria. Still, I have to carefully consider all factors and ensure the top diagnoses are ranked properly to reflect their significance.\n\n**Determining appropriate diagnoses**\n\nI'm trying to figure out the best way to list the patient's diagnoses. It seems I might want to use \"Major depressive disorder, recurrent\" but potentially include \"Adjustment disorder with depressed mood\" for his current symptoms. However, if I opt for both, it might feel redundant. \n\nMy final list might look like this:\n\n1. Opioid use disorder, severe - F11.20\n2. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood - F43.21\n3. Major depressive disorder, recurrent - F33.9\n4. Tobacco use disorder - F17.210\n5. Alcohol use disorder, in sustained remission - F10.21\n\nThis captures both the current and historical aspects of his mood.\n\n**Finalizing diagnoses list**\n\nI need to finalize the top five most likely diagnoses for the patient. The primary diagnosis might be \"Opioid use disorder, severe\" (F11.20) due to his opioid misuse. Then I could include \"Major depressive disorder, recurrent\" (F33.9) even if current symptoms are mild. \n\nFor the secondary diagnoses, I'll consider:\n\n1. Opioid use disorder, severe - F11.20\n2. Major depressive disorder, recurrent - F33.9\n3. Tobacco use disorder - F17.210\n4. Alcohol use disorder, in sustained remission - F10.21\n5. Opioid withdrawal - F11.23\n\nThis setup covers his primary issues and secondary factors effectively.\n\n**Choosing final diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m considering the five most likely diagnoses for the patient. Including \"Opioid-induced depressive disorder\" alongside \"Major depressive disorder\" feels tricky, as they may both not be needed. Since the prompt asks for current diagnoses, I need to focus on comorbid conditions rather than alternatives.\n\nI think a solid list would be:\n\n1. Opioid use disorder, severe - F11.20\n2. Major depressive disorder, recurrent - F33.9\n3. Alcohol use disorder, in sustained remission - F10.21\n4. Tobacco use disorder - F17.210\n5. Opioid withdrawal - F11.23\n\nThis seems coherent and accurately captures the patient's condition.\n\n**Verifying diagnoses**\n\nI'm going through the diagnoses to ensure they all meet the necessary DSM criteria. For \"Opioid use disorder,\" there's a strong case for it being severe, and the history of \"Major depressive disorder, recurrent\" fits too. \"Tobacco use disorder\" may be likely, but isn\u2019t fully detailed. \"Alcohol use disorder\" is confirmed as in sustained remission. For \"Opioid withdrawal,\" some symptoms are present.\n\nAfter considering the codes, I think the final list could be:\n\n1. Opioid use disorder, severe - F11.20\n2. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, in partial remission - F33.41\n3. Tobacco use disorder - F17.210\n4. Alcohol use disorder, in sustained remission - F10.21\n5. Opioid withdrawal - F11.23\n\nThat seems coherent and accurate.\n\n**Finalizing diagnosis list**\n\nI'm structuring the final list of diagnoses with corresponding F-codes, as per the user's request. The consideration of his history of alcohol use disorder gives additional context, but the focus now is strictly on formatting. \n\nHere\u2019s the structured list of diagnoses:\n\n1. Opioid use disorder, severe - F11.20  \n2. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, in partial remission - F33.41  \n3. Tobacco use disorder (nicotine dependence, cigarettes) - F17.210  \n4. Alcohol use disorder, in sustained remission - F10.21  \n5. Opioid withdrawal - F11.23  \n\nLet\u2019s ensure everything aligns correctly!",

    "vignette":"The patient is an 18-year-old non-binary college freshman with a complex psychiatric presentation. They report a history of childhood anxiety, perfectionism, and ritualistic self-punishment behaviors starting in the third grade. Currently, their most debilitating symptom is anxiety about \"contaminated air\" when others cough or sneeze, prompting them to cover their face and hold their breath even when the trigger is far away or on television. They engage in checking and counting behaviors based on the number 3, including checking mirrors while driving, locking\/unlocking their car, and tapping their toothbrush. These compulsions are experienced as uncontrollable, with the patient reporting they sometimes modify behaviors (like holding an imaginary door handle in their pocket) when the original compulsion would be disruptive. At approximately age 16, the patient developed anorexia nervosa, restricting their food intake and ultimately requiring intervention from parents and a treatment team. Despite gaining weight under external pressure, the patient continues to restrict eating, has a distinct fear of gaining weight, becoming fat, fasting until dinner, drinking coffee to intentionally upset their stomach. Their BMI currently falls within the normal range. Around the same time their eating disorder developed, the patient experienced depressive symptoms including hopelessness, low motivation, and self-harm behaviors (pulling hair, cutting, punching stomach). They had suicidal ideation during high school, including thoughts of jumping in front of a train and fantasizing about wandering into hallways during a school shooting. Current suicidal thoughts are less frequent and persistent. Current depressive symptoms have been subsyndromal (though not entirely absent) for about 7 months. Specifically, the patient currently denies experiencing depressive symptoms for more than a few hours every couple of weeks but rates their chance of self-harm in the next three months at 50% (suicide attempt chance at 0%). They report minimal alcohol and marijuana use. Notably, the patient expresses resistance to treatment, stating that \"getting better means getting fat\" and feeling they need to \"stay sad for a while longer\".",

    "model_thoughts":"**Considering psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nThey asked for a structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses, not necessarily provisional. I could list OCPD as secondary due to perfectionism. It's distinct from OCD, but childhood perfectionism and ritualistic self-punishment might relate. There's minimal substance use that doesn't fit here. I wonder if \"Other specified feeding or eating disorder\" or \"Other specified depressive disorder\" might work, but I'm unsure about \"Adjustment disorder\" or \"Autism spectrum disorder.\" \"Tic disorder\" seems unlikely, and I\u2019m considering anxiety regarding contaminated air, which could relate to contamination OCD or illness anxiety disorder.\n\n**Evaluating compulsive behaviors**\n\nThere seem to be compulsions involved, so maybe \"Somatic symptom disorder\" isn't the right choice. I wonder if \"Body-focused repetitive behavior disorder\" fits, particularly for hair pulling. However, hair pulling might lean more towards self-harm than compulsion. If trichotillomania (F63.3) is present, it suggests intentional injury, not just tension relief. There's a chance it could relate to nonsuicidal self-injury, but the appropriate ICD-10 coding doesn't fit. I need to clarify that excoriation disorder is F42.4 while trichotillomania is F63.3\u2014that's a bit confusing!\n\n**Examining diagnostic options**\n\nI'm considering whether to include trichotillomania as a secondary diagnosis since there's hair pulling, though it's unclear if it fully meets the criteria. I think it could relate to self-harm, likely tied to NSSI or anxiety. It might be worth including an \"Unspecified eating disorder\" (F50.9), but specifying anorexia seems better. I wonder about \"Unspecified anxiety disorder\" (F41.9) or \"Other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder\" for OCD-like symptoms, but I\u2019m leaning away from that. For depression, maybe \"Major depressive disorder, single episode, in partial remission\" (F32.4) is the best fit here.\n\n**Selecting primary diagnoses**\n\nIt seems like the patient might have \"Obsessive-compulsive disorder\" as the primary diagnosis, following that with \"Anorexia nervosa, restricting type\" as secondary, and possibly \"Major depressive disorder, single episode, in partial remission\" as the third. For the fourth, \"Generalized anxiety disorder\" feels uncertain since there's no clear evidence of generalized worry. They exhibit longstanding anxiety and perfectionism, potentially manifesting as worry. Maybe \"Unspecified anxiety disorder\" would capture baseline anxiety, but it's likely redundant given the OCD presence. Since OCD is the most prominent and impairing symptom, that will be the primary diagnosis. Now I need to think of four additional diagnoses.\n\n**Determining additional diagnoses**\n\nI need to finalize the diagnoses, already having anorexia and major depressive disorder. For two more, I\u2019m considering \"Other specified feeding or eating disorder\" or \"Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder.\" The patient shows significant anxiety about contaminated air and engages in compulsive behaviors, indicating OCD. Additionally, there\u2019s a history of depression and self-harm. Given the nuances, I might lean towards \"Major depressive disorder, single episode, in partial remission\" for the current situation. I also need to consider \"Generalized anxiety disorder,\" but it could overlap with OCD. I\u2019ll choose wisely for the top five diagnoses!\n\n**Finalizing diagnoses and codes**\n\nI\u2019m evaluating potential diagnoses for a patient, making sure to align with ICD-10 codes. I know \"Obsessive-compulsive disorder\" is primary, along with \"Anorexia nervosa\" and \"Depressive disorder.\" As for additional diagnoses, I'm pondering options like \"Unspecified anxiety disorder\" and possibly exploring \"Other specified obsessive-compulsive disorder.\" However, I need to avoid overlaps and ensure they\u2019re all valid choices based on the details from the vignette. Ultimately, I\u2019ll list the top five diagnoses with corresponding codes while sticking to the provided information!\n\n**Mapping diagnoses and consideration**\n\nI'm thinking through the possible diagnoses for this case. I\u2019m weighing whether \"Anorexia nervosa\" or \"Other specified feeding or eating disorder (OSFED)\" is more appropriate, especially since the current BMI is normal. Given the history, it might be best to consider \"Anorexia nervosa, restricting type, in partial remission.\" I\u2019m also contemplating other anxiety-related disorders, but deciding on five distinct and supported diagnoses is tricky. I\u2019m finally settling on a list, prioritizing OCD, anorexia, MDD, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder among others to provide a structured set of diagnoses!\n\n**Evaluating possible diagnoses**\n\nI'm considering the diagnoses for this 18-year-old patient experiencing self-harm and treatment resistance. First, is there evidence for Borderline Personality Disorder? No. For conditions like Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder, Somatic Symptom Disorder, or specific phobias? Not enough. Anxiety disorders seem present, and I might support OCD with traits. I'm determining the best five diagnoses while being careful not to overlap or make unsupported claims. I\u2019m settling on Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Anorexia Nervosa, Major Depressive Disorder, and an unspecified anxiety disorder to round it out.\n\n**Refining diagnoses for the patient**\n\nI'm trying to determine the most accurate diagnosis for this 18-year-old. Considering \"Other specified feeding or eating disorder, atypical anorexia nervosa\" seems appropriate since they have a normal weight but a history of anorexia. However, I think \"Anorexia nervosa, in partial remission\" might fit better due to current behaviors. Their obsessions, counting rituals, and self-harming behaviors suggest OCD. I need to choose the correct ICD-10 codes, including OCD, anorexia, major depressive disorder, an unspecified anxiety disorder, and maybe trichotillomania or another specified disorder.\n\n**Selecting potential diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m considering potential diagnoses for the case. It seems like \"Obsessive-compulsive disorder\" fits best with mixed obsessional thoughts and acts (F42.2). For the eating disorder, I think \"Anorexia nervosa, restricting type\" (F50.01) could be appropriate as well. Major depressive disorder in partial remission (F32.4) looks suitable too. I might include unspecified anxiety disorder (F41.9) and trichotillomania (F63.3) for hair-pulling behaviors. Now my finalized list looks like this: OCD, anorexia, depression, unspecified anxiety, and trichotillomania.\n\n**Finalizing diagnoses**\n\nI'm thinking through the possible diagnoses. For hair pulling, it isn't recurrent or causing loss, but I could consider \"Other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder\" (F42.8). However, for the eating disorder, I believe \"Anorexia nervosa, restricting type, in partial remission\" (F50.01) fits better based on the history. For depression, \"Major depressive disorder, single episode, in partial remission\" (F32.4) seems appropriate. Lastly, I might go with \"Other specified feeding or eating disorder (atypical anorexia nervosa)\" (F50.89) as the fourth. Let's finalize that list and ensure it meets all criteria!\n\n**Finalizing diagnosis list**\n\nI'm working on establishing a clear diagnosis list. I think I should go with \"Obsessive-compulsive disorder\" (F42.2) for the first, as it captures key symptom clusters. Next, I'll list \"Anorexia nervosa, restricting type, in partial remission\" (F50.01). For the third, \"Major depressive disorder, single episode, in partial remission\" (F32.4) seems fitting. I'll include \"Anxiety disorder, unspecified\" (F41.9) for the fourth, and finally, \"Trichotillomania\" (F63.3) for the fifth spot. Let\u2019s finalize that!\n\n**Refining diagnosis list**\n\nI'm working on finalizing a list of diagnoses. I'm considering \"Obsessive-compulsive disorder\" (F42.2), \"Anorexia nervosa, restricting type, in partial remission\" (F50.01), and \"Major depressive disorder, single episode, in partial remission\" (F32.4). For the fourth, I might go with \"Other specified anxiety disorder\" (F41.8) to capture relevant symptoms, and for the fifth, I could include \"Other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder\" (F42.8) for hair-pulling behavior. Let's keep refining this to ensure accuracy!\n\n**Finalizing diagnoses list**\n\nI've narrowed down to five likely diagnoses: \n\n1. Obsessive-compulsive disorder, mixed obsessional thoughts and acts - F42.2  \n2. Anorexia nervosa, restricting type, in partial remission - F50.01  \n3. Major depressive disorder, single episode, in partial remission - F32.4  \n4. Anxiety disorder, unspecified - F41.9  \n5. Trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) - F63.3  \n\nI believe this selection accurately represents the symptoms and nuances from the vignette, while aiming for the best fit within the provided guidelines.\n\n**Refining diagnoses list**\n\nI need to finalize the top five diagnoses based on the information about the patient. \n\nI'm considering: \n\n1. Obsessive-compulsive disorder, mixed obsessional thoughts and acts - F42.2  \n2. Anorexia nervosa, restricting type, in partial remission - F50.01  \n3. Major depressive disorder, single episode, in partial remission - F32.4  \n4. Generalized anxiety disorder - F41.1 (or possibly Unspecified anxiety disorder - F41.9)  \n5. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder - F60.5 (or Trichotillomania - F63.3)  \n\nIt\u2019s important to choose accurately based on the details I have.\n\n**Finalizing potential diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m working on identifying the top five likely diagnoses based on the patient\u2019s history and symptoms.\n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019m considering:  \n\n1. Obsessive-compulsive disorder, mixed obsessional thoughts and acts - F42.2  \n2. Anorexia nervosa, restricting type, in partial remission - F50.01  \n3. Major depressive disorder, single episode, in partial remission - F32.4  \n4. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder - F60.5  \n5. Anxiety disorder, unspecified - F41.9  \n\nI know OCPD might seem speculative, but it connects with perfectionism and self-punishment behaviors. I'll make sure my choices reflect the most likely conditions based on the information provided.\n\n**Finalizing the diagnosis list**\n\nI\u2019m wrapping up the list of the top five most likely diagnoses based on the patient\u2019s symptoms. Here\u2019s the formatted output:\n\n1. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (mixed obsessional thoughts and acts) - F42.2  \n2. Anorexia nervosa, restricting type (in partial remission) - F50.01  \n3. Major depressive disorder, single episode (in partial remission) - F32.4  \n4. Unspecified anxiety disorder - F41.9  \n5. Trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) - F63.3  \n\nThis adheres to the requested ICD-10 F-codes format and reflects the primary and secondary diagnoses correctly.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Evaluating psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI'm looking at psychiatric diagnoses related to insomnia disorder, which is classified as a sleep-wake disorder. I found F51.01 in some references, but my notes say in ICD-10 it\u2019s F51.0. In DSM-5, insomnia disorder is marked as G47.00, though it\u2019s noted that I can include F51.01. I need to focus on the most relevant conditions\u2014definitely major depressive disorder (MDD), likely with psychotic features, along with insomnia and some alcohol use concerns, though maybe not severe.\n\n**Considering potential diagnoses**\n\nI'm evaluating possible diagnoses, starting with major depressive disorder with psychotic features as the primary concern. I also wonder about comorbid conditions, like mild alcohol use disorder, but I realize it might not fit since she only increased her intake slightly and not significantly enough to meet the criteria. Suicidal ideation isn\u2019t a diagnosis, and I find that including both MDD severe with and without psychotic features might mix things up. I need to stick to the top 5 most likely diagnoses.\n\n**Assessing potential diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to treat insomnia\u2014whether to view it as comorbid or symptomatic. However, it seems she probably doesn\u2019t have a separate insomnia disorder. I think about other possible diagnoses like \"Other specified depressive disorder\" but decide against it. \"Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder\" feels too vague, and while I consider medical conditions contributing to depression, the physical exam is normal. I\u2019ll include \"Adjustment disorder with depressed mood\" since work stress might be a factor, but it's less likely given the full MDD diagnosis.\n\n**Determining likely diagnoses**\n\nI think the most plausible diagnosis is \"Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe, with mood-congruent psychotic features.\" This fits well given her symptoms. I also consider \"Delusional disorder, persecutory type\" due to her fixed beliefs about being arrested related to dog deaths. Other options like \"Bipolar I disorder\" and \"Schizoaffective disorder\" could be relevant but might not be as likely. Ultimately, the situation points strongly toward major depressive disorder with psychotic features as the best fit.\n\n**Finalizing diagnosis list**\n\nI\u2019m working on a differential diagnosis list. The most plausible primary diagnosis is \"Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe, with mood-congruent psychotic features\" (F32.3).

I see the potential for listings like \"Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, severe, with catatonia,\" but that lacks a specific code, so we need to include both MDD and catatonia codes. \n\nWe need to identify the top five likely diagnoses, considering possibilities like catatonia due to a medical condition, schizophrenia, and severe MDD. The patient's background mainly indicates MDD, noting they've been off their medication.\n\n**Analyzing the vignette**\n\nI need to pick the top five diagnoses based on this detailed vignette. The patient is a 36-year-old female with a history of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) diagnosed at 20. She stopped Zoloft six months ago due to insurance issues. Her bizarre behaviors include not eating, staring blankly, and neglecting hygiene. She's mute during assessment, showing possible catatonic features like negativism or stupor. Her waxy flexibility and posturing further support the possibility of catatonia, likely associated with a severe depressive episode from her medication cessation.\n\n**Diagnosing Major Depressive Disorder**\n\nTo diagnose Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), I need to confirm depressed mood or anhedonia along with other symptoms lasting for at least two weeks. However, we don\u2019t have this information provided. The patient\u2019s symptoms of poor hygiene, immobility, and mutism probably indicate severe depression but could also suggest catatonia, possibly linked to another disorder. \n\nCurrently, there\u2019s no evidence of psychosis or mania, which leads me to consider that the diagnosis might be unspecified catatonia (potentially coded F06.1). I need to check the codes to clarify this.\n\n**Clarifying diagnostic codes**\n\nI\u2019m sorting through the coding for catatonia and its associations. In DSM-5, \"Catatonia associated with another mental disorder\" uses F06.1, while \"Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition\" can also be F06.1. I might list \"Catatonia associated with major depressive disorder\" as primary and then include MDD recurrent, severe as a secondary diagnosis. \n\nI need a top-five list and shouldn't repeat codes, but it's tricky. The patient\u2019s lack of evidence for current MDD makes things complex, so I have to stick with what's provided.\n\n**Determining top diagnoses**\n\nI'm exploring the various diagnostic codes related to catatonia and mood disorders. ICD-10\u2019s F05 is for delirium, but DSM-5 includes catatonia in neurocognitive disorders. I can include \"Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type\" (F25.1) as well. I'm weighing whether to prioritize catatonia associated with another mental disorder or recurrent MDD with catatonic features. \n\nThe patient\u2019s symptoms need careful consideration. I need to reflect the most likely diagnoses and adhere to the requirement of unique codes. So, I'd likely list: \"Catatonia associated with MDD\" as primary, followed by other relevant diagnoses.\n\n**Formulating top diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m trying to determine the best diagnostic codes based on the case details. I'd like to organize the findings into a structured list with specific ICD-10 codes. I can include both catatonia and major depressive disorder in my final list, which needs to consist of five lines.\n\n1. Catatonia associated with major depressive disorder - F06.1  \n2. Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode, severe - F33.2  \n3. Schizophrenia (with catatonia) - F20.9  \n4. Bipolar I disorder, current episode depressed, severe - F31.4  \n5. Delirium - F05  \n\nThis format adheres to the requirements with appropriate diagnoses and codes!\n\n**Ranking potential diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m working through the potential diagnoses based on the case details. The top five I\u2019m considering are:\n\n1. Catatonia associated with another mental disorder - F06.1  \n2. Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode, severe - F33.2  \n3. Schizophrenia - F20.9  \n4. Bipolar I disorder, current episode depressed, severe - F31.4  \n5. Delirium - F05  \n\nI'll ensure that these codes are unique where possible, though some diagnoses may share the same code. It's important to rule out other conditions while focusing on the most likely diagnoses.\n\n**Deciding on diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m weighing my options for the diagnoses. I think I should go with:\n\n1. Catatonia associated with major depressive disorder - F06.1  \n2. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe, without psychotic features - F33.2  \n3. Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition - F06.1  \n4. Schizophrenia - F20.9  \n5. Bipolar I disorder, current episode depressed, severe, without psychotic features - F31.4  \n\nIt seems okay to have duplicates in the coding since the question allows that. I want to ensure it accurately reflects the case and provides the necessary clarity.\n\n**Finalizing diagnosis list**\n\nI\u2019m considering the various diagnoses and codes. Here\u2019s my final list:\n\n1. Catatonia associated with another mental disorder (likely major depressive disorder) - F06.1  \n2. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe, without psychotic features - F33.2  \n3. Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition - F06.1  \n4. Schizophrenia - F20.9  \n5. Bipolar I disorder, current episode depressed, severe, without psychotic features - F31.4  \n\nIt\u2019s important to ensure the formatting is correct, and I think I\u2019ve got it laid out neatly!",

    "vignette":"Nadine was a 15-year-old girl whose mother brought her for a psychiatric evaluation to help with her long-standing shyness.\n\nAlthough Nadine was initially reluctant to say much about herself, she said she felt constantly tense. She added that the anxiety had been \u201creally bad\u201d for several years and was often accompanied by episodes of dizziness and crying. She was generally unable to speak in any situation outside of her home or school classes. She refused to leave her house alone for fear of being forced to interact with someone. She was especially anxious around other teenagers, but she had also become \u201ctoo nervous\u201d to speak to adult neighbors she had known for years. She said it felt impossible to walk into a restaurant and order from \u201ca stranger at the counter\u201d for fear of being humiliated. She also felt constantly on her guard, needing to avoid the possibility of getting attacked, a strategy that really only worked when she was alone in her home.\n\nNadine tried to conceal her crippling anxiety from her parents, typically telling them that she \u201cjust didn\u2019t feel like\u201d going out. Feeling trapped and incompetent, Nadine said she contemplated suicide \u201call the time.\u201d In the month before her mother finally brought her in for a psychiatric evaluation, Nadine had begun to cut herself on her thighs to \u201cfeel pain and relieve stress.\u201d No one in the family was aware of this development.\n\nNadine had always been \u201cshy\u201d and had been teased at recess since she started kindergarten. The teasing had escalated to outright bullying by the time she was in seventh grade. The bullying took on a cultural\/racially motivated undertone; Nadine and her family were of a different ethnicity than the vast majority of her schoolmates. For 2 years, day after difficult day, Nadine\u2019s peers turned on her \u201clike a snarling wolf pack,\u201d calling her \u201cstupid,\u201d \u201cugly,\u201d and \u201ccrazy.\u201d Not infrequently, one of them would stare at her and tell her she would be better off committing suicide. One girl (the ringleader, as well as a former elementary school chum) hit Nadine on one occasion, giving her a black eye. Nadine did not fight back. This event was witnessed by an adult neighbor, who told Nadine\u2019s mother. When Nadine\u2019s mother asked her about the incident, Nadine denied it, saying she had \u201cfallen\u201d on the street. She did, however, mention to her mother \u201cin passing\u201d that she wanted to switch schools, but her delivery was so offhand that at the time, her mother casually advised against the switch. Nadine suffered on, sobbing herself to sleep most nights and wishing that she would not wake up.\n\nFull of hope and ideas of escape from the bullies and their narrowness, Nadine transferred to a specialty arts high school for ninth grade. Although the bullying ceased, her anxiety symptoms paradoxically worsened. She felt even more unable to venture into public spaces and felt increasingly embarrassed by her inability to develop the sort of independence typical of a 15-year-old. She said she had begun to spend whole weekends \u201ctrapped\u201d in her home and had become scared to even read by herself in the local park. Nadine\u2019s social anxiety had evolved into true agoraphobia. She had nightly nightmares about the bullies in her old school. Her preoccupation with suicide grew.\n\nHer parents had thought she would outgrow being shy and sought psychiatric help for her only after a teacher remarked that her anxiety and social isolation were keeping her from making the sort of grades and doing the sort of extracurricular activities that were necessary to get into a good college.\n\nNadine described her mother as loud, excitable, aggressive, and \u201ca little frightening.\u201d Her father was a successful tax attorney who worked long hours. Nadine described him as shy in social situations (\u201cHe\u2019s more like me\u201d). Nadine said she and her father sometimes joked that the goal of any evening was to avoid tipping the mother into a rage. Nadine added that she \u201cnever wanted to be anything like her mother.\u201d",

    "vignette":"Ursula Norman, a 32-year-old nurse, was brought to an emergency department 6 days after giving birth. Her husband stated that she had been behaving very strangely and that she had become convinced that she had smothered and killed her baby.\n\nHer husband reported that after a normal pregnancy and uncomplicated delivery, Ms. Norman had happily gone home with their first child. On the third day after delivery, however, her mood and affect began to shift rapidly between elation and weepiness. She became irritable and anxious. She slept only an hour a night, even when her baby was asleep. Her behavior became increasingly bizarre, with overactivity and agitation. Her speech was rapid and digressive. Although not previously a religious person, she became convinced that God was speaking through her and that she had special powers that could solve the problems of the world. She told her husband that she could identify evil people by looking into their eyes and had begun to worry that she was surrounded by evil people, including her own mother. Most disturbing for her, whenever she was out of sight of her son, she became totally convinced that she had smothered him, and no one could convince her otherwise.\n\nMs. Norman had a history of three episodes of major depressive disorder in her teens and early 20s. These episodes resolved with psychotherapy and antidepressant medication. She also had a psychiatric admission for mania 3 years prior to the delivery of her child, after a flight from Asia to Europe. Following treatment with antipsychotic medication, she became depressed for several months. Although a diagnosis of bipolar disorder was discussed at this time, she was reluctant to accept this label, attributing the episode to stress and jet lag. She had discontinued the psychiatric medication in anticipation of getting pregnant.\n\nMs. Norman\u2019s own mother had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital shortly after the birth of her first child. This episode was not talked about in the family, and there were few other details. She had no other family history of note.\n\nUntil just before delivery of her child, Ms. Norman had been a highly functional nurse in a renal unit. Her husband was the head of a sales team, and they lived in comfortable social circumstances. She had no history of illicit drug use and, prior to pregnancy, drank only 2 or 3 units of alcohol a week.\n\nOn mental status examination, Ms. Norman wandered around the room, seemingly unable to sit for more than a few moments. She was distractible and overtalkative, and demonstrated flight of ideas, flitting from one subject to another. Her mood was labile. At times she appeared happily euphoric. At other times she was tearful, and she could become quickly irritable when she felt she was not being understood. It was clear that she had a number of delusional beliefs but was unwilling to discuss most of them with the examiner. She did insist that she had already killed her own child, which led to several minutes of tears, but she returned to an edgy euphoria within a few minutes. She denied intent to harm herself or anyone else. She appeared inattentive, with poor concentration, but would not participate in formal cognitive testing.\n\nPhysical examination and laboratory testing results were all within normal limits.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Clarifying diagnosis names**\n\nI should think about including specifiers in diagnosis names, although they might not appear in ICD-10. It's essential to use the DSM-5-TR label. For instance, for Bipolar I, I can include phrases like \"current episode manic, severe, with psychotic features\" or \"with peripartum onset.\" \n\nI guess I\u2019ll draft names with codes:  \n1. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, with psychotic features, with peripartum onset - F31.2  \n2. Brief psychotic disorder, with postpartum onset - F23  \n3. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type - F25.0  \n4. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, with psychotic features - F33.3  \n5. Delusional disorder - F22.\n\n**Exploring diagnosis options**\n\nOkay, so F33.3 is \"Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe with psychotic symptoms.\" The postpartum onset specifier for MDD is \"with peripartum onset,\" and I can mention that alongside Delusional disorder, which has the code F22.  \n\nMaybe I should also consider \"Other specified bipolar and related disorder,\" but that might complicate things. If there's been previous mania, then Bipolar I is clear, and perhaps we can list it on its own. But they want five diagnoses!  \n\nI\u2019ll focus on differential diagnoses and avoid listing \u201cBipolar I disorder\u201d alongside \u201cHistory of major depressive disorder,\u201d since they shouldn't be separate. If the criteria for Bipolar I are met, then MDD won't be included as comorbid.\n\n**Evaluating bipolar and psychosis criteria**\n\nI need to weigh the differences between \"Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, with psychotic features\" and \"Bipolar I disorder, current episode mixed, with psychotic features.\" For the mixed features specifier, the criteria require mania plus at least three depressive symptoms. She shows tearfulness, guilt (possibly a delusion), anxiety, and irritability, but I\u2019m uncertain if she has a depressed mood most of the day, which could complicate the diagnosis.  \n\nAdditionally, postpartum psychosis might cause confusion and disorientation. She's having issues with attention and concentration, which could suggest delirium, though physical exams and labs are normal, which makes me wonder about postpartum delirium. There's also the fact that distractibility can be part of mania, so considering \"Delirium\" (F05) might make sense.\n\n**Sorting through differential diagnoses**\n\nI see that delirium due to a known physiological condition falls under F05, and DSM-5 also codes delirium the same way. If we're considering postpartum delirium, it usually relates to infections, but there aren\u2019t any here. She does seem distractible and inattentive, which could appear delirious, but it might just be mania.  \n  \nI think it makes sense to list \"Delirium\" as a differential diagnosis, but I should focus more on the likely ones.  \n\nSo, for the top five diagnoses:  \n1. Bipolar I disorder, manic with psychotic features, peripartum onset  \n2. Brief psychotic disorder, postpartum onset  \n3. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type  \n4. Schizophrenia or schizophreniform  \n5. Delusional disorder or MDD with psychotic features  \n\nI need to ponder which of these is most plausible postpartum!\n\n**Compiling final diagnoses list**\n\nFor postpartum psychosis, I should think through various diagnoses. Although postpartum severe MDD might present with mood lability, mania suggests that MDD is less likely. Therefore, I consider \"Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, with psychotic features\" as primary. \n\nNow for the secondary diagnoses:  \n1. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, with psychotic features, with peripartum onset - F31.2  \n2. Brief psychotic disorder, with postpartum onset - F23  \n3. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type - F25.0  \n4. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe with psychotic features, with peripartum onset - F33.3  \n5. Delusional disorder - F22  \n\nThis list should align well with the criteria!\n\n**Evaluating differential diagnoses**\n\nI'm considering various differential diagnoses for postpartum psychosis. \"Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, with psychotic features\" seems to be the primary choice. I also see \"Brief psychotic disorder with postpartum onset\" as a possible secondary. Schizoaffective disorder and other psychotic disorders could fit, but I need to prioritize based on plausibility.\n\nI'll list my final five:  \n1. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, with psychotic features - F31.2  \n2. Brief psychotic disorder, with postpartum onset - F23  \n3. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type - F25.0  \n4. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition (with delusions) - F06.2  \n5. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe with psychotic features - F33.3  \n\nThis should align with the guidelines!\n\n**Determining differential diagnoses**\n\nI'm assessing the differential diagnoses for postpartum psychosis. Given the presence of mania and previous episodes, \"Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, with psychotic features\" seems the strongest candidate. I also need to identify four secondary diagnoses. \n\nMy final list appears to be:  \n1. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, with psychotic features, with peripartum onset - F31.2  \n2. Brief psychotic disorder, with postpartum onset - F23  \n3. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type - F25.0  \n4. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe with psychotic features (with peripartum onset) - F33.3  \n5. Schizophreniform disorder - F20.81  \n\nThis should align appropriately with the guidelines!\n\n**Finalizing diagnoses list**\n\nI\u2019m putting together the final list of psychiatric diagnoses based on the information.

The semiology of the seizure was such that there would be an aura-tingling sensation in limbs, ringing in ears, and fearfulness for less than a minute, followed by focal onset seizure-twisting of the upper limb and head toward left with stiffening and jerky movements of all four limbs with unconsciousness associated with tongue bite, injury due to fall and episodes also occurred during sleep. He would be confused for a few minutes after gaining consciousness, complain of headaches, and would sleep at times. He had stopped going to school for 4 years and would refuse to visit his relatives because of fear of a seizure episode. He was treated with sodium valproate up to 800\u2009mg for a year, 2 years back with irregular follow-ups.

    "model_thoughts":"**Analyzing coding options**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about the accuracy of F19, which codes for mental and behavioral disorders caused by multiple drug use. It doesn't seem right. Maybe I should look into using F15 or DSM-5-TR with ICD-10-CM since the user asked about ICD-10 F-codes and related to substance-induced disorders. For example, \"Substance\/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder\" uses substance-specific codes. But for \"Other substance-induced psychotic disorder,\u201d F19.151 fits better. Meanwhile, F06.2 might work for medication-induced issues, depending on the vignette details.\n\n**Considering psychosis onset**\n\nI'm analyzing the situation where psychosis develops after switching anticonvulsant medication. The phenomenon is called \"forced normalization,\" where psychosis can emerge as seizures are controlled. However, the EEG is still slow, which complicates things. The patient became seizure-free six days before experiencing psychosis after introducing levetiracetam. Acute onset within four days points to a possible medication side effect. The presence of anxiety and other symptoms suggests differentiating between Substance\/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder and organic disorders in ICD-10, like F06.2 for organic delusional disorder.\n\n**Evaluating potential disorders**\n\nI\u2019m exploring different psychiatric diagnoses for the patient, like \"Brief Psychotic Disorder\" (ICD-10 F23) or secondary causes. Another option is \"Psychotic Disorder due to another medical condition,\" specifically epilepsy (F06.2). I\u2019m also considering \"Delirium due to medication,\" especially given the earlier drowsiness. However, the psychosis emerged after that resolved. There\u2019s also the possibility of \"Postictal Psychosis,\" which falls under the same medical conditions category. Still, he\u2019s been seizure-free for six days, making this diagnosis tricky to pin down.\n\n**Determining likely diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m considering the patient's psychotic symptoms and their timeline. They experienced increased seizure frequency before optimization, but none after starting valproate. Given the context, postictal psychosis seems unlikely. While I could look into \"Schizophreniform Disorder\" or \"Schizophrenia,\" the acute onset and lack of symptoms lasting over a month weigh against it. I think \"Psychotic Disorder due to Epilepsy\" is primary, but I\u2019ll prioritize medication-induced psychosis related to levetiracetam. I\u2019ll compile a list of five potential diagnoses with F-codes.\n\n**Identifying appropriate F-codes**\n\nI'm diving into potential diagnoses for the patient, considering options like F23 for acute polymorphic psychotic disorder. Symptoms resemble schizophrenia, and since the issues arose after starting levetiracetam, I'm leaning towards medication-induced psychosis. Other possibilities include specific phobias related to seizure fear or generalized anxiety disorder. However, based on the prompt asking for DSM-5-TR codes and using ICD-10-CM, I think we'll prioritize F19.959 for medication-induced psychotic disorder. The case heavily suggests this as the primary diagnosis.\n\n**Determining F-codes for psychosis**\n\nI'm analyzing the appropriate F-codes to categorize the patient's psychosis, considering both ICD-10 and DSM-5 guidelines. The focus is on the distinctions between codes for medication-induced versus those for medical conditions. I\u2019m torn between using F06.0 for organic hallucinosis and F06.2 for psychotic disorder due to another medical condition. However, given the medication history, using F19.959 for substance-induced psychotic disorder seems fitting. Overall, I need to ensure I'm presenting a coherent and accurate diagnosis in line with DSM-5-TR specifications.\n\n**Analyzing psychosis diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m exploring the potential diagnoses for the patient's psychosis, mainly considering medication-induced psychotic disorder due to levetiracetam, which could correspond with F19.151 or F19.959. There's some debate over using codes like F06.2 for psychotic disorders related to medical conditions, but I\u2019m inclined to prioritize medication-induced origins since they developed shortly after medication adjustments. I\u2019m weighing the importance of precision in coding to capture the clinical situation accurately while fulfilling diagnostic requirements.\n\n**Identifying psychotic disorder codes**\n\nI\u2019m working through the appropriate ICD-10-CM codes for substance-induced psychotic disorders. I realize F19.951 might apply, alongside others like F19.959 for unspecified cases. Comparing with DSM-5 codes is tricky since those seem to have different specifications. It appears the patient's psychosis could be due to levetiracetam, so I\u2019m leaning toward F19.151. I want to prioritize correct coding while establishing differential diagnoses based on the specifics of the case, ensuring it aligns with recognized standards.\n\n**Selecting psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI'm identifying the top DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses, focusing on \"Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition,\" with relevant codes like F06.2 for delusions and F06.0 for hallucinations. I'm also considering including brief psychotic disorder (F23) and schizophreniform disorder (F20.81). For anxiety-related issues, agoraphobia (F40.00) or specific phobia (F40.298) might be appropriate due to the patient's long-term avoidance of situations linked to seizures. I need to craft a well-structured list of these diagnoses while ensuring all codes are accurately represented.\n\n**Determining psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI'm working on identifying the top psychiatric diagnoses, starting with \"Substance\/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder\" which seems most relevant here, using the code F19.151 for hallucinations. Next, I'm considering \"Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition\" with code F06.2, and \"Brief Psychotic Disorder\" using F23. Schizophreniform Disorder will be F20.81, and finally, I'll include Agoraphobia with F40.00. I'm verifying which codes best fit the symptoms without excessive duplication while keeping in mind the presence of hallucinations and delusions.\n\n**Choosing psychiatric codes**\n\nI\u2019m working through the possible codes for substance-induced psychotic disorder, considering options like F19.5 for multiple drug use, but F23 might be simpler. I want to map DSM-5-TR diagnoses correctly to ICD-10, possibly using F19.951 for hallucinations or F19.959 if unspecified. Codes I\u2019m verifying include \"Brief Psychotic Disorder\" as F23, \"Schizophreniform Disorder\" as F20.81, and \"Agoraphobia\" using F40.00. Ultimately, I'll lean toward F19.959 to cover both symptoms without confusion. Let's make sure each option is accurate!\n\n**Determining psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m looking at various codes for alcohol-induced psychotic disorder. F10.951 relates to alcohol use with psychotic symptoms, while F10.159 is for alcohol abuse. I need to ensure I\u2019m aligning DSM-5 codes with ICD-10 correctly. Considering the context, F19.959 seems best for medication-induced issues. I also need to evaluate secondary diagnoses, choosing F06.2 for a psychotic disorder due to another condition and F40.00 for agoraphobia. My final list of top diagnoses will reflect these choices accurately!\n\n**Evaluating anxiety and psychotic diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing possible diagnoses for the case, considering \u201cSeparation anxiety disorder\u201d or \u201cSpecific phobia\u201d might fit, but the focus is on fear of seizures, not separation. I\u2019m pondering listing \u201cOther specified anxiety disorder\u201d (F41.8) or \u201cAgoraphobia\u201d (F40.00). Additionally, I need to think about including \u201cAnxiety disorder due to another medical condition\u201d (F06.4), especially since the anxiety seems tied to seizure episodes. Ultimately, it\u2019s essential to ensure the top five diagnoses are properly supported and justified!",

They describe their living situation as \"overwhelming\" due to parental boundary issues, though they maintain a supportive romantic relationship since 2019. Their psychiatric history includes diagnoses of MDD and GAD at age 15-16, PTSD in 2016 following emotional abuse by high school friends, and ADHD in 2018 (without neuropsychological evaluation). Current medications include Lisdexamfetamine 50mg (since 2018), various supplements, and a contraceptive injection. They previously tried multiple antidepressants (2011-2015) but discontinued each after approximately two weeks due to suicidal ideation and, in one case, motor disturbances. The patient consumes alcohol socially (3-5 drinks monthly) and has been vaping marijuana 1-3 times weekly for three months primarily to aid sleep and manage anxiety. The patient's primary symptoms onset around age 5 with intrusive visualizations of falling down stairs along with perfectionism through rewriting notes until they felt \"just right\". Currently, they experience significant distress when surroundings are not in the \"right spot\", spending up to 12 hours reorganizing belongings without breaks, which would cause severe distress if interrupted. This \"not just right\" feeling impairs their ability to meet deadlines, complete job applications, and fulfill social obligations. They also engage in checking behaviors when packing (counting socks repeatedly, checking for essential items) and experience distressing sexual intrusive thoughts. Additionally, the patient exhibits skin-picking behaviors, spending over an hour picking at ingrown hairs until bleeding, scratching their neck and jaw during conversations, and tearing at cuticles, with symptoms worsening during periods of anxiety. They've attempted to stop by wearing pants constantly but have been unsuccessful. The patient has a significant history of depression with three past suicide attempts (overdoses in 2014, 2015, and 2017) and self-injury through cutting (stopped in 2017). They currently experience passive suicidal ideation, anhedonia, decreased appetite, sleep difficulties, psychomotor agitation, feelings of worthlessness, and concentration problems, though they report 0% chance of self-harm in the next three months. Social anxiety manifests as persistent fear of judgment and rejection, with distressing rumination about social interactions and excessive reassurance-seeking that has cost them friendships. The patient also reported past sexual abuse by a boyfriend for 4-5 months but denied PTSD symptoms. They disclosed a history of binge eating episodes. During the binge, they ate more rapidly than normal and felt disgusted and embarrassed after. After these eating binges, pt fasted for ~3 days. These eating binges occurred <1 time per week, and the patient has not engaged in these behaviors in the past 2 months.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Considering psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about presenting \"Other specified feeding or eating disorder (bulimia nervosa of low frequency\/limited duration)\" as the fifth diagnosis, but I'm weighing whether to include ADHD. The past diagnosis and current treatment for ADHD makes it a reasonable candidate. The user is looking for a structured list of DSM-5-TR diagnoses. I\u2019m thinking including OSFED is important to reflect eating pathology, although I\u2019m uncertain about some criteria details. I need to clarify binge eating characteristics too.\n\n**Analyzing binge-eating patterns**\n\nI\u2019m assessing the patient\u2019s binge-eating habits: they fast for about three days after binges, which occur less than once a week and haven\u2019t happened in the past two months. DSM-5 for bulimia requires binge episodes with compensatory behaviors weekly for three months, but that isn't met here. So, OSFED seems best, possibly as \"bulimia nervosa (of low frequency)\" or \"binge-eating disorder.\" The presence of fasting suggests compensatory behavior, but the lack of weight data complicates things. ADHD symptoms aren't core, but there's a previous diagnosis to consider.\n\n**Determining diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m trying to balance the rubric's emphasis on \"diagnostic flexibility\" without fabricating information. ADHD could be a differential diagnosis, but I need to focus on the top five likely diagnoses. Primary symptoms are OCD, with secondary symptoms of excoriation, depression, and social anxiety. I\u2019m considering including ADHD as the fifth option due to stimulant use since 2018. However, OSFED has some evidence too, though it's not recent. Ultimately, I need to choose based on what seems most likely from the available information.\n\n**Evaluating diagnostic criteria**\n\nI'm looking at the vignette, which suggests concentration problems likely stemming from depression, even though the person has been on lisdexamfetamine. I can't confirm ADHD without childhood symptoms. Regarding binge eating, the behavioral description shows it's been less frequent and absent lately, which could mean \"early remission.\" However, since full criteria were never met due to binge frequency being less than once a week, bulimia can\u2019t be diagnosed in remission. OSFED seems like a better fit, possibly as \"Other specified feeding or eating disorder\" in partial remission, but I lean towards listing it simply as OSFED with low frequency binge\/purge as the fifth option.\n\n**Structuring psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m creating a structured list of possible DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses based on the vignette. While ADHD relies more on prior diagnoses, I should focus on current symptoms. Primary concerns seem to be OCD, with secondary conditions like MDD, excoriation, and social anxiety. Given the primary symptoms of OCD and a history of depression and anxiety, I propose the following top five diagnoses:\n\n1. Obsessive-compulsive disorder - F42\n2. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, moderate - F33.1\n3. Excoriation (skin-picking) disorder - F42.4\n4. Social anxiety disorder - F40.10\n5. Other specified feeding or eating disorder - F50.89\n\nI\u2019m choosing to list MDD as moderate for now, but this may change if severity increases. I think focusing on OCD is crucial, as the vignette points to it being a primary concern.\n\n**Listing diagnoses and codes**\n\n1. Obsessive-compulsive disorder - F42  \n2. Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode, moderate - F33.1  \n3. Excoriation (skin-picking) disorder - F42.4  \n4. Social anxiety disorder (social phobia) - F40.10  \n5.

Because she appeared to be an \u201cemotionally disturbed person,\u201d a psychiatry consultation was requested.\n\nAccording to the police report, Ms. Allen threatened the driver with a knife, took control of the almost empty city bus, and crashed it. A more complete story was elicited from a friend of Ms. Allen\u2019s who had been on the bus but who had not been arrested. According to her, they had boarded the bus on their way to a nearby shopping mall. Ms. Allen became frustrated when the driver refused her dollar bills, instead demanding exact change. She looked in her purse, but instead of finding exact change, she pulled out a kitchen knife that she carried for protection. The driver fled, so she got into the empty seat and drove the bus across the street into a nearby parked car.\n\nOn examination, Ms. Allen was a handcuffed, heavyset young woman with a bandage on her forehead. She fidgeted and rocked back and forth in her chair. She appeared to be mumbling to herself. When asked what she was saying, the patient made momentary eye contact and just repeated, \u201cSorry, sorry.\u201d She did not respond to other questions.\n\nMore information was elicited from a psychiatrist who had come to the ER soon after the accident. He said that Ms. Allen and her friend were longtime residents at the state psychiatric hospital where he worked. They had just begun to take passes every week as part of an effort toward social remediation; it had been Ms. Allen\u2019s first bus ride without a staff member.\n\nAccording to the psychiatrist, Ms. Allen had received a diagnosis of \u201cchildhood-onset, treatment-resistant paranoid schizophrenia.\u201d She had started hearing voices by age 5 years. Big, strong, intrusive, and psychotic, she had been hospitalized almost constantly since age 11. Her auditory hallucinations generally consisted of a critical voice commenting on her behavior. Her thinking was concrete, but when relaxed she could be self-reflective. She was motivated to please and recurrently said her biggest goal was to \u201chave my own room in my own house with my own friends.\u201d The psychiatrist said that he was not sure what had caused her to pull out the knife. She had not been hallucinating lately and had been feeling less paranoid, but he wondered if she had been more psychotic than she had let on. It was possible that she was just impatient and irritated. The psychiatrist also believed that she had spent almost no period of life developing normally and so had very little experience with the real world.\n\nMs. Allen had been taking clozapine for 1 year, with good resolution of her auditory hallucinations. She had gained 35 pounds on the clozapine, but she had less trouble getting out of bed in the morning and was functioning at a higher level. She was hoping to get a job and live more independently, and the bus trip had been intended as a step in that direction. Because of these improvements and goals, she had insisted on continuing to take the clozapine despite the weight gain.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Analyzing potential diagnoses**\n\nI'm considering various diagnoses. The second most likely is catatonia linked to schizophrenia due to symptoms like mutism and rocking. Next, there\u2019s delirium, possibly from a head injury indicated by the bandage. There\u2019s also schizoaffective disorder or an intellectual disability to think about. It seems crucial to highlight \"Delirium due to another medical condition,\" especially since I should avoid listing \"rule out\" in the final diagnosis. I'll keep in mind the user asked for a list of diagnoses.\n\n**Considering diagnostic options**\n\nIt seems I should hesitate to include \"Delirium\" due to insufficient evidence. An \"Unspecified psychotic disorder\" (F29) might be an option, but given her history of chronic schizophrenia, that feels less likely. Since she's mute in the ER, I wonder if that points toward unspecified psychosis. My task is to provide the top five most likely diagnoses, which implies a differential rather than a final answer. I need to stick only to the information provided without adding speculative details, including about substance use unless indicated.\n\n**Evaluating possible diagnoses**\n\nIncluding substance-induced psychotic disorder feels like I'm fabricating without real evidence, but I could consider it as a differential if there's ambiguity. However, they want the most likely options. I think I should focus on more probable diagnoses supported by the information available. \"Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum\" (F29) and \"Adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct\" (F43.24) may fit better, especially since there's evidence of behavior changes following her first bus ride alone. It\u2019s important to only include what\u2019s clearly supported!\n\n**Assessing behavioral causes**\n\nI'm recognizing that her behavior likely stems from schizophrenia and cognitive deficits, but the stress of social remediation could also play a role. I wonder if I should consider \"Unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder\" (F43.9), but that feels off. \"Unspecified anxiety disorder\" might be an option given her anxious tendencies, but I think it's better to focus on conditions closely related to her diagnosis. I might need to explore possibilities like \"Intellectual developmental disorder\" or \"Borderline intellectual functioning,\" especially since her development has been limited. This could help fill out the requisite five diagnoses.\n\n**Reviewing psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m diving into various potential diagnoses for this case. It seems that schizophrenia is the primary diagnosis, given the symptoms. I\u2019ll consider secondary options like catatonia, which could relate to her mutism and rocking. Delirium might be a factor due to a possible head injury. I\u2019m debating if intellectual disability should be coded, but the evidence isn\u2019t strong. There\u2019s room for adjustment disorder too, but I\u2019m reconsidering other anxiety disorders that fit her symptoms. I need to narrow down to five plausible diagnoses while avoiding irrelevant or speculative ones.\n\n**Identifying differential diagnoses**\n\nI'm focusing on potential diagnoses for chronic psychosis beginning in childhood. Possible primary diagnoses include schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, alongside bipolar disorder with psychotic features. I'm also considering autism spectrum disorder and PTSD. However, the main goal is to meet the F-code requirement for psychiatric disorders. I might lean towards including schizophrenia with associated diagnoses like catatonia or delirium. While uncertainty exists, I need to select five plausible options based on evidence and clinical guidelines. This requires careful consideration of all symptoms presented.\n\n**Evaluating diagnoses for chronic psychosis**\n\nI'm trying to determine the most likely diagnoses for chronic psychosis starting in childhood. Key candidates include schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder with psychotic features. However, a secondary diagnosis might also encompass conditions like catatonia and delirium due to medical causes. I need to ensure my final list aligns with DSM-5-TR coding and presents plausible diagnoses based on the information available, focusing on schizophrenia as a primary diagnosis. I should avoid speculative choices to keep it clear and relevant.\n\n**Choosing psychiatric diagnoses for chronic psychosis**\n\nI'm trying to determine the top five psychiatric diagnoses for a case involving chronic psychosis. I\u2019m considering conditions like schizophrenia, catatonia associated with schizophrenia, unspecified intellectual disability, adjustment disorder due to stress, and delirium from a head injury. However, there\u2019s some uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of adjustment disorder, as the behavior might be better explained by schizophrenia itself. My list includes primary diagnoses and considers secondary options; it's critical to use the correct terms and coding from the DSM-5-TR.\n\n**Selecting top psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on the least speculative diagnoses for this case. I should include schizophrenia, along with other possibilities like unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and schizoaffective disorder. I'm considering factors such as catatonic symptoms and other related disorders. The top five I\u2019m leaning toward includes prominent diagnoses like schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and intellectual disabilities. I need to stick to the required format, listing each diagnosis with its corresponding ICD-10 F-code. This should be direct and straightforward without any extraneous comments.\n\n**Compiling psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI'm considering the most likely diagnoses based on the symptoms described. The primary diagnosis will be schizophrenia, which is clear. For secondary options, I'm evaluating potential conditions like unspecified catatonia, delirium, and intellectual disability. \n\nI may also consider conditions related to stress, though I'm not certain if acute stress disorder fully fits. I need to ensure the list is formatted correctly, with each diagnosis and its corresponding ICD-10 code clearly numbered. Each of the final five will reflect plausible mental health issues based on the case provided.\n\n**Finalizing diagnosis codes**\n\nI need to ensure that I'm using the correct ICD-10 codes for the diagnoses: F79 for unspecified intellectual disability, F06.1 for catatonia, F05 for delirium due to another condition, and F43.24 for adjustment disorder. \n\nThe primary diagnosis will be schizophrenia, listed as F20.9. I won't go into detail or reasoning; just focus on providing the final list clearly formatted. The specifiers might be tempting to include, but it\u2019s better to keep it concise. I'll just stick to the essential details.",

I need to focus on the top five ICD-10 codes for various disorders including Autism Spectrum Disorder and Language Disorder. I\u2019m comparing the ICD-10 codes to DSM-5-TR codes to ensure accuracy, and I'm carefully verifying these details. There\u2019s consideration for Social Pragmatic Communication Disorder as well. I'm weighing all this information to make a well-informed decision based on the indicators present.\n\n**Exploring disorder possibilities**\n\nI'm considering various possibilities like Tourette syndrome with coprolalia, which isn\u2019t in the DSM, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. I\u2019m questioning whether Stereotypic Movement Disorder (SMD) is distinct here. The behaviors she exhibits\u2014rocking and spinning when anxious, alongside self-slapping when stressed\u2014suggest stereotypy often seen in ASD. I\u2019m looking closely at the SMD criteria and how they may apply. It seems that SMD can coexist with ASD if self-injury or impairment is present, which adds complexity to the assessment.\n\n**Clarifying SMD diagnostics**\n\nI'm diving into the criteria for diagnosing Stereotypic Movement Disorder (SMD). The text specifies that SMD is only diagnosed when stereotypies aren\u2019t linked to another disorder. Yet, if these behaviors are severe and need clinical attention, a diagnosis might still apply. In the DSM-5, SMD is distinct from stereotypies in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). I need to verify that SMD can be diagnosed alongside ASD if self-injury is significant and requires attention. There's also mention of potential medical or genetic conditions associated.\n\n**Deciding on diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about the possibility of comorbidity here. The self-slapping behavior might be more of a complex motor tic due to Tourette's, suggesting that Stereotypic Movement Disorder (SMD) may not fit as well. Rocking and spinning definitely qualify as stereotypies, though. I should prioritize my top five diagnoses. I\u2019m considering including Tourette's and SMD, but also pondering other categories like tic disorder.

The situation was \u201cdepressing,\u201d he said, but nothing new.\n\nMr. Irvin also reported dissatisfaction with his relationships with women. He described a series of several-month-long relationships over the prior 10 years that ended despite his doing \u201ceverything I could\u201d and \u201cnever getting angry or yelling.\u201d His most recent relationship had been with an opera singer. He reported having gone to several operas and taken singing classes to impress her, even though he did not particularly enjoy music. That relationship had recently ended for unclear reasons. He said his mood and self-confidence were tied to his dating. Being single made him feel desperate, but desperation made it even harder to get a girlfriend. He said he felt trapped by that spiral.

For DSM-5, the matching diagnosis is \"sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, severe,\" and F13.20 also applies to moderate cases. Then I realize that F13.239 covers withdrawal disorders, but I need to be careful since withdrawal symptoms can vary. The user mentioned experiencing anxiety and \"the shakes,\" indicating some level of withdrawal.\n\n**Assessing personality disorders**\n\nIt's important not to fabricate anything; he clearly shows withdrawal symptoms, which could be relevant as a secondary issue. I'm considering dependent personality disorder traits like difficulty making decisions without reassurance and a strong need for relationships. His behavior of adjusting interests to please others and feeling helpless when alone aligns with this diagnosis, which is coded F60.7 in ICD-10. Although avoidant personality disorder crossed my mind, his relationships suggest dependent personality disorder fits better. His anxiety symptoms during treatment might also connect to this.\n\n**Evaluating possible disorders**\n\nI'm wondering if he could have generalized anxiety disorder since he hasn\u2019t described much worry, but he does show signs of sadness after a breakup. He has crying spells but denies other major depressive disorder symptoms. This might fit an adjustment disorder with depressed mood since the DSM-5 outlines specific criteria for that diagnosis.

The priority should lean towards the clearer issues, like substance use disorder and this potential depression.\n\n**Identifying potential diagnoses**\n\nHe is taking a high dose of alprazolam, which might lead to sedation or mood changes, but there's no evidence of current intoxication or depressive disorder caused by it. While he could have some dependent personality traits, it doesn't seem significant enough. I\u2019m considering possible diagnoses such as \"Benzodiazepine use disorder,\" \"Dependent personality disorder,\" and \"Adjustment disorder with depressed mood.\" I should also assess for \"Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal,\" but he denies chronic symptoms, so I need to focus on the top five most likely diagnoses with their associated F codes.\n\n**Identifying top diagnoses**\n\nI need to pin down the top five most likely diagnoses, combining one primary and four secondary. First, I consider \"Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, severe\" (F13.20) due to his alprazolam use. Next is \"Dependent personality disorder\" (F60.7). I include \"Adjustment disorder with depressed mood\" (F43.21) based on his recent breakup. Then, \"Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal\" (F13.239) makes sense due to his cutting back. Finally, I might speculate on \"Other specified depressive disorder\" (F32.8), but it remains complex. I need to prioritize based on the provided information.\n\n**Considering possible diagnoses**\n\nI'm evaluating whether \"Avoidant personality disorder\" fits due to low self-confidence and fear of rejection, but he does maintain relationships, which complicates that assumption. \"Dependent personality disorder\" still seems likely, along with \"Sedative\/hypnotic\/anxiolytic use disorder.\" I might include \"Unspecified anxiety disorder\" since he sought alprazolam for anxiety, even if the specifics are unclear. I also consider \"Adjustment disorder with depressed mood\" since he shows sadness from a breakup. It's essential to prioritize the most likely five diagnoses based on provided information.\n\nI'm considering whether to include \"Other specified depressive disorder\" or stick with \"Unspecified anxiety disorder,\" but since sadness is present, I lean towards the former. However, \"Adjustment disorder with depressed mood\" is already in the mix, and according to DSM guidelines, we typically wouldn\u2019t diagnose both. I need to narrow down to five diagnoses while considering comorbidity versus differential diagnoses. The list of five includes severe sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder and others, focusing on the most relevant diagnoses with their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes.\n\nI'm tasked with creating a structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses. Here\u2019s what I've come up with:\n\n1. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, severe (alprazolam) - F13.20  \n2. Dependent personality disorder - F60.7  \n3. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood - F43.21  \n4. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal - F13.239  \n5. Unspecified anxiety disorder - F41.9  \n\nI'll ensure this list aligns with the required format and includes accurate F codes. No reasoning or additional commentary needed!",

The patient was reportedly at a gas station causing a disturbance, speaking about how everyone in there was the devil and throwing items off the shelves. When officers arrived, the patient was aggressive and had to be tased. On arrival, the patient had to receive emergency IM medications of Haldol, Ativan, and Benadryl due to agitation. Psychiatry was consulted for psychosis. On psychiatric assessment, the patient is drowsy after having just received the emergency IM medications. However, he is irritable and hostile, telling the physician to \u201cfuck off\u201d and that \u201cthe devil is out to get you\u201d. He states he is \u201clike a God\u201d and that he was unfairly arrested.

    "model_thoughts":"**Analyzing substance coding**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the ICD-10 code F19, which indicates \"multiple drug use and use of other psychoactive substances.\" This could be relevant since it covers multiple substances like marijuana and meth. In the DSM, if multiple substances are involved, I could code each individually or use F19.*. For substance-induced psychotic disorder, specific codes apply based on the substances involved. For instance, cannabis uses F12.159 or F12.259. I wonder if there\u2019s an unspecified code like F19.959 for substance-induced psychotic disorder? I'm trying to clarify the exact codes used in DSM.\n\n**Reviewing substance use coding**\n\nI\u2019m checking the ICD-10 codes for substance-induced psychotic disorder, like F15.159 for stimulant abuse, but it might not fit. The ICD-10 categorizes substance use with F1x.1 for abuse, F1x.2 for dependence, and F1x.9 for unspecified use. In the DSM-5, \"substance use disorder\" aligns with mild, moderate, and severe levels. For instance, F10.10 indicates mild alcohol use disorder while F10.20 indicates moderate\/severe. Based on the user\u2019s past psychiatric history with substances, I might lean towards moderate\/severe but it could be tricky to choose the right code.\n\n**Deciding on stimulant use coding**\n\nI'm thinking about how to code stimulant use when severity isn't specified. I could use \"F15.20\" for \"Other stimulant dependence,\" but that might not be accurate. \"F15.10\" is for abuse, which aligns with mild use in DSM, but I\u2019m uncertain about severity. I might lean towards \"F15.90,\" which is for \"Other stimulant use, unspecified.\" The instructions allow for unspecified codes to reflect limited data, so this could work, especially given the user's past history of substance use disorder. It suggests a diagnosis might be appropriate, even if details are unclear.\n\n**Determining top diagnoses and codes**\n\nI need to identify the top 5 diagnoses, considering substance use disorder (SUD) as secondary. Alternatively, I could use \"Stimulant intoxication with psychotic features\" as the primary diagnosis. For methamphetamine intoxication, the code might be F15.929 for uncomplicated intoxication. However, since there are psychotic symptoms, I should look at codes for intoxication with perceptual disturbances or psychotic disorder\u2014possibly F15.122 for \"Other stimulant-induced psychotic disorder.\" \n\nIn DSM-5-TR, F15.959 represents \"Other stimulant-induced psychotic disorder, unspecified.\" I\u2019ll double-check for accuracy to ensure I\u2019m coding correctly.\n\n**Reviewing stimulant and substance coding**\n\nI'm considering using ICD-10 F-codes for the DSM-5 diagnoses without delving into induced psychotic disorders. For example, \"Stimulant-induced psychotic disorder\" could correspond to F15.959, while \"Psychotic disorder due to substance\" might match F19.950. The codes need to be valid ICD-10-CM codes, meaning they should typically have five or six digits. \n\nSince the patient has significant impairment due to ongoing use, I'll likely lean towards coding \"F15.20\" for Other Stimulant Dependence, which reflects the severity suggested by their history.\n\nThough I can infer some criteria for substance use disorder based on their situation, I have to be cautious about accurately determining the severity.\n\n**Analyzing substance-related disorders**\n\nThe patient tested positive for marijuana, meth, and PCP, using these substances for two days and presenting with agitation and psychosis. \"Stimulant intoxication\" and \"Phencyclidine intoxication\" are plausible, but since the symptoms were severe, labeling it as \"Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder\" might be more appropriate. \n\nI need to consider including both diagnoses along with \"Stimulant use disorder\" and \"Other psychoactive substance-induced psychotic disorder.\" His quick resolution of symptoms and history may call for differential diagnoses such as schizophrenia, while focusing mainly on the substance-induced conditions for accuracy.\n\n**Evaluating psychotic disorders**\n\nI'm considering the DSM-5-TR classification for the patient's condition. Using \"Other (or Unknown) Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder,\" I might lean toward using F19.959 for multiple substances. However, because of the significant history of meth use, I can also look at labeling it as \"Other Stimulant-Induced Psychotic Disorder\" (F15.959) as a primary diagnosis.\n\nPCP is often linked with severe agitation and delusions, so \"Phencyclidine-Induced Psychotic Disorder\" might be another strong candidate. The patient has positive UDS results for marijuana, meth, and PCP, suggesting recent substances without confirming active intoxication. I may select \"Substance\/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder (multiple substances)\" for accuracy. Other possibilities could include acute intoxication diagnoses. Given the evidence, the top five diagnoses might encapsulate both substance use and psychosis considerations.\n\n**Assessing substance use disorders**\n\nI'm thinking that the patient might have a \"Stimulant Use Disorder\" and possibly a \"Cannabis Use Disorder,\" maybe even severe. This situation limits my secondary diagnosis options, leading me to consider F15.20 for meth use and F12.20 for cannabis, along with potential F16.20 for PCP use. However, given their recent substance use and potential intoxication, I\u2019ll focus on what best reflects the acute cases, leaning towards prioritizing \"Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder\" related to meth and PCP while still addressing their past substance use disorders.\n\n**Finalizing diagnoses and codes**\n\nThe patient's past psychiatric history indicates a substance use disorder, including marijuana and meth. For PCP, while it may not be established, we can still consider it. The final list should include a primary diagnosis of \"Substance\/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder\" with the ICD code F19.959 for multiple substances. I\u2019ll include \"Stimulant Use Disorder\" (F15.20), \"Cannabis Use Disorder\" (F12.20), \"Phencyclidine Use Disorder\" (F16.20), and \"Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder\" (F29) as secondary diagnoses, focusing strictly on the most relevant and supported conditions.\n\n**Determining substance-induced psychotic disorder codes**\n\nI'm working on the ICD-10-CM codes for substance-induced psychotic disorder. For cannabis, there are specific codes, but we need to focus on the main ones for psychosis. The primary code could be F19.950, reflecting the presence of delusions. I'll list this diagnosis first. Then, other codes include stimulant use disorder (F15.20), cannabis use disorder (F12.20), phencyclidine use disorder (F16.20), and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum disorder (F29). This structured list ensures accuracy in my codes and captures the necessary details.\n\n**Clarifying substance-induced psychotic disorder codes**\n\nI'm working to develop the correct ICD-10 codes for substance-induced psychotic disorders. I think F19.950 might work for primary, as it indicates \"Other psychoactive substance use with delusions.\" However, I also see potential in using specific substance codes like F15.20 for stimulant use disorder and F12.20 for cannabis use disorder. To finalize, the likely diagnoses list might include:\n\n1. Substance\/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder - F19.950\n2. Stimulant (amphetamine-type) use disorder - F15.20\n3. Cannabis use disorder - F12.20\n4. Hallucinogen (PCP) use disorder - F16.20\n5. Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum disorder - F29\n\nThis list reflects the most likely diagnoses based on current information.\n\n**Finalizing diagnoses list**\n\nI\u2019m determining the ICD-10 codes for the main diagnoses based on the user's case. The primary diagnosis will likely be \"Substance\/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder\" coded as F19.950, with an understanding that it accounts for multiple substances. I\u2019ll also include:\n\n1. Substance\/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder - F19.950\n2. Stimulant (amphetamine-type) use disorder - F15.20\n3. Cannabis use disorder - F12.20\n4. Hallucinogen (phencyclidine\/PCP) use disorder - F16.20\n5. Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder - F29\n\nThis meets the criteria and provides a clear structured list!",

I need the top 5 DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses along with their ICD-10 F-codes, beginning with ODD (F91.3). I can consider secondary options like conduct disorder (F91.1, F91.2, F91.9) and ADHD (F90.2). I'll also think about Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (F34.81) and Intermittent Explosive Disorder (F63.81). Lastly, I should list plausible diagnoses without fabricating information.\n\n**Analyzing behavioral diagnoses**\n\nI'm assessing the boy's behavior, which shows signs of being argumentative, disrespectful, using profanities, and displaying defiance\u2014this points to Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD). Conduct disorder seems less likely since there aren't severe violations, though ADHD could be a comorbidity. Speculating about \u201cOther Specified Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder\u201d might lead to too much uncertainty. Instead, I\u2019ll consider including unspecified ADHD as a differential. I'll also evaluate ODD as the primary diagnosis while considering secondary options, like \u201cConduct Disorder, Unspecified Onset\u201d (F91.9).\n\n**Exploring possible diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m identifying potential diagnoses for the boy. First, I have Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), classified as F91.3. Attention-deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) with a combined presentation (F90.2) could also apply; while not explicitly described, ADHD is common alongside ODD and might contribute to school issues. Conduct Disorder is complicated here \u2014 I'm considering F91.1 or F91.9, but severe symptoms aren\u2019t present. I\u2019m also evaluating options like Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder and Intermittent Explosive Disorder, though neither fits perfectly given the context.\n\n**Evaluating diagnostic options**\n\nI\u2019m considering various possible diagnoses for the boy. An \"Other Specified Trauma and Stressor-Related Disorder\" doesn\u2019t seem right since he denies depression, so \"Unspecified Depressive Disorder\" and \"Unspecified Anxiety Disorder\" might not fit either. It\u2019s clearer to focus on disruptive disorders like ODD, Conduct Disorder, Intermittent Explosive Disorder, and Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (though DMDD is a mood disorder). For clarity, I think \u201cOther Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder\u201d (F91.8) could work, but I should also consider \"Unspecified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder\" (F91.9) as I compile a structured list.\n\n**Listing potential diagnoses**\n\nI need to compile a structured list of potential psychiatric diagnoses for the patient based on the given information. The primary diagnosis is likely Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD, F91.3) due to the defiant behavior in multiple settings. For the four secondary diagnoses, I will consider ADHD (F90.2 or F90.9) as a possible co-occurring condition, followed by Conduct Disorder (F91.9), Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (F34.81), and Adjustment Disorder with disturbance of conduct (F43.24). This allows for a comprehensive view while remaining within the guidelines of F-codes.\n\n**Evaluating potential diagnoses**\n\nI'm considering the possible diagnoses for the patient. Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD, F91.3) is likely primary due to the defiant behaviors observed. For four secondary diagnoses, I think about ADHD (F90.9) since there's some inattentiveness, followed by Conduct Disorder (F91.9), Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (F34.81), and Adjustment Disorder with Disturbance of Conduct (F43.24).

He had frequent thoughts of wanting to be dead and of suicide, but he denied any suicidal intent or plans.\n\nWhen asked about the alcohol, he acknowledged that he had been drinking heavily for at least 6 months. When asked about other substances, he asked about therapeutic confidentiality and then acknowledged that he had been using cocaine several times per week for about 9 months. He kept his cocaine use from his wife because he knew she would be judgmental. In the beginning, cocaine put him in a reliably positive, optimistic mood, and he found that he could more successfully churn through large volumes of otherwise tedious and discouraging work. Although his work required some socializing in the evening, he also began to regularly go to bars in the evening just so that he would have a place to comfortably combine cocaine with alcohol. He craved the high from cocaine, went out of his way to obtain it, and spent a lot of time getting high that he would previously have been spending with his family.\n\nWhen asked to clarify the sequence of work stress, cocaine use, and depression symptoms, he reported that he had felt worried and discouraged about work for a year, but the feelings of depression, loss of interest, irritability, insomnia, and low self-esteem had not begun until about 6 months earlier, 3 months after he had begun to use cocaine regularly. He experienced those depressive symptoms most of the day every day, whether or not he had taken cocaine within the last several days.\n\nMr. Young denied any previous episodes of depression, other mood or anxiety disorders, or suicide attempts. He drank socially. He had experimented with cannabis and cocaine as a teenager but had never developed a pattern of regular use or impairment until the past year.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Evaluating psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI need to follow instructions for diagnosing based on a vignette. I aim to list the top five DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses with their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes, following a structured format. This case is about a 40-year-old business executive showing signs of withdrawal, irritability, excessive drinking, and suicidal thoughts. I\u2019ll refine my focus to derive one primary diagnosis and four secondary diagnoses based on the details provided. This requires careful parsing of the case.\n\n**Analyzing substance use and depression**\n\nI'm looking at the case of someone who has been using cocaine several times a week for about nine months while keeping it from his wife. Initially, it boosted his mood and work performance, but he began combining it with alcohol and craving the high. His depressive symptoms emerged around the same time he started regular cocaine use. He\u2019s experiencing significant depression almost daily, leading me to suspect he may be in a major depressive episode.\n\n**Determining depressive disorder classification**\n\nHe definitely meets the criteria for a depressive disorder: he has a depressed mood most days, along with symptoms like anhedonia, insomnia, low energy, feelings of worthlessness, and irritability. It's been going on for six months, and he\u2019s experiencing significant functional impairment. No episodes of mania are noted, so it looks like Major Depressive Disorder is the right fit. Given his suicidal thoughts but no plan, I\u2019m considering F32.1 for moderate, even though there\u2019s a case for severe. I think moderate is more accurate for now.\n\n**Assessing depressive symptoms and diagnosis**\n\nI'm analyzing the case, considering symptoms like feeling down most of the time, difficulty sleeping, loss of interest in family, low energy, feelings of worthlessness, and suicidal thoughts. That gives me at least six symptoms, definitely aligning with the criteria for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). While work stress might be a factor, his symptoms exceed what would be expected for an adjustment disorder. Cocaine use came before the depression, which complicates things; I wonder if there\u2019s a possibility of a substance-induced depressive disorder here.\n\n**Evaluating substance use and depressive disorder**\n\nI'm analyzing the criteria for Substance\/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder. The symptoms emerged during cocaine use but have persisted even when he hasn't used for several days. Given his use of cocaine several times a week with heavy alcohol consumption, there's a likelihood he's experiencing either a cocaine-induced depression or primary Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). His symptoms seem continuous despite recent use, and he does not have prolonged abstinence to confirm independent MDD. Considering the timeline, I suspect both Cocaine Use Disorder and possible substance-induced depression.\n\n**Diagnosing substance and mood disorders**\n\nI'm determining diagnoses based on substance use and mood symptoms. He meets criteria for \"Cocaine Use Disorder, moderate\" due to frequent use and cravings. Alcohol use might also fit \"Alcohol Use Disorder, moderate,\" given heavy social drinking, possibly contributing to depression. His depressive symptoms could lead to \"Substance\/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder,\" but given the overlap with substances, I need to select the top five most relevant diagnoses. I might include both MDD and substance-induced depression as differentials. Let's finalize that list!\n\n**Structuring diagnoses for evaluation**\n\nI need to provide a structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses, focusing on the top five most likely. Given the case, I\u2019ll list \"Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, moderate\/severe\" and \"Cocaine Use Disorder, moderate\" as primary candidates. I could also include \"Alcohol Use Disorder\" and \"Substance\/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder\" as alternatives, depending on the relationship between symptoms and substance use. I think it\u2019s important to base this decision on the detailed history without contradicting diagnoses. Let\u2019s finalize this list!\n\n**Evaluating depression with substance use**\n\nThe patient's stress may have preceded his cocaine use for nine months, suggesting he started using it to cope with low mood. Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) could be primary, while substance-induced depression might also apply here. He experiences depressed mood consistently, irrespective of cocaine use, implying possible withdrawal states. However, his symptoms have persisted, complicating the diagnosis further. I need to choose between MDD and substance-induced depressive disorder as primary. Let's clarify the sequence of symptoms, as that\u2019s crucial for accurate diagnosis!\n\n**Determining psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI'm considering various potential diagnoses for this case. Along with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and substance use disorders, I\u2019m also thinking about cocaine-induced issues. I need to present a structured list of five diagnoses, focusing on ICD-10 F-codes. My top choices include MDD as moderate or severe given the symptoms and possible implications of substance use. I'll also list cocaine use disorder and alcohol use disorder as comorbid. Ultimately, I need to commit to the primary diagnosis while ensuring I cover all possibilities.\n\n**Reviewing substance-induced depression criteria**\n\nI\u2019m checking the DSM-5 criteria for substance\/medication-induced depressive disorder. To qualify, symptoms must arise during or shortly after substance use, which fits here, although it's ambiguous. His depression continues even when he doesn't use for several days, suggesting possible withdrawal. He also has significant work stress, making it tricky to determine if his depression is independent. Ultimately, I'll need to diagnose both MDD and substance-induced depression while focusing on the top five potential diagnoses, ensuring I use the correct ICD-10 F-codes.\n\n**Assessing depressive disorders**\n\nI\u2019m evaluating a potential diagnosis for this case. He continues using substances despite marital issues and evidence suggests significant alcohol use alongside cocaine use. Given his symptoms, it seems he could qualify for moderate cocaine dependence and mild alcohol use disorder. With his suicidal thoughts as symptoms rather than diagnoses, I consider other possibilities like adjustment disorder or unspecified depressive disorder but lean toward MDD as primary. I\u2019ll compile a list of five relevant diagnoses focusing on substance-related impact.\n\n**Finalizing psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m creating a structured list of psychiatric diagnoses based on the information provided. I need to ensure I follow DSM-5-TR criteria and use the correct F-codes. I\u2019m considering several options, including Major Depressive Disorder as primary and exploring Cocaine and Alcohol Use Disorders as secondaries. I have to balance the need to avoid duplicates while also ensuring clarity in the diagnoses. My final list will include MDD, Cocaine Use Disorder, Alcohol Use Disorder, and possibly a Substance-Induced Depressive Disorder.\n\n**Structuring psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI'm narrowing down the top five psychiatric diagnoses based on the user's case, ensuring I'm citing the appropriate codes. For my primary diagnosis, I\u2019m leaning towards Cocaine Use Disorder, moderate (F14.20) since it seems to drive the symptoms. I'm also considering Alcohol Use Disorder (F10.10) and Major Depressive Disorder (F32.1). I might include Substance\/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (cocaine-induced, F14.24) as well. I need to avoid duplicates while providing a structured answer that fits the criteria set!\n\n**Finalizing psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m piecing together a structured list of psychiatric diagnoses. With the user describing depression accompanied by suicidal ideation, I\u2019m leaning towards Major Depressive Disorder as my primary diagnosis since it\u2019s urgent. On top of that, I\u2019m including Cocaine Use Disorder and Alcohol Use Disorder since they contribute to the symptoms. I also need to consider adding Substance\/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder but am cautious about duplication. My final list will reflect the most likely diagnoses while sticking strictly to the user's criteria.\n\n**Determining the primary diagnosis**\n\nI'm evaluating the patient\u2019s situation and their symptoms, focusing on what's most pertinent. They exhibit depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation, which might push Major Depressive Disorder into the primary diagnosis position. However, I\u2019m also considering Cocaine Use Disorder as a key factor given its influence on their situation. I want my final list of five diagnoses to accurately reflect the most likely issues, balancing the need to avoid duplication while ensuring appropriate severity is noted. It's complex but I'm getting there!\n\n**Determining the top diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m putting together a structured list of diagnoses based on the patient\u2019s situation. I\u2019m considering Cocaine Use Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder, but I\u2019m leaning toward MDD being primary since it addresses the urgent symptoms, especially with suicidality. I also recognize the importance of including Alcohol Use Disorder, and I'm settling on coding it as mild. My final list needs to reflect all relevant conditions without contradictions. It\u2019s quite the balancing act, but I\u2019m aiming for accuracy and clarity!\n\n**Determining the diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m decoding the possible diagnoses for the situation. It looks like the patient meets criteria for moderate Major Depressive Disorder due to having six symptoms. I\u2019m listing five diagnoses, starting with MDD and followed by Cocaine Use Disorder, and then considering Alcohol Use Disorder alongside possible substance-induced disorders. I\u2019m also thinking of including an adjustment disorder, but its relevance feels lower. Ultimately, I need to make sure this list reflects the most pressing symptoms and conditions accurately!\n\n**Producing final diagnosis list**\n\nI need to create a structured list of 5 diagnoses with their corresponding codes, following the user's instructions. I'm focusing on ensuring no reasoning or additional text, just the list itself. \n\nHere\u2019s the final output I\u2019ve compiled:\n\n1. Major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate - F32.1  \n2. Cocaine use disorder, moderate - F14.20  \n3. Alcohol use disorder, mild - F10.10  \n4. Substance\/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (cocaine-induced) - F14.24  \n5. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood - F43.21  \n\nThis aligns with the requirements while keeping it straightforward.\n\n**Evaluating potential diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m considering a range of potential diagnoses here. The primary one could be Major Depressive Disorder (F32.1). Next, I'd look at Substance\/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder, such as cocaine-induced (F14.24) and alcohol-induced (F10.14 or F10.24). Also, Cocaine Use Disorder (F14.20) and Alcohol Use Disorder (F10.10) are relevant. Adjustment Disorder (F43.21) could fit in, along with considerations for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1). I need to sort through these to determine the five most likely diagnoses while ensuring consistent coding.\n\n**Finalizing the diagnosis list**\n\nIt seems like the main problem is substance use, possibly leading to secondary depression. Treatment should focus on addressing substance use. For the five diagnoses, I might list:\n\n1. Cocaine use disorder, moderate - F14.20  \n2. Major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate - F32.1  \n3. Alcohol use disorder, mild - F10.10  \n4. Substance\/Medication-induced depressive disorder (cocaine-induced) - F14.24  \n5. Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood - F43.23  \n\nThese reflect a balance between primary and secondary conditions.\n\n**Deciding on diagnoses**\n\nI'm grappling with whether to prioritize Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or Cocaine Use Disorder as primary. Considering the symptoms, it's rational to select MDD since he\u2019s depressed and suicidal. However, since his use of substances is a significant concern, I have to account for that too. \n\nSo, I\u2019m finalizing the diagnoses as follows:  \n1. Major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate - F32.1  \n2. Cocaine use disorder, moderate - F14.20  \n3. Alcohol use disorder, mild - F10.10  \n4. Cocaine-induced depressive disorder - F14.24  \n5. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood - F43.21\n\n**Evaluating adjustment and alcohol-induced disorders**\n\nI'm assessing if adjustment disorder is redundant since MDD is already included, but it could still explain some symptoms. Heavy alcohol use started several months ago, and depressive symptoms align closely with it. Diagnosing \"Alcohol-induced depressive disorder\" seems plausible as it can arise during intoxication or withdrawal. However, having both cocaine-induced and alcohol-induced depression might be cluttered. \n\nSo, for my top 5 diagnoses, I think I'll prefer:  \n1. Major depressive disorder - F32.1  \n2. Cocaine use disorder - F14.20  \n3. Alcohol use disorder, mild - F10.10  \n4. Cocaine-induced depressive disorder - F14.24  \n5. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood - F43.21\n\n**Assessing diagnoses**\n\nThe patient has experienced work stress over the past year, but major depressive symptoms arose six months ago, not directly related to the initial stress. This might make adjustment disorder less likely. Alcohol-induced depression seems more plausible since symptoms started around the same time heavy alcohol use began. \n\nFor my top five diagnoses, I'll include:\n1. Major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate - F32.1\n2. Cocaine use disorder, moderate - F14.20\n3. Alcohol use disorder, mild - F10.10\n4. Substance\/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (cocaine-induced) - F14.24\n5. Alcohol-induced depressive disorder - F10.14. \n\nThis approach covers different aspects of the patient's condition.\n\n**Finalizing diagnostic list**\n\nI\u2019ve settled on the primary diagnosis of \"Major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate\" coded F32.1 since it clearly meets the criteria. For cocaine and alcohol use disorders, I\u2019ll code \"Cocaine use disorder, moderate\" as F14.20 and \"Alcohol use disorder, mild\" as F10.10. I\u2019ll include \"Substance\/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (cocaine-induced)\" coded F14.24 and \"Substance\/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (alcohol-induced)\" as F10.14. With this structure, I ensure a comprehensive overview of the patient's situation.",

    "vignette":"Sebastian Lopez, a 27-year-old Hispanic freelance editor, was brought to his long-time HIV clinic by his worried partner. As the patient entered the clinic waiting room, he announced, \u201cGod has cured me! I can stop my antivirals!\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. Lopez fidgeted on a chair, furiously writing on a yellow pad, his partner provided the recent history. He said that the patient had been doing well until approximately 1 month earlier. At that point, he began an unusually intense editing project. After about 10 days of little sleep, \u201cboundless energy,\u201d and activity, Mr. Lopez seemed edgy, a little pressured, and \u201cglassy-eyed.\u201d That night, the two of them went to a party to celebrate the completion of the work project. Despite several years of Narcotics Anonymous meetings and abstinence from illicit substances, Mr. Lopez took crystal methamphetamine, a stimulant. Acutely anxious and paranoid that they were being followed, Mr. Lopez drank three martinis but still did not sleep that night. Over the ensuing days the patient became less paranoid, but he appeared increasingly distracted and his speech was more pressured.\n\nMr. Lopez\u2019s work project was returned with multiple negative comments and requests for corrections. Instead of focusing on his editing, however, he stayed up late every night, intent on finding a cure for HIV. He made inappropriate, hypersexual advances toward other men at the gym, where he spent much of the day. He lost at least 5 pounds after deciding he should take vitamin supplements instead of food and his antiretroviral medication. He refused to go to the emergency room but finally agreed to come to his routine AIDS clinic appointment to show his doctors how well he had done despite not having taken his medications in over a month.\n\nMr. Lopez\u2019s psychiatric history was without a prior episode of clear-cut mania, but he had been depressed as a teenager during the early phase of his coming-out process. That episode was punctuated by a purposeful overdose and a 2-week psychiatric hospitalization and treatment with antidepressant medication and psychotherapy. Mr. Lopez had discontinued the medication because it made him \u201chyper and edgy,\u201d and he stopped the psychotherapy because \u201cit was pointless.\u201d He used methamphetamine frequently for several years, which led to recurrent unprotected intercourse with strangers.\n\nMr. Lopez was diagnosed with HIV at age 22, at which point he went to an outpatient substance use disorder rehabilitation center and discontinued his use of stimulants and alcohol. His lowest CD4 lymphocyte count had been 216 cells\/mm3, when he was age 24, at which time his viral load was 1.6 million copies. He had been reportedly adherent to his antiretroviral medications since then. His most recent CD4 count, 6 months prior to this episode, had been 526 cells\/mm3. His viral load had been undetectable. He had suffered fatigue but had not had any AIDS-defining illnesses. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain revealed mild cortical atrophy and periventricular white matter disease in excess of what would be expected for his age. The partner was unsure when Mr. Lopez had discontinued his antiretrovirals but thought it might have been months earlier. He also wondered if Mr. Lopez had \u201clost a step\u201d cognitively over the past year.\n\nHis family psychiatric history was significant for a maternal aunt who had received lithium and several courses of electroconvulsive therapy, but her diagnosis was unknown.\n\nOn examination, the patient was a sloppily dressed young man who told a pressured, disjointed story of events over the prior month. He was difficult to direct and was uncharacteristically irritable and devaluing. He was preoccupied with having discovered a cure for HIV through multivitamins and exercise. He denied hallucinations and suicidal and homicidal ideation. He refused cognitive testing, and his insight and judgment appeared poor.",
