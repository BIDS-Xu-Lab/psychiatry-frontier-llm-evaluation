    "vignette":"Terry Najarian, a 65-year-old salesman for a large corporation, presented for a psychiatric evaluation after his wife threatened to leave him. Although he said he was embarrassed to discuss his issues with a stranger, he described his sexual interest in women\u2019s undergarments in a quite matter-of-fact manner. This interest had surfaced several years earlier and had not been a problem until he was caught masturbating by his wife 6 weeks prior to the evaluation. Upon seeing him dressed in panties and a bra, she initially \u201cwent nuts,\u201d thinking he was having an affair. After he clarified that he was not seeing anyone else, she \u201cshut him out\u201d and hardly spoke to him. When they argued, she called him a \u201cpervert\u201d and made it clear that she was considering divorce unless he \u201cgot help.\u201d\n\nMr. Najarian\u2019s habit began in the setting of his wife\u2019s severe arthritis and likely depression, both of which significantly reduced her overall activity level and specifically her interest in sex. His \u201cfetish\u201d was the bright spot during his frequent and otherwise dreary business trips. He also masturbated at home but generally waited until his wife was out of the house. His specific pattern was to masturbate about twice weekly, using bras and panties that he had collected over several years. He said that intercourse with his wife had faded to \u201cevery month or two\u201d but was mutually satisfying.\n\nThe patient had been married for over 30 years, and the couple had two grown children. Mr. Najarian had planned to retire comfortably later that year, but not if the two choices were either \u201cto be poor after we split the assets or to sit around the house all day and be called a pervert.\u201d\n\nHe became visibly anxious when discussing his marital difficulties. He described some recent difficulty falling asleep and \u201cworried constantly\u201d about his marriage but denied other psychiatric problems. He had made a show of throwing away a half dozen pieces of underwear, which had seemed to reassure his wife, but he had saved his \u201cfavorites\u201d and \u201ccould always buy more.\u201d He said he was of mixed mind. He did not want to end his marriage, but he saw nothing harmful in his new mode of masturbating. \u201cI\u2019m not unfaithful or doing anything bad,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just excites me, and my wife certainly doesn\u2019t want to be having sex a few times a week.\u201d\n\nMr. Najarian denied any difficulties related to sexual functioning, adding that he could maintain erections and achieve orgasm without women\u2019s undergarments. He recalled being aroused when he touched women\u2019s underwear as a teenager and had masturbated repeatedly to that experience. That fantasy had disappeared when he became sexually active with his wife. He denied any personal or family history of mental illness.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the clinical vignette about Terry Najarian. The patient is a 65-year-old salesman brought in by marital issues after his wife discovered his sexual interest in women's undergarments. He's been engaging in this behavior for several years, but it only became a problem when his wife caught him recently. \n\nFirst, I need to extract key details. His primary issue revolves around a specific fetish\u2014using bras and panties for masturbation, which he finds arousing. He's been doing this since adolescence, but it resurfaced due to his wife's decreased sexual interest from arthritis and depression. He masturbates about twice a week, collects the underwear, and hides it from his wife. He's anxious about the marital conflict, has trouble sleeping, and worries constantly, but denies other psychiatric symptoms. No personal or family history of mental illness.\n\nNow, organizing this data. The core symptoms: recurrent, intense sexual arousal from nonliving objects (women's underwear) for over six months, causing distress and marital conflict. That fits a paraphilic disorder. But here's the nuance: he doesn't see his behavior as harmful, but the marital distress is significant. The DSM-5-TR requires distress or impairment, which is present here due to the threat of divorce and his anxiety about it.\n\nNext, differential diagnosis. The primary is likely Fetishistic Disorder, given the focus on non-genital body parts or nonliving objects. But I need to consider other paraphilias. Transvestic Disorder involves cross-dressing for arousal, but he's not dressing as a woman\u2014just using underwear. Also, he denies any gender dysphoria. Sexual Dysfunction isn't indicated since he has no issues with erections or orgasm. Maybe Voyeuristic or Exhibitionistic Disorders, but there's no mention of involving non-consenting others. \n\nThen, the anxiety and sleep issues\u2014are they secondary to the marital stress or a separate disorder? He's worried constantly, has insomnia, but it's situational. So Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety could be a secondary diagnosis. He might also have Unspecified Anxiety Disorder, but the distress seems directly linked to the marital conflict. \n\nWhat about the wife's depression? Not directly relevant to his diagnosis, but his behavior emerged in response to her decreased libido, which might indicate a relational issue. However, the main problem is his paraphilic interest causing interpersonal conflict. \n\nAlso, rule out other conditions. No substance use mentioned, no psychotic features, no mood disorders beyond situational anxiety. His functioning is otherwise intact\u2014job, marriage until recently. So, Fetishistic Disorder as primary, then Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety due to the marital crisis. Maybe Other Specified Sexual Disorder if the fetish doesn't fully meet criteria, but it seems it does. \n\nWait, does he meet all criteria for Fetishistic Disorder? Criterion A: sexual arousal from nonliving objects (underwear) for over 6 months. Criterion B: the urges or behaviors cause clinically significant distress (marital conflict, threat of divorce, his anxiety). Criterion C: not better explained by another condition. Yes, that fits. \n\nSecondary diagnoses: Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety (F43.22), Other Specified Sexual Disorder (F65.89) if there's any nuance, but likely not needed. Perhaps Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9) if the anxiety is more generalized, but it seems situational. Also, consider Relational Problems (Z codes), but those aren't F-codes, so skip. \n\nSo, top five: Fetishistic Disorder primary, then Adjustment Disorder, Other Specified Sexual Disorder, Unspecified Anxiety Disorder, and maybe No Diagnosis if none apply, but that's not an F-code. Hmm, need four secondaries. Let's list: 1. Fetishistic Disorder, 2. Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety, 3. Other Specified Sexual Disorder (if fetish is subthreshold), 4. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder, 5. Maybe Other Specified Paraphilic Disorder? But that's similar. \n\nActually, the vignette doesn't suggest other paraphilias, so stick with the main ones. Ensure ICD-10 codes are accurate: F65.0 for Fetishistic Disorder, F43.22 for Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety, F65.89 for Other Specified Sexual Disorder, F41.9 for Unspecified Anxiety Disorder, and perhaps F65.9 for Unspecified Paraphilic Disorder as a less likely alternative. \n\nWait, he denied personal or family history of mental illness, but current symptoms are present. So, primary is F65.0, secondary F43.22, then others as possibilities. Let me double-check the DSM-5-TR criteria for each to ensure accuracy.",

    "vignette":"A 27-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of convulsions.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 2 years before this admission, when shaking of the trunk, arms, and legs occurred. The episode lasted approximately 4 to 5 minutes and had been preceded by a sharp pain in the back of the head that radiated to the neck, blurred vision, palpitations, nausea, and difficulty concentrating. The patient did not seek evaluation, and no additional convulsive episodes occurred during the subsequent 20 months.\nFour months before this admission, while the patient was drinking alcohol at a party, his body suddenly became stiff, and he fell backward onto a table. Shaking of the trunk, arms, and legs occurred for approximately 5 to 8 minutes. He had urinary incontinence but did not bite his tongue. Five minutes later, similar convulsions occurred. The patient was taken to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. The results of computed tomography of the head were normal, as was an electroencephalogram (EEG) that was obtained over a period of 40 minutes. Treatment with levetiracetam was started. The patient was discharged home with a recommendation for follow-up evaluation at the neurology clinic of the other hospital.\nThree months before this admission, the patient was evaluated at the neurology clinic of the other hospital. He reported that despite the use of levetiracetam, convulsions occurred approximately once per week. The results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, were reportedly normal. Treatment with lamotrigine was started. There was no change in the quality or frequency of the convulsive episodes.\nOne month before this admission, while the patient was at work, his colleagues found him on the floor, and they witnessed \u201cshaking and clenching\u201d movements of the trunk, arms, and legs that lasted approximately 2 minutes. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was taken to the emergency department of a second hospital for evaluation.\nAt least two additional convulsive episodes occurred at the second hospital. During one episode, the shaking movements became less intense when the physician\u2019s hand was placed on the patient\u2019s shoulder; the movements resumed at the previous intensity when the hand was removed. In addition, the patient\u2019s eyes were closed. When the eyelids were opened manually, no nystagmus or gaze deviation was present. When the eyelids were released, the eyes shut forcefully and Bell\u2019s phenomenon (upward deviation of the eyes when closing) occurred. The patient did not speak but was able to follow simple verbal commands, such as an instruction to squeeze the physician\u2019s hands. In between the convulsive episodes, there were intermittent rocking movements of the upper body and nonrhythmic tremulous movements of the hands, and the patient did not speak or follow commands. After several hours, the episodes stopped, and the patient was able to speak. Admission to the hospital was recommended; however, the patient declined because of work obligations and anxiety about being in the hospital. He was discharged home.\nDuring the subsequent month, the patient continued to take levetiracetam and lamotrigine. However, the convulsions increased in frequency to one to three times per week.\nOn the morning before the current admission, while the patient was at work, his colleagues noticed that he abruptly stopped speaking and began to have shaking movements of the arms and legs. Emergency medical services were called. On their arrival, the patient\u2019s body was stiff, and there was twitching of the trunk, arms, and legs. No urinary or fecal incontinence or biting of the tongue had occurred. The patient was able to stand up from a chair and walk to the ambulance. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 111\/56 mm Hg, the pulse 83 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was awake and alert but did not speak. His eyes were open, with a primary midline gaze and blinking in response to visual threat. His body appeared stiff, with the arms and legs straightened. There were intermittent nonrhythmic tremulous movements of the trunk, arms, and legs. The patient was able to follow complex commands and to move the arms and legs symmetrically and against gravity, but there was a delay in motor activation. The deep-tendon reflexes were normal. Extensive scarring from burns was present on the face, trunk, back, arms, and legs.\nApproximately 45 minutes after the tremulous movements had stopped, the patient was able to speak but with limited fluency. Additional history was obtained. He had been taking levetiracetam and lamotrigine as directed; however, 3 days before this evaluation, he had stopped taking these medications because he was unsure whether they were effective. That morning, he had felt well until he noticed a sharp pain in the back of his head that radiated to his neck, along with sudden blurred vision, full-body numbness, and difficulty concentrating. A convulsive episode then occurred that lasted up to 20 minutes; during the episode, the patient was aware of events but sometimes had difficulty hearing. He described his overall mood as \u201cpretty good\u201d and did not report decreased energy or chronic fatigue. There was no history of psychotic or manic symptoms, suicidal ideation, or obsessive or compulsive behaviors.\nThe patient had a history of a febrile seizure in childhood, as well as several concussions that had occurred while he was playing sports in childhood. He reported that during the first 6 years of life, his social supports were limited, and he had experienced maltreatment by a family member; he did not elaborate on the nature of the maltreatment. In late childhood, he was involved in a house fire and hospitalized for a prolonged period because of severe burns on the face, body, arms, and legs. He had asthma, major depressive disorder, chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and panic disorder with agoraphobia. He took escitalopram daily and lorazepam as needed for panic attacks. He was in a long-term romantic relationship. He did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs; he smoked marijuana approximately once per year and drank one alcoholic beverage per week. His father had died of heart disease when the patient was a teenager; his mother had schizoaffective disorder and post-traumatic epilepsy.\nBlood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The blood lactate level was 2.4 mmol per liter (22 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.2 mmol per liter [5 to 20 mg per deciliter]) and the blood creatine kinase level 489 U per liter (reference range, 60 to 400). Serum and urine toxicologic panels were negative. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was admitted to this hospital.",

    "model_thoughts":"Hmm, this is a complex clinical vignette requiring careful analysis. The patient presents with convulsive episodes but there are several atypical features suggesting a functional neurological disorder rather than epilepsy. \n\nThe key observations include: convulsions increasing under stress, preserved awareness during episodes, atypical movements like nonrhythmic tremors, and the physical exam finding where shaking decreased when touched. Normal EEG and MRI results despite frequent episodes are also significant. \n\nThe patient's psychiatric history of depression, PTSD, and panic disorder, along with childhood trauma and burns, provides important context. The family history of maternal schizoaffective disorder is noted but doesn't directly align with current symptoms.\n\nThe primary consideration must be functional neurological symptom disorder given the mismatch between symptoms and neurological findings. PTSD and panic disorder are clearly documented pre-existing conditions. Adjustment disorder and somatic symptom disorder should be considered given the psychological distress around symptoms. While depressive disorder is mentioned, the vignette states mood is \"pretty good\" currently.\n\nThe response format requires listing only diagnoses with F-codes, so clinical reasoning won't be included in the final output.",

    "vignette":"Only upon the repeated and fervent insistence of her parents did 19-year-old Emily reluctantly agree to see a psychiatrist. \u201cIt\u2019s not me you want to see,\u201d Emily proclaimed emphatically. \u201cIt\u2019s my insane parents who need your help.\u201d Emily did not offer a chief complaint, aside from the concern that her parents were driving her \u201ccrazy.\u201d She added, \u201cEverything is going great in my life. I have plenty of friends, go out almost every night, and always have lots of fun.\u201d\n\nWhile Emily was taking some time away from \u201cthe so-called real world,\u201d her sister was attending Duke University, her younger brother was excelling at a competitive private high school, and both her parents seemed to enjoy their careers as radiologists. She asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s enough strivers for one family?\u201d\n\nEmily agreed to have her parents join the session, and they told a different story. They tearfully disclosed that their daughter had become irritable, unproductive, and oppositional. She drank to intoxication almost every night, often not returning home for an entire weekend. In searching her room, they had found small amounts of marijuana, alprazolam (Xanax), cocaine, and prescription stimulants. The parents described the changes in Emily\u2019s personality as \u201can adolescent nightmare\u201d and described her friends as \u201closers who do nothing but dye their hair, get tattoos, and hate everything.\u201d Emily\u2019s attitudes and behavior contrasted markedly with those of her parents and siblings. \u201cWe don\u2019t mind that she is doing her own thing and that she isn\u2019t conservative like the rest of us,\u201d her father said, \u201cbut it\u2019s like we don\u2019t even recognize who she\u2019s become.\u201d\n\nAccording to her parents, Emily\u2019s \u201cadolescent nightmare\u201d began 4 years earlier. She had apparently been a studious 15-year-old girl with a lively sense of humor and a wide circle of \u201cterrific friends.\u201d \u201cAlmost overnight,\u201d she began to shun her longtime friends in favor of \u201cdropouts and malcontents\u201d and began to accumulate traffic tickets and school detentions. Instead of her former bright-eyed curiosity, Emily manifested a lack of interest in all her academic subjects, and her grades dropped from As to Ds. The parents were at an absolute loss to explain the sudden and dramatic change.\n\nThe abrupt change in performance led the psychiatrist to ask Emily to take a battery of neuropsychological tests so the results could be compared with those of tests that she had taken when she had applied to a private high school several years earlier. In particular, Emily retook two high school admissions tests: the System for Assessment and Group Evaluation (SAGE), which measures a broad array of academic and perceptual aptitudes, and the Differential Aptitude Tests (DAT), which focus on reasoning, spelling, and perceptual skills.\n\nOn the SAGE, her average percentile scores dropped from the upper 10% for a 13-year-old to the bottom 10% for an adult (and the bottom 20% for a 13-year-old). When Emily took the DAT at age 13, she scored in the highest range for ninth graders across almost all measures. Her worst result had been in spelling, where she scored at the second-highest level. Upon repeating the test at age 19, she scored below the high school average in all measures.\n\nEEG, brain CT, and T2-weighted brain MRI scans showed no evidence of structural brain damage. However, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) T2-weighted MRI displayed a clear lesion in the left frontal cortex, highly suggestive of previous injury to that region.\n\nUpon further questioning about the crucial period in which she seemed to have changed, Emily admitted to being in a traffic accident with her now ex-boyfriend, Mark. Although Emily did not recall much from this episode, she remembered that she hit her head and that she had bad headaches for many weeks thereafter. Because Emily was not bleeding and there was no damage to the car, neither Mark nor Emily reported the incident to anyone. With Emily\u2019s permission, the psychiatrist contacted Mark, who was away at college but a willing and excellent historian. He remembered the incident well. \u201cEmily hit her head very, very hard on the dashboard of my car. She was not totally unconscious but very dazed. For about 3 hours, she spoke very slowly, complained that her head hurt badly, and was confused. For about 2 hours she didn\u2019t know where she was or what day it was. She also threw up twice. I was really scared, but Emily didn\u2019t want me to worry her parents since they\u2019re so overprotective. And then she broke up with me, and we\u2019ve hardly spoken since.\u201d",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, the user wants me to act as an expert psychiatrist and diagnose this case based on DSM-5-TR criteria. I need to follow the rubric provided, aiming for Level 5 in both data extraction and diagnostic reasoning. But the user explicitly said not to output any clinical reasoning in the final answer\u2014just the structured list of diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes. So I'll keep the reasoning internal here.\n\nFirst, I'll extract all key clinical details. Emily is 19, brought by parents due to personality changes starting around age 15. She denies problems, but parents report irritability, oppositional behavior, substance use (alcohol, marijuana, alprazolam, cocaine, stimulants), decline in academic performance, and social changes. There's a history of head injury from a car accident around the time symptoms began, with post-traumatic amnesia and vomiting. Neuropsychological testing shows significant decline from previous high functioning. MRI shows a left frontal cortex lesion. No structural damage on CT or standard MRI, but FLAIR suggests prior injury.\n\nNow, organizing this: The core issue is a dramatic personality change post-head injury with cognitive decline, substance use, and behavioral issues. The frontal lobe lesion is key. I need to consider disorders due to another medical condition, substance-related disorders, and other differentials.\n\nFor diagnostic reasoning: The primary diagnosis should account for the personality change, cognitive decline, and frontal lobe lesion. Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Traumatic Brain Injury fits best. Next, Substance Use Disorders are evident from the polysubstance use. Oppositional Defiant Disorder might explain some behavioral issues, but it's less likely given the onset post-injury. Personality Change Due to Another Medical Condition could be considered, but the cognitive decline points more toward Neurocognitive Disorder. Adjustment Disorder is possible given the family dynamics, but the structural brain finding takes precedence.\n\nI'll prioritize based on impact and evidence: The TBI and its consequences are the most salient. Substance use is significant but may be secondary to the behavioral changes from the brain injury. Other diagnoses like ODD or Adjustment Disorder are less supported given the medical findings.\n\nFinally, the list should be in order of likelihood: Neurocognitive Disorder Due to TBI, then Substance Use Disorders, then other behavioral diagnoses.

The couple agreed that Mr. Sandahl had become \u201calmost impossible to live with.\u201d Mrs. Sandahl reported that although she had always considered her husband \u201chigh-strung,\u201d his outbursts were increasing in both frequency and intensity, and she worried that he would become violent with her.\n\nTheir most recent argument began when Mr. Sandahl came home after a \u201chard day at work\u201d to find that dinner was not ready. When he entered the kitchen and saw his wife sitting at the table reading the newspaper, he \u201cexploded\u201d and launched into a tirade about how \u201cbad\u201d a wife she was. When Mrs. Sandahl tried to explain her own long day, Mr. Sandahl cursed at her and broke glassware and a kitchen chair. Terrified, she ran out of the kitchen, gathered up the toddlers, and left for her mother\u2019s house a few miles away. The next day, she told her husband that he would need to get help immediately or prepare for a divorce.\n\nMr. Sandahl said his \u201cblowups\u201d began in childhood but did not become \u201cproblematic\u201d for him until age 13. At about that time, he started having frequent fights with classmates that would occasionally result in trips to the principal\u2019s office. In between the altercations, he was active socially and a solid student.\n\nMr. Sandahl estimated that he had had approximately four verbal outbursts a week in recent years, generally in response to frustration, unexpected demands, or perceived insults. In addition to these heated verbal tussles, Mr. Sandahl described acts of violence about every 2 months; for example, he threw a computer monitor across the room when it started \u201cacting up,\u201d he kicked a hole in a wall when one of his children would not quit crying, and he destroyed his mobile phone during an argument with his mother. He denied physical fights since his adolescence, although he had nearly come to blows with a neighbor as well as an assortment of strangers and employees. The idea that he might physically hurt someone scared Mr. Sandahl \u201cto the core.\u201d\n\nThese outbursts blighted his relationships with colleagues and romantic partners and led to his decision to start his own landscaping company at age 25. The business had done well, despite his demanding style and \u201chair-trigger\u201d temper that led to high employee turnover.\n\nMr. Sandahl described the episodes as short-lived, reaching a peak within seconds and rarely lasting more than a few minutes. Between episodes, he described himself as feeling \u201cfine.\u201d He had experienced brief periods of depressed mood and increased anxiety, but these had not impaired him significantly and tended to resolve on their own within a week. Mr. Sandahl drank socially, but neither he nor his wife linked the outbursts to the alcohol. He had a history of experimentation with various drugs of abuse, but not in recent years.\n\nMr. Sandahl reported at least two other immediate family members with significant \u201canger issues.\u201d His father was emotionally abusive and perfectionistic, expecting \u201cgreat things\u201d from his only son. Mr. Sandahl\u2019s older sister also had problems with her temper; he attributed her three divorces to her emotionally abusive behavior.\n\nOn examination, Mr. Sandahl was casually dressed, cooperative, and coherent.

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the clinical vignette about Lucas Sandahl. He's a 32-year-old landscape architect presenting with anger issues. His wife is concerned about his outbursts, which have been increasing in frequency and intensity. The recent incident involved him breaking things when dinner wasn't ready. \n\nFirst, I need to extract all relevant information. His anger episodes started in childhood but became problematic at age 13 with fights in school. He has about four verbal outbursts weekly and acts of violence every two months, like throwing objects or damaging property. The episodes are short-lived, peaking within seconds and lasting only a few minutes. Between episodes, he feels fine. He mentions brief periods of depressed mood and anxiety but they resolve on their own. There's no substance abuse currently linked to the outbursts. Family history includes father and sister with anger issues. Mental status exam shows he's cooperative, coherent, contrite, denies depression, psychosis, or homicidal\/suicidal thoughts, with good insight and judgment during the interview.\n\nNow, organizing this data. The core symptom is recurrent behavioral outbursts representing a failure to control aggressive impulses, as evidenced by verbal aggression and property destruction. The outbursts are disproportionate to the provocation, occur impulsively, and cause distress or impairment in relationships and work. He's not premeditatedly aggressive, and between episodes he's not irritable or angry. That points towards Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED). The age of onset is early adolescence, which aligns with IED. The outbursts aren't better explained by another mental disorder, substance use, or medical condition. He has no psychosis, mood episodes are brief and not impairing, so not a mood disorder. No PTSD symptoms mentioned. No antisocial personality features as he shows remorse and concern. \n\nDifferential diagnosis: \n1. Intermittent Explosive Disorder - primary because the outbursts are impulsive, aggressive, disproportionate, and recurrent without other underlying disorders.\n2. Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder - if the symptoms don't fully meet IED criteria, but they seem to.\n3. Unspecified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder - less specific alternative.\n4. Adjustment Disorder with Disturbance of Conduct - but the pattern is chronic since adolescence, not in response to a recent stressor.\n5. Borderline Personality Disorder - possible due to anger and impulsivity, but lacks other BPD criteria like fear of abandonment, identity disturbance, self-harm, etc.\n6. Bipolar Disorder - but mood episodes are brief and not impairing, no manic symptoms mentioned.\n7. Oppositional Defiant Disorder - but that's usually diagnosed in children\/adolescents, and he's an adult now.\n8. Antisocial Personality Disorder - no evidence of deceitfulness, law-breaking, lack of remorse.\n9. ADHD - could have impulsivity, but no mention of attention issues or hyperactivity.\n10. Substance\/Medication-Induced - he drinks socially but not linked to outbursts, no recent drug use.\n\nTop 5 most likely:\n1. Intermittent Explosive Disorder - F63.81\n2. Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder - F91.8 (if IED criteria not fully met)\n3. Unspecified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder - F91.9\n4. Borderline Personality Disorder - F60.3 (considering impulsivity and anger)\n5. Adjustment Disorder with Disturbance of Conduct - F43.24 (but less likely given chronicity)\n\nWait, need to check if he meets full IED criteria. According to DSM-5-TR, IED requires recurrent behavioral outbursts representing failure to control aggressive impulses, manifested as verbal or physical aggression toward property, animals, or others, occurring twice weekly for three months or three episodes involving damage\/injury within a year. He has four verbal outbursts weekly and acts of violence every two months (which might be less frequent but still causing damage). The outbursts are impulsive, not premeditated, cause distress\/impairment, not better explained by another disorder. He's over 6, onset before 40, so yes, likely IED.\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder is a consideration due to impulsivity and anger, but he lacks other core features like unstable relationships, identity disturbance, recurrent suicidality, etc. He's contrite and has good insight, which might not align with BPD's typical pattern.\n\nAdjustment Disorder is less likely because the pattern is chronic since adolescence, not a reaction to a recent stressor.\n\nMaybe also consider Unspecified Impulse-Control Disorder if IED isn't the best fit.\n\nBut based on the vignette, IED seems the most appropriate primary diagnosis. Others are secondary possibilities.\n\nLet me list the top 5 with ICD-10 codes:\n1. Intermittent Explosive Disorder - F63.81\n2. Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder - F91.8\n3. Unspecified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder - F91.9\n4. Borderline Personality Disorder - F60.3\n5.

    "vignette":"J is a mid-20s military service member living independently in the community with a partner. J has a history of multiple ACEs (ACE scale score of 10\/10), with caregivers that were both physically and emotionally abusive when J's needs were voiced, resulting in a belief that it was unacceptable, unsafe, and futile to resolve interpersonal problems with caregivers, thus creating a sense of powerlessness and helplessness. Child and family services were never involved, and no legal charges were ever laid against the family for the abuse that J endured. J struggled with containing anger since early childhood resulting in physical and verbal aggression towards peers and teachers at school and family members at home. Caregivers attempted to contain J's aggressive behavior through forced administration of psychiatric medication. While growing up, J feared others and preferred to be alone, despite longing for family and friends. Socialization with peers proved difficult, as J was easily overwhelmed by noise associated with social contact and was frequently ridiculed or misunderstood while trying to verbally communicate.\n\nAs a young adult, J left family to enter the military, which became an immediate source of attachment and social belonging. More recently, J became increasingly unable to cope with anger following an ill-suited work position and a musculoskeletal injury, resulting in frequent angry verbal altercations and threats of violence towards military peers who placed restrictions on his activities. This led to disciplinary action and isolation from the unit, which further increased anger, hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts and led to a psychiatric military assessment. During the assessment, J disclosed feelings of intense anger which eventually manifested in an attack on a family member in an amnestic dissociated state. J's history indicated that pharmacological treatments had either been ineffective or caused significant side effects. The military psychiatrist determined J ought to be considered for military discharge. This triggered flashbacks of past childhood abuse and a significant increase in rage. J refused trials of psychiatric medications in the community due to a childhood history of forced medication administration. Due to significant safety concerns and limited ability to control aggressive behavior in the community, J's military psychiatrist referred J for an inpatient admission.\n\nOn initial assessment for admission, J appeared distrustful, angry, and concerned about acting out on anger and expressed suicidal ideation. On mental status examination, J was tall and appeared neatly dressed in a military uniform. J appeared hypervigilant and intensely watchful and was well spoken, using a \u201csharp\u201d tone of voice. J provided a detailed history, demonstrating a goal-directed thought form and a high level of abstract thinking, logical analysis, and good recall. There were no delusions or hallucinations, but J endorsed prominent active suicidal ideation, with intent to act upon these thoughts if not hospitalized; however, there were no immediate, specific suicide plans.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the clinical case vignette. The patient is Ben, a 12-month-old infant. The key points from the father's report include distinct physical features like widely spaced eyes, low-set ears, a cat-like cry, and a history of low birth weight, NICU stay for a heart issue described as \"the wrong shape,\" feeding problems requiring a gastroenterologist, and recent genetic testing. On exam, the pediatrician notes diffuse hypotonia, excessive drooling, microcephaly, micrognathia, and a fixed split second heart sound.\n\nHmm, the combination of these features strongly suggests a genetic syndrome. The cat-like cry is a hallmark of Cri-du-chat syndrome, which is caused by a deletion on chromosome 5. That would explain the distinctive cry, microcephaly, hypotonia, and congenital heart defect. The father mentioned the heart being \"the wrong shape,\" which could refer to a structural defect like a ventricular septal defect or tetralogy of Fallot, both common in Cri-du-chat.\n\nWait, but there are other genetic disorders with overlapping features. Down syndrome often includes hypotonia, distinct facial features (though eyes are typically slanted, not widely spaced), and heart defects. However, the cat-like cry isn't typical for Down syndrome. Williams syndrome also has heart issues and distinctive facial features but usually includes a stellate pattern in the iris and elfin faces, not mentioned here. Angelman syndrome presents with developmental delay, hypotonia, and microcephaly, but the laughter and happy demeanor aren't noted. Prader-Willi syndrome has hypotonia and feeding issues early on but later leads to hyperphagia, which isn't mentioned.\n\nThe vignette mentions awaiting genetic test results, which is crucial, but based on the presented symptoms, Cri-du-chat seems the most fitting. The primary diagnosis should be a chromosomal abnormality disorder. For DSM-5-TR, this falls under \"Other Specified Neurodevelopmental Disorder\" linked to a known medical condition, like a genetic syndrome. The ICD-10 code for Cri-du-chat is Q93.4, but that's not an F-code. Psychiatric diagnoses related to this would be neurodevelopmental disorders due to the genetic condition. Since the child is only 12 months old, specific developmental delays aren't detailed, but the hypotonia and feeding issues suggest Global Developmental Delay. \n\nSo, the primary diagnosis should be Global Developmental Delay due to Cri-du-chat syndrome, coded under F88. However, in DSM-5, Global Developmental Delay is for under-5s when clinical severity can't be reliably assessed. Here, the genetic cause is suspected but not confirmed, so it's appropriate. Other secondary diagnoses could include Feeding and Eating Disorders of Infancy or Early Childhood (F98.2) due to the gastroenterology involvement, and maybe Unspecified Intellectual Disability (F79) given the developmental concerns, though it's early for that. Also, the heart defect might relate to Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions (F54), but that's less direct. \n\nWait, the instructions say to base diagnoses only on the vignette and clinical expertise, without fabricating details. The genetic testing is pending, so the diagnosis isn't confirmed, but the symptoms strongly point to Cri-du-chat. For DSM-5-TR, the appropriate code for Global Developmental Delay is F88, and for Feeding Disorder, it's F98.2. The congenital anomalies like heart defect and physical features are medical conditions, not psychiatric, so they shouldn't be listed as primary psychiatric diagnoses. \n\nThus, the primary psychiatric diagnosis is Global Developmental Delay due to suspected genetic syndrome (Cri-du-chat), with secondary diagnoses including Feeding Disorder, and possibly other neurodevelopmental issues. Let me structure the list with F-codes as requested.",

Ms. Jacobs had a history of mood symptoms that had been under good control with lithium and sertraline, but her depressive symptoms had returned soon after she had arrived in a new city for school, 3 months earlier. She had become preoccupied with ways in which she might kill herself without inconveniencing others. Her dominant suicidal thoughts involved shooting herself in the head while leaning out the window, so as not to cause a mess in the dorm. Although she did not have access to a gun, she spent time searching the Web for places where she might purchase one.\n\nMs. Jacobs\u2019s psychiatric history began at age 15, when she began to regularly drink alcohol and smoke marijuana, usually when out at dance clubs with friends. Both of these substances calmed her, and she denied that either had become problematic. She had used neither alcohol nor marijuana since starting graduate school.\n\nAround age 17, she began experiencing brief, intense depressive episodes, marked by tearfulness, feelings of guilt, anhedonia, hopelessness, low energy, and poor concentration. She would sleep more than 12 hours a day and neglect responsibilities at school and home.\n\nThese depressive episodes would generally shift after a few weeks into periods of increased energy, pressured speech, and unusual creativity. She would stay up most of the night working on projects and building architectural models. These revved-up episodes lasted about 5 days and were punctuated by feelings that her friends had turned against her and that they were not really friends at all. Worried especially about the paranoia, her family had brought her to a psychiatrist, who diagnosed her as having bipolar II disorder and prescribed lithium and sertraline. Although Ms. Jacobs\u2019s moods did not completely stabilize on this regimen, she did well enough at a local university to be accepted into a prestigious graduate program far from home. At that point the depression returned, and she became intensely suicidal for the first time.\n\nUpon evaluation, the patient was visibly depressed and tearful, and had psychomotor slowing. She said it was very difficult to get out of bed and she was not attending class most days. She reported hopelessness, poor concentration, and guilt about spending family money for school when she was not able to perform. She stated that she thought about suicide most of the time and that she had found nothing to distract her. She denied recent drinking or smoking marijuana, stating she did not feel like \u201cpartying.\u201d She acknowledged profound feelings of emptiness and indicated that she had occasionally cut her arms superficially to \u201csee what it would feel like.\u201d She stated that she knew that cutting herself in this way would not kill her.

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully extracting all the relevant information from the clinical vignette. The patient is a 22-year-old graduate student with a history of mood symptoms since age 15, including alcohol and marijuana use. She has a previous diagnosis of bipolar II disorder with prescribed lithium and sertraline. Her symptoms returned after moving to a new city three months ago, leading to suicidal ideation with specific plans, though no access to means currently.\n\nFirst, I need to organize the data. Key points include: history of depressive episodes with symptoms like anhedonia, guilt, low energy, poor concentration, hypersomnia, followed by hypomanic episodes with increased energy, pressured speech, creativity, decreased need for sleep, and paranoia. Current presentation shows severe depression, psychomotor slowing, hopelessness, poor concentration, guilt, suicidal thoughts with a plan, self-harm behaviors (cutting), feelings of emptiness, depersonalization, and panic attacks. Denies current substance use, mood instability, derealization, impulsivity, identity concerns, or fear of abandonment.\n\nNow, considering the diagnostic reasoning. The primary diagnosis should align with the recurring mood episodes. Bipolar II disorder fits given the history of hypomanic and depressive episodes, despite current treatment. However, the current severe depressive episode with suicidal ideation is prominent. The patient also shows self-harm and emptiness, which might suggest borderline personality traits, but she denies key features like fear of abandonment or identity issues. \n\nOther considerations: Major depressive disorder is possible, but the hypomanic episodes rule that out. Substance-induced mood disorder isn't likely as she's not currently using. Panic disorder is mentioned due to panic attacks. Depersonalization\/derealization disorder might be considered given depersonalization, but derealization is denied. The cutting behavior and emptiness could point to borderline personality disorder, but the denial of other criteria makes it less likely as a primary diagnosis.\n\nTop five diagnoses: Bipolar II disorder as primary due to the clear history. Current severe depressive episode as secondary because it's the acute issue. Panic disorder for the panic attacks. Borderline personality disorder traits or diagnosis given self-harm and emptiness, though not full criteria. Finally, other specified depressive disorder if the current episode doesn't fully align, but that seems less likely. Wait, need to check DSM-5 codes. Bipolar II disorder is F31.81, current depressive episode severe is F32.2, panic disorder is F41.0, borderline personality disorder is F60.3. For the fifth, perhaps other specified bipolar disorder if there's uncertainty, but the history seems clear. Alternatively, adjustment disorder with depressed mood could be considered due to the move, but the recurrent mood episodes point more to bipolar.

    "vignette":"Ashley, age 17, was referred for a diagnostic reevaluation after having carried diagnoses of autism and intellectual disability for almost all of her life. She was recently found to have Kleefstra syndrome, and the family wanted to reconfirm the earlier diagnoses and assess the genetic risk to the future children of her older sisters.\n\nAt the time of the reevaluation, Ashley was attending a special school with a focus on functional skills. She was able to dress herself, but she was not able to shower independently or be left alone in the house. She was able to decode (e.g., read words) and spell at a second-grade level but understood little of what she read. Changes to her schedule and heightened functional expectations tended to make her irritable. When upset, Ashley would often hurt herself (e.g., biting her wrist) and others (e.g., pinching and hair pulling).\n\nIn formal testing done at the time of the reevaluation, Ashley had a nonverbal IQ of 39 and a verbal IQ of 23, with a full scale IQ of 31. Her adaptive scores were somewhat higher, with an overall score of 42 (with 100 as average).\n\nBy history, Ashley first received services at age 9 months after her parents noticed significant motor delays. She walked at 20 months and was toilet trained at 5 years. She spoke her first word at age 6. She received a diagnosis of developmental delay at age 3 and of autism, obesity, and static encephalopathy at age 4. An early evaluation noted possible facial dysmorphology; genetic tests at that time were noncontributory.\n\nHer parents indicated that Ashley knew hundreds of single words and many simple phrases. She had long been very interested in license plates and would draw them for hours. Her strongest skill was memory, and she could draw precise representations of license plates from different states. Ashley had always been very attached to her parents and sisters, and although affectionate toward babies, she showed minimal interest in other teenagers.\n\nAshley\u2019s family history was pertinent for a father with dyslexia, a paternal uncle with epilepsy, and a maternal male cousin with possible \u201cAsperger\u2019s syndrome.\u201d Her siblings, both sisters, were in college and doing well.\n\nOn examination, Ashley was an overweight young woman who made inconsistent eye contact but often peered out the corner of her eye. She had a beautiful smile and would sometimes laugh to herself, but most of the time her facial expressions were subdued. She did not initiate joint attention by trying to catch another person\u2019s eyes. She frequently ignored what others would say to her. To request a preferred object (e.g., a shiny magazine), Ashley would rock from foot to foot and point. When offered an object (e.g., a small decorated box), she brought it to her nose and lips for inspection. Ashley spoke in a high-pitched voice with unusual intonation. During the interview, she used multiple words and a few short phrases that were somewhat rote but communicative, such as \u201cI want to clean up,\u201d and \u201cDo you have a van?\u201d\n\nIn the months prior to the evaluation, Ashley\u2019s parents noticed that she had become increasingly apathetic. A medical evaluation concluded that urinary tract infections were the most likely cause for her symptoms, but antibiotics seemed only to make her more listless. Further medical evaluation led to more extensive genetic testing, and Ashley was diagnosed with Kleefstra syndrome, a rare genetic defect associated with multiple medical problems, including intellectual developmental disorder. The parents said they were also tested and found to \u201cbe negative.\u201d\n\nThe parents specifically wanted to know whether the genetic testing results affected Ashley\u2019s long-standing diagnoses and access to future services.

I need to extract relevant psychiatric symptoms and history to form my differential diagnosis.\n\nKey points from the vignette:\n\n- Age: 17.\n\n- Previous diagnoses: Autism and intellectual disability.\n\n- Genetic condition: Kleefstra syndrome, associated with intellectual developmental disorder and other medical problems.\n\n- Symptoms and behaviors:\n\n  - Irritability with changes in schedule or heightened expectations.\n\n  - Self-injurious behavior (biting wrist) and aggression towards others (pinching, hair pulling).\n\n  - Low IQ: nonverbal IQ 39, verbal IQ 23, full scale IQ 31, indicating severe intellectual disability.\n\n  - Adaptive scores: overall 42, which is below average.\n\n  - Developmental history: Motor delays, walked at 20 months, toilet trained at 5 years, first word at age 6.\n\n  - Social and communication issues: Inconsistent eye contact, peers out of corner of eye, does not initiate joint attention, ignores others, uses rote phrases, high-pitched voice with unusual intonation.\n\n  - Restricted interests: Interest in license plates, draws them for hours, strong memory for them.\n\n  - Social attachment: Attached to parents and sisters, affectionate towards babies, minimal interest in other teenagers.\n\n  - Recent apathy: Increased apathy, possibly related to medical issues like UTIs, but antibiotics made her more listless.\n\n  - Family history: Father with dyslexia, paternal uncle with epilepsy, maternal male cousin with possible Asperger\u2019s syndrome.\n\n- The parents want to know if genetic testing affects her long-standing diagnoses and access to services, and genetic risk for other daughters.\n\nNow, I need to list the top 5 DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses. Since this is a psychiatric evaluation, I should focus on mental disorders. Kleefstra syndrome is a genetic medical condition, but it's not a psychiatric diagnosis per se; however, it can be associated with psychiatric symptoms. DSM-5-TR includes conditions like Intellectual Disability (now called Intellectual Developmental Disorder) and Autism Spectrum Disorder.\n\nBased on the vignette:\n\n1. **Intellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder)**: Her IQ scores are in the severe range (full scale IQ 31), and adaptive functioning is impaired. This is a core diagnosis.\n\n2. **Autism Spectrum Disorder**: She has symptoms like restricted interests (license plates), social communication deficits (inconsistent eye contact, lack of joint attention, rote speech), and repetitive behaviors (rocking, self-injury). These align with ASD.\n\n3. **Behavioral issues**: She exhibits irritability, self-injurious behavior, and aggression. This could be part of ASD or co-occurring conditions. In DSM-5, these might be captured under other disorders, but since she has intellectual disability and ASD, additional diagnoses might be considered if symptoms are severe enough.\n\n   - Possible diagnoses: Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) if irritability is prominent, but she's 17, and DMDD is for children up to 18, but onset before age 10. Her irritability seems related to changes, so it might be part of ASD.\n\n   - Alternatively, for self-injury and aggression, it could be categorized under Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder, or as a symptom of ASD.\n\n4. **Apathy**: Recent increase in apathy. This could be due to medical issues like UTIs or the genetic syndrome, but in psychiatric terms, it might relate to depressive disorders or other conditions.\n\n   - Possible: Depressive Disorder due to Another Medical Condition (Kleefstra syndrome), or Major Depressive Disorder.\n\n5. **Genetic syndrome impact**: Kleefstra syndrome is associated with intellectual disability and may have psychiatric manifestations. But since it's a medical condition, I should list psychiatric diagnoses that are separate or co-occurring.\n\nDSM-5-TR allows for diagnosing disorders even when due to medical conditions, but I need to specify if they are due to another medical condition.\n\nList likely psychiatric diagnoses:\n\n- Primary diagnosis: Intellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder) - severe.\n\n- Secondary: Autism Spectrum Disorder.\n\n- Secondary: Possible mood or behavioral disorder. Given the irritability and apathy, I should consider a mood disorder.\n\n  - For irritability: Could be Irritable Mood as part of a depressive disorder or other.\n\n  - For apathy: Could be part of depressive disorder.\n\nBut I need to base on DSM-5-TR. Also, the vignette mentions self-injury and aggression, which might be symptoms of ASD or could warrant a separate diagnosis if not better explained by ASD.\n\nIn DSM-5, for individuals with ASD and intellectual disability, additional diagnoses are given if symptoms are prominent and not part of ASD.\n\nFrom the information:\n\n- She has Kleefstra syndrome, which is a genetic disorder causing intellectual disability. So, Intellectual Developmental Disorder is likely due to the genetic condition.\n\n- Autism Spectrum Disorder is often co-occurring with intellectual disability.\n\n- The behavioral issues: self-injury and aggression. In DSM-5, this could be classified as Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder, or as a symptom of another disorder.\n\n- Apathy: Could be Depressive Disorder due to Another Medical Condition (Kleefstra syndrome) or Major Depressive Disorder.\n\nNow, for the top 5 diagnoses:\n\n1. **Intellectual Developmental Disorder** (severe) - this is clear from IQ and adaptive functioning.\n\n2. **Autism Spectrum Disorder** - with associated intellectual impairment and requiring substantial support.\n\n3. **Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder**? But she's 17, and DMDD requires onset before age 10, and chronic irritability. Her irritability seems situational (changes in schedule), but it might fit.\n\n   - Alternatively, **Irritability associated with another medical condition** or **Unspecified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder**.\n\n4. **Self-injurious behavior** could be coded as **Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder** if it's a focus.\n\n5. **Depressive Disorder due to Another Medical Condition** for apathy.\n\nBut I need to prioritize based on the vignette. The primary issues are intellectual disability and autism.\n\nLet's list the diagnoses in order of likelihood:\n\n- Primary: Intellectual Developmental Disorder (since it's severe and central).\n\n- Secondary: Autism Spectrum Disorder.\n\n- Then, behavioral symptoms: perhaps a diagnosis for the self-injury and aggression.\n\n- Apathy: might be part of a depressive disorder.\n\n- Also, considering the genetic syndrome, but that's not a psychiatric diagnosis.\n\nFor ICD-10 F-codes:\n\n- Intellectual Disability: F70-F79. Severe intellectual disability is F72.\n\n- Autism Spectrum Disorder: F84.0.\n\n- For behavioral issues: if irritability is prominent, F34.8 (Other persistent mood disorders) or for disruptive behavior, F91.8 (Other conduct disorders).\n\n- For self-injury: sometimes coded under F98.4 (Stereotyped movement disorders) if it's repetitive, but here it's when upset, so might be impulsive.\n\n- Depressive disorder: F32.9 (Unspecified depressive disorder) or F06.31 (Depressive disorder due to another medical condition).\n\nI need to be precise. Based on DSM-5-TR:\n\n1. **Intellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder), Severe** - ICD-10: F72.\n\n2. **Autism Spectrum Disorder** - ICD-10: F84.0.\n\n3. **Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder** (for self-injurious behavior and aggression) - ICD-10: F91.8.\n\n4. **Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition** (Kleefstra syndrome) - ICD-10: F06.31.\n\n5. Perhaps **Anxiety Disorder** due to changes in schedule, but not explicitly mentioned. Or **Unspecified Neurodevelopmental Disorder** but she already has ASD and ID.\n\nThe vignette mentions irritability with changes, which could be anxiety-related. But apathy is more prominent recently.\n\nAnother possibility: **Stereotypic Movement Disorder** for self-injurious behavior, but it's not stereotyped in the sense of rhythmic; it's when upset.\n\nIn DSM-5, self-injurious behavior can be part of Stereotypic Movement Disorder if it's repetitive and seemingly purposeless. Here, it's in response to upset, so might be better as part of a disruptive behavior disorder.\n\nI think for the top 5:\n\n1. Intellectual Developmental Disorder, Severe\n\n2. Autism Spectrum Disorder\n\n3. Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (for apathy)\n\n4. Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder (for aggression and self-injury)\n\n5. Perhaps no fifth, but I need five. Could be **Unspecified Anxiety Disorder** or **Adjustment Disorder**, but not clearly stated.\n\nThe vignette is focused on reconfirming autism and intellectual disability, so those are primary.\n\nFor the list, I'll include:\n\n1. Intellectual Developmental Disorder, Severe - F72\n\n2. Autism Spectrum Disorder - F84.0\n\n3. Depressive Disorder Due to Kleefstra Syndrome - F06.31\n\n4. Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder - F91.8\n\n5. For the fifth, perhaps **Stereotypic Movement Disorder with Self-Injurious Behavior** - F98.4, but her self-injury is not described as stereotypic; it's biting wrist when upset.\n\nAlternatively, since she has Kleefstra syndrome, which is a medical condition, and psychiatric symptoms are due to it, but in DSM-5, we diagnose the psychiatric disorders separately.\n\nI should list diagnoses that are most supported by the vignette.\n\nFinal list:\n\n- Primary: Intellectual Developmental Disorder (given the IQ and adaptive scores).\n\n- Then Autism Spectrum Disorder.\n\n- Behavioral issues: The self-injury and aggression could be under **Disruptive Behavior Disorder Not Otherwise Specified** or similar.\n\n- Apathy: Depressive symptoms.\n\nFor ICD-10 codes:\n\n- F72: Severe mental retardation (Intellectual Disability, severe)\n\n- F84.0: Childhood autism (Autism Spectrum Disorder)\n\n- F91.8: Other conduct disorders\n\n- F06.31: Depressive disorder due to known physiological condition\n\n- For fifth: F98.4: Stereotyped movement disorders, but might not fit perfectly.\n\nPerhaps **Unspecified Mood Disorder** for irritability and apathy, but I have depressive disorder already.\n\nI think four are clear, and for the fifth, I can include **Other Specified Neurodevelopmental Disorder** but she already has ID and ASD, so redundant.\n\nAnother idea: **Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder**? Not mentioned.\n\n**Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder**? But she has ASD, which encompasses that.\n\nI need to output five diagnoses. Let's stick with the most likely.\n\nUpon second thought, in the vignette, the parents want to know if genetic testing affects diagnoses. So, the existing diagnoses are still valid, but with the genetic cause identified.\n\nFor DSM-5, Intellectual Developmental Disorder can be specified if due to a genetic condition, but the code remains the same.\n\nSo, for the list:\n\n1. Intellectual Developmental Disorder, Severe - F72\n\n2. Autism Spectrum Disorder - F84.0\n\n3. Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (Kleefstra syndrome) - F06.31\n\n4. Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder - F91.8\n\n5. Stereotypic Movement Disorder - F98.4 (for the self-injurious behavior, but it might be part of the other disorders)\n\nI think Stereotypic Movement Disorder is less likely because the self-injury is context-dependent (when upset), not stereotypic in nature.\n\nPerhaps **Unspecified Impulse-Control Disorder** for the aggression.\n\nI'll go with:\n\n1. Intellectual Developmental Disorder, Severe - F72\n\n2. Autism Spectrum Disorder - F84.0\n\n3. Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition - F06.31\n\n4. Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder - F91.8\n\n5. For the fifth, since she has a genetic syndrome, and it might be associated with other issues, but psychiatric, I can say **Unspecified Neurodevelopmental Disorder** but that's vague.\n\nAnother possibility: **Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition** for irritability with changes, but apathy is more prominent.\n\nI think four are sufficient, but the instruction says to give five. So, I'll include a less specific one.\n\nPerhaps **Unspecified Mood Disorder** for the irritability and apathy, but I already have depressive disorder.\n\nLet's list the diagnoses as per DSM-5-TR hierarchy.\n\nPrimary diagnosis: The core is Intellectual Developmental Disorder.\n\nThen, co-occurring Autism Spectrum Disorder.\n\nThen, for behavioral symptoms: a disruptive behavior disorder.\n\nFor mood: depressive disorder.\n\nAnd for the fifth, since she has self-injury, which could be a focus, **Other Specified Mental Disorder** or something.\n\nI recall that in DSM-5, for self-injurious behavior without suicidal intent, it can be classified as **Non-Suicidal Self-Injury**, but that's a condition for further study, not an official diagnosis. So, probably not.\n\nI think I'll go with:\n\n1. Intellectual Developmental Disorder, Severe - F72\n\n2. Autism Spectrum Disorder - F84.0\n\n3. Depressive Disorder Due to Kleefstra Syndrome - F06.31\n\n4. Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder - F91.8\n\n5. Stereotypic Movement Disorder - F98.4 (assuming the self-injury has a repetitive element)\n\nBut in the vignette, she bites wrist when upset, which is not stereotypic; it's reactive. So, better to have **Unspecified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder** but I already have other specified.\n\nTo differentiate, for the fourth, I can specify the behavioral issues.\n\nPerhaps for the fifth, **Unspecified Anxiety Disorder** since changes cause irritability, which might be anxiety.\n\nBut let's see the symptoms: \"Changes to her schedule and heightened functional expectations tended to make her irritable.\" This could be anxiety or stress-related.\n\nSo, **Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood**? But it's chronic.\n\nI think depressive disorder covers the apathy.\n\nFor the output, I'll list the diagnoses I have.\n\nStructured list:\n\n1. Intellectual Developmental Disorder, Severe - F72\n\n2. Autism Spectrum Disorder - F84.0\n\n3. Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (Kleefstra syndrome) - F06.31\n\n4. Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder (with aggressive and self-injurious behaviors) - F91.8\n\n5. For the fifth, I'll add **Unspecified Anxiety Disorder** - F41.9, to cover the irritability related to changes.\n\nBut is there enough for anxiety? Not explicitly, so perhaps not.\n\nAnother idea: **Reactive Attachment Disorder**? But she is attached to parents, so no.\n\n**Social Anxiety Disorder**? Minimal interest in peers, but that's part of ASD.\n\nI think for the fifth, since she has intellectual disability, and behavioral issues are common, I can include **Unspecified Neurodevelopmental Disorder** but that's redundant.\n\nI recall that Kleefstra syndrome is associated with psychiatric features like apathy, withdrawal, and sometimes psychotic symptoms, but not mentioned here.\n\nIn the vignette, she laughs to herself sometimes, which could be inappropriate affect, but not enough for a diagnosis.\n\nI think I'll proceed with the four core and add one more based on common co-occurrences.\n\nUpon reading the vignette again, the primary concern is intellectual disability and autism, and the recent apathy.\n\nSo, for the list:\n\n1. Intellectual Developmental Disorder, Severe - F72\n\n2. Autism Spectrum Disorder - F84.0\n\n3. Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition - F06.31\n\n4. Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder - F91.8\n\n5. Stereotypic Movement Disorder? Or perhaps **Unspecified Impulse-Control Disorder** - F63.9\n\nBut for impulse-control, the aggression and self-injury might fit.\n\nI think F91.8 covers it.\n\nFor the fifth, I'll use **Unspecified Mood Disorder** - F39, to capture the irritability and apathy broadly.\n\nBut depressive disorder is already specified.\n\nI need to make a decision.\n\nLet's list the diagnoses in order of evidence:\n\n- Intellectual Disability: Strong evidence.\n\n- Autism Spectrum Disorder: Strong evidence.\n\n- Behavioral disturbances: Evidence for aggression and self-injury.\n\n- Mood symptoms: Evidence for apathy, possibly depressive.\n\n- No clear evidence for anxiety, psychosis, etc.\n\nSo, for the fifth, I can include **Other Specified Mental Disorder** due to another medical condition, but that's vague.\n\nPerhaps **Neurobehavioral Disorder Associated with Prenatal Alcohol Exposure**? Not applicable.\n\nI think for the purpose of this task, I'll include:\n\n5. **Unspecified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder** but I already have other specified.\n\nTo avoid duplication, for the fourth, use \"Other Specified\", and for the fifth, use something else.\n\nAnother thought: in DSM-5, for individuals with intellectual disability, additional diagnoses are given only if symptoms are beyond what is expected from the intellectual disability. Here, self-injury and aggression might be part of the syndrome or ASD.\n\nBut for the list, I'll go with:\n\n1. Intellectual Developmental Disorder, Severe - F72\n\n2. Autism Spectrum Disorder - F84.0\n\n3. Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (Kleefstra syndrome) - F06.31\n\n4. Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder (with aggressive and self-injurious behaviors) - F91.8\n\n5. Stereotypic Movement Disorder - F98.4 (for the repetitive drawing of license plates, but that's an interest, not a movement disorder. Self-injury might be stereotypic, but described as when upset.)\n\nThe drawing for hours could be a restricted interest in ASD, not a movement disorder.\n\nPerhaps for the fifth, **Unspecified Neurodevelopmental Disorder** but that's not accurate.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating. Let's output the most likely.\n\nFinal list:\n\n1. Intellectual Developmental Disorder, Severe - F72\n\n2. Autism Spectrum Disorder - F84.0\n\n3. Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition - F06.31\n\n4. Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder - F91.8\n\n5. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder - F41.9 (to account for irritability with changes)\n\nI think that's acceptable.",

    "vignette":"George Anderson, a 73-year-old married man, was referred to a psychiatrist for an evaluation of depression after screening positive on the Geriatric Depression Scale during a neurology appointment. For most of the 2 years since his diagnosis with Parkinson\u2019s disease, Mr. Anderson had coped well and continued to engage in many of his usual activities. His wife of 49 years noted that 1\u20132 years before developing Parkinson\u2019s disease, Mr. Anderson had become somewhat less enthusiastic and motivated compared with his baseline personality, but not to the point of causing any concern or impairment. The only other neuropsychiatric symptom preceding his Parkinson\u2019s diagnosis was his wife\u2019s report that during the past 5 years he frequently \u201cthrashed about\u201d while asleep.\n\nThree months prior to the referral, however, Mr. Anderson began to decline social invitations from family and friends. He reported that he had withdrawn socially because he had lost pleasure in things that used to excite him, although he denied persistent feelings of sadness or worry. He recognized that he was not his \u201cusual self\u201d and tried, to no avail, to give himself \u201cpep talks.\u201d He had worked as a high school science teacher until retirement at age 67, and reported having learned \u201cthe power of seeing the glass half full\u201d from his students. He felt frustrated that he could not \u201csnap out of it\u201d for the first time in his life but was hopeful about getting professional help. He denied wishing for death, explaining that although he was not afraid of death, he wanted to enjoy life as long as possible. He added, \u201cGod does not give me more than I can handle. I can\u2019t ask for a better family, and I have had a full life.\u201d\n\nOther new symptoms over the prior few months included increasing fatigue, impaired concentration and memory, unintentional weight loss, and sleep-onset insomnia. Further history on his more chronic sleep symptoms revealed that, around 3:00 a.m. or 4:00 a.m. on most nights, Mr. Anderson began violently moving his extremities and moaning as though in distress, all while still seemingly asleep in bed. He often awakened his wife with these movements and occasionally struck her in his sleep. She sometimes used a different bedroom because of this. When he awoke from such an incident, he was coherent and briefly anxious, often reporting that he had been dreaming of swimming or running from something.\n\nHis wife took over driving shortly after his Parkinson\u2019s disease diagnosis, but Mr. Anderson was otherwise independent in activities of daily living such as paying bills and managing his medications. His wife described him as \u201cmaybe a little more forgetful\u201d over the past few years, but neither of them was concerned about this mild memory loss.\n\nPast medical history included prostate cancer (in remission), glaucoma, and gout. Labs from his recent neurology visit were unremarkable, including blood counts, serum chemistries, thyroid function, and vitamin B12 levels. Family psychiatric history was positive only for a granddaughter with ADHD. He denied past problematic substance use and all current substance use except two or three glasses of wine monthly. He denied any previous depressive episodes, psychiatric treatment, or psychiatric evaluations.\n\nOn mental status examination, Mr. Anderson was pleasant, cooperative, and interpersonally engaging. Resting tremor, shuffling gait, hypophonia, and bradykinesia all were evident at mild to moderate levels. He occasionally smiled, but his affect was difficult to fully gauge because of masked facies. He reported his mood as \u201cblah.\u201d There was no evidence of psychosis.\n\nOn cognitive testing, he had some difficulty on the Trail Making Test part B, figure copying, and word-list recall, the latter being helped by category prompts. On a standardized brief cognitive assessment, he scored 25 out of 30 points, which was in the normal range.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me break down what I need to do here. The user wants me to act as an expert psychiatrist diagnosing a patient based on the given clinical vignette. I have to follow the rubric provided, aiming for Level 5 in both data extraction and diagnostic reasoning. But the user specified that my response should only be a structured list of diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes, without including any clinical reasoning. So even though the rubric emphasizes reasoning, I shouldn't output that part.\n\nFirst, I need to carefully extract all relevant information from the vignette. Mr. Anderson is a 73-year-old man with Parkinson's disease, referred for depression. Key points: symptoms started 1-2 years before Parkinson's diagnosis with reduced enthusiasm and motivation. Then, three months prior, he declined social invitations, lost pleasure, but denied sadness or worry. He has fatigue, concentration\/memory issues, weight loss, sleep-onset insomnia. Also, there's a history of violent sleep movements for the past five years, possibly REM sleep behavior disorder. His wife mentions mild memory loss. Medical history includes prostate cancer, glaucoma, gout. Labs normal. No substance abuse. Mental status shows Parkinson's symptoms, mood \"blah,\" no psychosis. Cognitive testing shows some deficits but within normal range.\n\nNow, organizing this data. The timeline is crucial: neuropsychiatric symptoms predate Parkinson's diagnosis. Sleep disturbances (REM behavior disorder) started five years ago. Recent depressive symptoms but without prominent sadness\u2014more anhedonia and loss of motivation. Cognitive issues are present but mild. The presence of Parkinson's disease is key because it's often associated with neuropsychiatric conditions.\n\nFor differential diagnosis, the primary issue seems to be depression, but given the Parkinson's diagnosis, it might be part of a broader neuropsychiatric syndrome. The anhedonia and lack of motivation could point to apathy, which is common in Parkinson's. The sleep disturbances are characteristic of REM sleep behavior disorder, often a precursor to synucleinopathies like Parkinson's. Cognitive deficits, though mild, could indicate mild cognitive impairment or early dementia related to Parkinson's.\n\nConsidering DSM-5-TR criteria, Major Depressive Disorder is possible, but the absence of persistent sadness and the presence of anhedonia and other somatic symptoms might lean towards Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (Parkinson's). The sleep issues are clearly REM Sleep Behavior Disorder. The cognitive issues could be Mild Neurocognitive Disorder due to Parkinson's. Also, the reduced motivation and enthusiasm before Parkinson's diagnosis might indicate Apathy.\n\nSo, top diagnoses: \n1. Depressive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease, with depressive features (since the depression is temporally related to Parkinson's and lacks typical sadness, more anhedonia).\n2. REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (well-documented violent sleep movements, dreaming, striking wife).\n3. Mild Neurocognitive Disorder due to Parkinson's Disease (cognitive deficits on testing but still functional).\n4. Apathy (as a separate or comorbid condition, given the lack of motivation predating depression).\n5. Major Depressive Disorder (possible but less likely due to the medical context and atypical presentation).\n\nChecking ICD-10 codes: \n- F06.31 for Depressive Disorder Due to Parkinson's\n- G47.52 for REM Sleep Behavior Disorder, but wait, that's not an F-code. REM Sleep Behavior Disorder is under sleep-wake disorders in DSM-5 but ICD-10 uses G47.52, which is neurological. The user said only psychiatric diagnoses with F-codes, so maybe exclude that? But the user specified DSM-5-TR diagnoses, which includes sleep disorders. However, the instruction says \"Do not include non-psychiatric diagnoses that do not use F-codes.\" REM Sleep Behavior Disorder in ICD-10 is G47.52, not an F-code. So I should replace it with another psychiatric diagnosis. Maybe Adjustment Disorder? But the symptoms are chronic. Alternatively, Other Specified Depressive Disorder? Let me reconsider.\n\nThe user wants top 5 psychiatric diagnoses with F-codes. So REM Sleep Behavior Disorder might not qualify as it's not primarily psychiatric in ICD-10. Instead, consider other conditions like Persistent Depressive Disorder? But the depressive symptoms are recent (3 months). Maybe Unspecified Anxiety Disorder? He has brief anxiety upon waking. But not prominent. Alternatively, since apathy is a symptom, but in DSM-5, apathy isn't a standalone diagnosis; it's a specifier or part of other disorders. Perhaps Other Specified Neurocognitive Disorder? But Mild Neurocognitive Disorder is already there.\n\nWait, the user said \"DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses\" and \"corresponding ICD-10 F-codes.\" So I need to list DSM-5 diagnoses that have F-codes. REM Sleep Behavior Disorder in DSM-5 is coded as G47.52, not an F-code. So I should exclude it from the list. Instead, include other relevant psychiatric conditions.\n\nPossible alternatives: \n- Anxiety Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease (F06.4) because he has brief anxiety upon waking.\n- Unspecified Neurocognitive Disorder (F06.8) if Mild Neurocognitive Disorder isn't appropriate, but Mild NCD is in DSM-5.\n- Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood (F43.21) but the stressor is chronic illness, and symptoms exceed typical adjustment.\n\nGiven the anhedonia and lack of sadness, maybe Other Specified Depressive Disorder (F32.8). But Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition seems more accurate.\n\nAlso, Apathy is not a separate diagnosis in DSM-5, so I can't list it. Instead, it might be part of the depressive disorder or neurocognitive disorder.\n\nSo revised list:\n1. Depressive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease, With Depressive Features (F06.31)\n2. Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease (F06.7)\n3. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder (due to the brief anxiety episodes upon waking, possibly related to REM behavior disorder) (F41.8)\n4. Adjustment Disorder With Depressed Mood (F43.21) \u2013 less likely but possible given the life changes.\n5. Unspecified Neurocognitive Disorder (F06.8) if Mild NCD isn't fully met, but cognitive testing shows deficits.\n\nBut the vignette says cognitive testing is in normal range (25\/30), so Mild NCD might not be fully supported. DSM-5 criteria for Mild NCD require modest cognitive decline, but the vignette says \"in the normal range,\" so maybe not. However, the earlier mention of difficulty on Trail Making Test, figure copying, and word-list recall suggests some deficits. The score of 25\/30 is borderline, so Mild NCD is possible but uncertain.\n\nAlternatively, consider Substance\/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder? But he only has minimal alcohol use, so unlikely.\n\nAnother possibility: Bereavement? No mention of loss.\n\nMaybe Hoarding Disorder? Not mentioned.\n\nGiven the sleep disturbances are prominent, but since REM Sleep Behavior Disorder isn't psychiatric in ICD-10, I'll exclude it. However, the anxiety related to sleep might be captured under anxiety disorder.\n\nSo finalizing:\nPrimary: Depressive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease (F06.31)\nSecondary: Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease (F06.7) \u2013 despite normal score, the specific deficits noted might justify this.\nSecondary: Other Specified Anxiety Disorder (F41.8) for the anxiety upon waking.\nSecondary: Adjustment Disorder With Depressed Mood (F43.21) as an alternative if the depression is primarily a reaction to Parkinson's.\nSecondary: Unspecified Depressive Disorder (F32.9) if the due to another medical condition isn't clear, but it seems clear here.\n\nWait, the user said \"top 5 most likely diagnoses,\" so I should prioritize based on likelihood. Depressive disorder due to Parkinson's is most likely. Then REM Sleep Behavior Disorder is very likely but not an F-code, so skip. Mild Neurocognitive Disorder is plausible. Anxiety disorder due to Parkinson's is possible. Adjustment disorder is less likely given the duration and medical context. Maybe Other Specified Depressive Disorder for the atypical presentation without sadness.\n\nAlternatively, since apathy is prominent, but no DSM-5 code, maybe list Other Specified Neurocognitive Disorder with behavioral disturbance.\n\nI think I'll go with:\n1. Depressive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease, With Depressive Features (F06.31)\n2. Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease (F06.7)\n3. Anxiety Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease (F06.4)\n4. Other Specified Depressive Disorder (F32.8) \u2013 for the anhedonia without sadness.\n5. Unspecified Neurocognitive Disorder (F06.8) \u2013 if Mild NCD isn't fully met.\n\nBut let's check the DSM-5 criteria. For Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition, requires prominent and persistent period of depressed mood or markedly diminished interest\/pleasure. He has diminished interest\/pleasure, so meets that. For Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition, requires prominent anxiety, but he only has brief anxiety upon waking, so maybe not prominent. So perhaps not anxiety disorder.\n\nMaybe Insomnia Disorder? He has sleep-onset insomnia, but also the REM behavior disorder, which is more specific.\n\nGiven the instructions, I'll list only psychiatric diagnoses with F-codes. So:\n1. F06.31 \u2013 Depressive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease, With Depressive Features\n2. F06.7 \u2013 Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease\n3. F51.01 \u2013 Primary Insomnia? But Insomnia Disorder in DSM-5 is coded as F51.01, which is an F-code. He has sleep-onset insomnia, so that fits.\n4. F41.8 \u2013 Other Specified Anxiety Disorder (for the anxiety episodes)\n5. F43.21 \u2013 Adjustment Disorder With Depressed Mood\n\nBut Adjustment Disorder usually occurs within 3 months of a stressor, and here the stressor (Parkinson's) was 2 years ago, but the depressive symptoms started 3 months ago, so maybe a reaction to the progression or something. Possible.\n\nAlternatively, since he has mild memory loss, maybe Unspecified Neurocognitive Disorder (F06.8).\n\nI think Insomnia Disorder is a good addition because it's a separate sleep-wake disorder with an F-code.\n\nSo final list:\n1. Depressive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease, With Depressive Features \u2013 F06.31\n2. Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease \u2013 F06.7\n3. Insomnia Disorder \u2013 F51.01\n4. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder \u2013 F41.8\n5. Adjustment Disorder With Depressed Mood \u2013 F43.21\n\nYes, that seems reasonable. I'll output that.",

    "vignette":"A psychiatric transplant liaison service was called to evaluate Robert Jennings, a 50-year-old married white man, for a liver transplant in the context of an alcohol use disorder, advanced cirrhosis, and no other prior psychiatric history. Several weeks earlier, he had been hospitalized with acute alcohol-associated hepatitis and diagnosed with end-stage liver disease. Prednisolone 40 mg\/day was prescribed for treatment of the hepatitis. Prior to that hospitalization, he had been unaware that his alcohol consumption was seriously damaging his health and was shocked to learn that he would eventually require a liver transplant. Upon discharge, he began an addiction treatment program that was mandatory for him to be listed for possible transplantation.\n\nOutpatient psychiatric consultation was requested by the transplant team after the patient\u2019s family expressed concern that he had recently become increasingly irritable and anxious and seemed to be having difficulty coping with the requirements for transplantation. Mr. Jennings\u2019s primary care physician had recently prescribed alprazolam 0.5 mg as needed for his anxiety. This was initially helpful, but after several days his family noticed he seemed more irritable, lethargic, and forgetful.\n\nWhen interviewed, the patient said that he had been tired for months prior to the diagnosis and that the fatigue had hampered his ability to work (his job required making deliveries for a shipping firm). Although the diagnosis had been a shock, he said he had left the hospital feeling \u201cgreat, better than I\u2019d felt in years.\u201d For about a week after discharge, he described having enhanced energy and a sense of well-being, but he then began to feel anxious and restless. He slept poorly, unable to concentrate, and worried constantly about his health, finances, and family. He became less engaged with his family and stopped watching movies, normally his favorite pastime.\n\nHe denied having nightmares, flashbacks, avoidant behaviors, or racing thoughts. He also denied low mood, tearfulness, appetite changes, anhedonia, helplessness, hopelessness, or suicidality. He reported that he had started drinking daily 10 years earlier, stating that he enjoyed the taste of beer and liked socializing with friends after work. He developed tolerance to alcohol, needing to consume six to eight drinks per night to achieve the same effect. He described some withdrawal symptoms in the morning but did not drink during work hours; he underwent random testing due to his job as a truck driver. He did miss some family activities, preferring to drink, and this had been a source of marital conflict. He admitted feeling guilty about his alcohol use and its impact on him and his family. He denied using any alcohol since his hospitalization. He admitted to anger over having to undergo addiction counseling and had argued with the transplant team about this requirement. He denied having been an anxious person and considered himself able to handle most of life\u2019s challenges without being overwhelmed. His family confirmed his description of himself and viewed his recent behavior as uncharacteristic.\n\nOn mental status examination, Mr. Jennings was a thin, jaundiced, tired-appearing man. His gait was normal, but he was fidgety while seated. He maintained eye contact and responded appropriately, although he repeatedly made comments like, \u201cSomething isn\u2019t right\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s not all in my head.\u201d His affect was anxious and irritable, and his speech was terse. He appeared distracted but denied confusion and disorientation. He had no delusions or hallucinations. His thoughts were logical and coherent, without disorganization, and there was no latency to his responses. He scored 26 out of 30 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, missing points for recall and serial 7s. He scored in the normal range for Trail Making Test A and B but asked to have the instructions repeated for Trails B.",

I need to extract all relevant data systematically.\n\nFirst, the key facts: patient has alcohol use disorder with physiological dependence, now abstinent after hospitalization. He's on prednisolone and recently used alprazolam. The timeline shows initial euphoria post-discharge followed by anxiety, irritability, cognitive changes, and functional decline. Mental status exam reveals anxious\/irritable affect, mild cognitive deficits on MoCA, and subjective distress.\n\nThe primary consideration must be substance\/medication-induced disorders given the clear temporal relationship with medications and alcohol withdrawal. The initial \"high\" after discharge could suggest steroid-induced mood changes, while subsequent anxiety and cognitive issues align with benzodiazepine use and potential withdrawal. The cognitive deficits on testing are concerning but not severe enough for major neurocognitive disorder yet.\n\nFor differential diagnosis, adjustment disorder seems less likely given the severity and pattern of symptoms. Generalized anxiety disorder is questionable since he denies being an anxious person historically. The absence of mood symptoms rules out depressive disorders. Cognitive symptoms warrant consideration of mild neurocognitive disorder but need to rule out reversible causes first.\n\nThe patient's anger about transplant requirements and recent behavioral changes could indicate adjustment issues, but the medication effects seem more prominent.

    "vignette":"Peter Winters, a 46-year-old married white minister, was referred to the psychiatry outpatient department by his primary care doctor for depressive symptoms and opioid misuse in the setting of chronic right knee pain.\n\nMr. Winters injured his right knee playing basketball 17 months earlier. His mother gave him several tablets of hydrocodone-acetaminophen that she had for back pain, and he found this helpful. When he ran out of the pills and his pain persisted, he went to the emergency room. He was told he had a mild sprain. He was given a 1-month supply of hydrocodone-acetaminophen. He took the pills as prescribed for 1 month, and his pain resolved.\n\nAfter stopping the pills, however, Mr. Winters began to experience a recurrence of the pain in his knee. He saw an orthopedist, who ordered imaging studies and determined that there was no structural damage. Mr. Winters was given another 1-month supply of hydrocodone-acetaminophen. This time, however, he needed to take more than prescribed in order to ease the pain. He also felt dysphoric and \u201cachy\u201d when he abstained from taking the medication, and described a \u201ccraving\u201d for more opioids. He returned to the orthopedist, who referred him to a pain specialist.\n\nMr. Winters was too embarrassed to go to the pain specialist, believing that his faith and strength should help him overcome the pain. He found it impossible to live without the pain medication, however, because of the pain, dysphoria, and muscle aches when he stopped the medication. He also began to \u201cenjoy the high\u201d and experienced intense craving. He began to frequent emergency rooms to receive more opioids, often lying about the timing and nature of his right knee pain, and even stole pills from his mother on two occasions. He became preoccupied with trying to find more opioids, and his work and home life suffered. He endorsed low mood, especially when contemplating the impact of opioids on his life, but denied any other mood or neurovegetative symptoms. Eventually, he told his primary care doctor about his opioid use and low mood, and that doctor referred him to the outpatient psychiatry clinic.\n\nMr. Winters had a history of two lifetime major depressive episodes that were treated successfully with escitalopram by his primary care doctor. He also had a history of an alcohol use disorder when he was in his 20s. He managed to quit using alcohol on his own after a family intervention. He smoked two packs of cigarettes daily. His father suffered from depression, and \u201calmost everyone\u201d on his mother\u2019s side of the family had \u201cissues with addiction.\u201d He had been married to his wife for 20 years, and they had two school-age children. He had been a minister in his church for 15 years. Results of a recent physical examination and laboratory testing performed by his primary care physician had been within normal limits.\n\nOn mental status examination, Mr. Winters was cooperative and did not exhibit any psychomotor abnormalities. He answered most questions briefly, often simply saying \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d Speech was of a normal rate and tone, without tangentiality or circumstantiality. He reported that his mood was \u201clousy,\u201d and his affect was dysphoric and constricted. He denied symptoms of paranoia or hallucinations. He denied any thoughts of harming himself or others.

    "vignette":"The patient is an 18-year-old non-binary college freshman with a complex psychiatric presentation. They report a history of childhood anxiety, perfectionism, and ritualistic self-punishment behaviors starting in the third grade. Currently, their most debilitating symptom is anxiety about \"contaminated air\" when others cough or sneeze, prompting them to cover their face and hold their breath even when the trigger is far away or on television. They engage in checking and counting behaviors based on the number 3, including checking mirrors while driving, locking\/unlocking their car, and tapping their toothbrush. These compulsions are experienced as uncontrollable, with the patient reporting they sometimes modify behaviors (like holding an imaginary door handle in their pocket) when the original compulsion would be disruptive. At approximately age 16, the patient developed anorexia nervosa, restricting their food intake and ultimately requiring intervention from parents and a treatment team. Despite gaining weight under external pressure, the patient continues to restrict eating, has a distinct fear of gaining weight, becoming fat, fasting until dinner, drinking coffee to intentionally upset their stomach. Their BMI currently falls within the normal range. Around the same time their eating disorder developed, the patient experienced depressive symptoms including hopelessness, low motivation, and self-harm behaviors (pulling hair, cutting, punching stomach). They had suicidal ideation during high school, including thoughts of jumping in front of a train and fantasizing about wandering into hallways during a school shooting. Current suicidal thoughts are less frequent and persistent. Current depressive symptoms have been subsyndromal (though not entirely absent) for about 7 months. Specifically, the patient currently denies experiencing depressive symptoms for more than a few hours every couple of weeks but rates their chance of self-harm in the next three months at 50% (suicide attempt chance at 0%). They report minimal alcohol and marijuana use. Notably, the patient expresses resistance to treatment, stating that \"getting better means getting fat\" and feeling they need to \"stay sad for a while longer\".",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the vignette about Barbara Reiss. She's a 51-year-old woman brought to the ER due to suicidal thoughts. The symptoms started about four months ago with daily depression, worsening over time. She has significant weight loss without trying, insomnia with early morning awakening, low energy, poor concentration, and guilt over a perceived mistake at work. \n\nHmm, the key features here are the persistent depressed mood, anhedonia (losing interest in life), weight loss, insomnia, fatigue, and impaired concentration. That strongly points to a major depressive episode. But there's more\u2014she's convinced she caused deaths at work and fears arrest, which sounds like a delusion of guilt. Even though she insists it's true, the context makes it seem unrealistic.\n\nLet me check if this meets criteria for a major depressive episode. DSM-5-TR requires five symptoms over two weeks, including depressed mood or anhedonia. She has both, plus weight loss, sleep disturbance, fatigue, and diminished ability to think. That's at least five, so major depressive disorder (MDD) is likely. But the delusion about causing deaths suggests psychotic features. Since the delusion is mood-congruent (related to guilt), it would be MDD with psychotic features.\n\nWait, could this be something else? She has no prior psychiatric history, no manic episodes, and no substance use besides minimal alcohol. Her sister has depression, so there's a family history. The physical exam and labs were normal, ruling out medical causes. The onset is in her 50s, which is typical for MDD, though earlier onset is more common.\n\nWhat about other diagnoses? She has suicidal ideation, which is severe. Could it be bipolar depression? She denies mania, but sometimes it's missed. However, no history of elevated mood, increased energy, or decreased need for sleep. So, bipolar is less likely but should be considered.\n\nAnxiety disorders? She's agitated and worried, but the core issue is depression. No panic attacks or specific phobias mentioned. Adjustment disorder? The symptoms are severe and persistent beyond what's expected for a stressor. Plus, the delusion pushes it towards a more serious condition.\n\nSchizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder? She has a delusion but no other psychotic symptoms like hallucinations. The mood symptoms are prominent and preceded the psychosis, so schizoaffective is possible but less likely. MDD with psychotic features fits better.\n\nSubstance-induced? She drinks a glass of wine, sometimes two, but that's minimal. No illicit drugs. So, substance-induced mood disorder is unlikely.\n\nPersonality disorder? No chronic pattern mentioned; the onset is recent, so probably not.\n\nSo, primary diagnosis is Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, severe with psychotic features. But wait, the vignette says symptoms started four months ago and worsened. Is this a single episode or recurrent? It doesn't mention past episodes, so single episode is appropriate.\n\nNow, for secondary diagnoses. What else could be considered? \n\n1. MDD with psychotic features as primary. \n2. Bipolar disorder, current episode depressed with psychotic features\u2014less likely but possible if hypomania was missed.\n3. Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type\u2014since psychosis is present without mood symptoms being episodic? But here mood and psychosis are concurrent.\n4. Delusional disorder\u2014but the delusion is mood-congruent, and depression is prominent.\n5. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood\u2014but the severity and psychosis make MDD more likely.\n\nI need to list the top five with ICD-10 codes. \n\nPrimary: Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, severe with psychotic features (F32.3). \n\nSecondary: \n- Bipolar disorder, current episode depressed with psychotic features (F31.5).\n- Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type (F25.1).\n- Delusional disorder (F22).\n- Adjustment disorder with depressed mood (F43.21).\n\nBut I should ensure these are plausible. Also, rule out medical conditions, but since labs are normal, no need to include non-psychiatric diagnoses.\n\nWait, the vignette mentions she started drinking more to sleep. Could alcohol use disorder be considered? She drinks two glasses max, no criteria for AUD, so probably not.\n\nAnxiety disorders? Not prominent enough.\n\nSo, the list seems reasonable. Let me double-check the codes.\n\nF32.3 for severe MDD with psychotic features. \nF31.5 for bipolar depressive with psychotic.\nF25.1 for schizoaffective depressive.\nF22 for delusional.\nF43.21 for adjustment with depressed mood.\n\nYes, that covers the main possibilities based on the symptoms presented.",

    "model_thoughts":"First, I need to read the clinical case vignette carefully and extract all relevant information. The vignette is about Patient H, a 36-year-old female with a history of major depressive disorder (MDD). She presents to an inpatient psychiatric hospital for bizarre behavior. Key points:\n\n- History: Diagnosed with MDD at age 20, on Zoloft for years, but lost insurance and hasn't taken Zoloft for 6 months.\n\n- Presenting issues: Bizarre behavior noticed by mother \u2013 not eating, staring blankly at walls, not attending to hygiene.\n\n- Social history: Previously worked full-time as an accountant, married with 2 children.\n\n- Mental status exam findings:\n  - Mute (does not speak).\n  - Poor hygiene.\n  - Facial grimacing (face scrunches during interview).\n  - Sits motionless, not answering questions.\n  - Stares blankly, unable to engage.\n  - Does not follow simple commands (e.g., stick tongue out).\n  - Neurological-like findings: On musculoskeletal exam, when her arm is moved, there's initial large resistance that slowly decreases (this sounds like gegenhalten or oppositional rigidity, which is a form of negativism or catatonia). Then, when her arm is moved above her head and let go, she leaves it there (this is waxy flexibility or catalepsy, indicative of catatonia).\n\nFrom this, I need to organize the data logically. The patient has a history of MDD but is now off medication for 6 months. The current presentation includes mutism, negativism, stereotypies (facial grimacing), stupor (motionless, staring), and catalepsy (arm remains in position). These are classic signs of catatonia.\n\nCatatonia is a syndrome that can occur in various psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, mood disorders, or other conditions. Given her history of MDD, catatonic features could be part of a severe depressive episode with catatonic features. Alternatively, it could be due to other causes like schizophrenia or medical conditions, but the vignette doesn't mention psychotic symptoms outside of catatonia.\n\nNow, for diagnostic reasoning: The primary issue is catatonia. I need to consider DSM-5-TR diagnoses. Catatonia can be specified as part of another mental disorder or as catatonic disorder due to another medical condition, or unspecified catatonia.\n\nKey features: History of MDD, off meds, presenting with catatonic symptoms. The catatonic symptoms are prominent: mutism, negativism (resistance to movement), stereotypy (facial grimacing), stupor, and catalepsy.\n\nIn DSM-5-TR, catatonia can be diagnosed as:\n- Catatonia associated with another mental disorder (e.g., major depressive disorder with catatonic features).\n- Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition.\n- Unspecified catatonia.\n\nSince she has a history of MDD and is off medication, it's likely a relapse or exacerbation of her depressive disorder with catatonic features. Alternatively, given the abrupt onset after stopping medication, it could be related to withdrawal or something else, but the vignette doesn't indicate substance use or medical issues.\n\nI should also consider schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders, but there's no mention of delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. The bizarre behavior might imply psychosis, but the specific symptoms described are catatonic, not typical positive symptoms of psychosis.\n\nAnother possibility: Schizophreniaform disorder or brief psychotic disorder, but with a history of MDD, mood disorder with psychotic features is more likely.\n\nAlso, given the catatonic symptoms, I need to rule out medical causes, but the vignette doesn't provide medical history, so I'll stick to psychiatric diagnoses based on the information.\n\nFor the differential diagnosis, I need to list the top 5 most likely diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes.\n\nPrimary diagnosis: Major depressive disorder, single episode or recurrent, with catatonic features. Since she was diagnosed at 20 and has been on meds, it's likely recurrent. But the vignette says \"history of MDD,\" so I'll use recurrent. ICD-10 code for Major depressive disorder, recurrent, with catatonic features is F33.3.\n\nBut in DSM-5-TR, catatonic features can be specified for major depressive disorder. ICD-10 has specific codes for depressive episode with catatonic features: F32.3 for single episode, F33.3 for recurrent.\n\nGiven her age and history, recurrent is probable.\n\nSecondary diagnoses: I need four others.\n\n1. Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition \u2013 but no medical condition mentioned, so less likely, but I should include it as a rule-out.\n\n2. Schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder \u2013 but no clear psychotic symptoms outside catatonia, and history of MDD suggests mood disorder.\n\n3. Brief psychotic disorder \u2013 if symptoms are acute, but catatonia is prominent.\n\n4. Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder \u2013 if catatonia is primary without other psychosis.\n\n5. Unspecified catatonia \u2013 if we can't attribute it to a mood disorder.\n\nBut since she has a history of MDD, mood disorder is primary.\n\nLet's list plausible diagnoses:\n\n- Primary: Major depressive disorder, recurrent, with catatonic features (F33.3)\n\nSecondary possibilities:\n\n- Schizophrenia, catatonic type (F20.2) \u2013 but no prior history of schizophrenia, and onset might be late, but possible.\n\n- Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type (F25.1) \u2013 if mood and psychotic symptoms are both prominent, but here catatonia might be the psychotic feature.\n\n- Catatonic disorder not otherwise specified or unspecified (F06.1 or F06.8? In ICD-10, catatonic disorder due to brain disease is F06.1, but for psychiatric catatonia, it might be F44.2 for dissociative stupor or F20.2 for schizophrenia. Actually, in ICD-10, catatonia is often coded under the primary disorder.\n\nICD-10 codes for catatonia in other disorders: For depression, as above. For schizophrenia, F20.2 catatonic schizophrenia. For catatonic disorder due to medical condition, F06.1. For other catatonia, F06.1 or F44.2? Let's check DSM-5-TR correspondence.\n\nIn DSM-5-TR, catatonia can be coded as:\n- With another mental disorder: use the code for that disorder with specifier.\n- Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition: code first the medical condition, then F06.1.\n- Unspecified catatonia: F06.1.\n\nFor ICD-10, I need to use F-codes.\n\nStandard ICD-10 codes:\n- F33.3: Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe with psychotic symptoms (but with catatonic features, it might be specified, but ICD-10 doesn't have a separate code for catatonic features; it's under severe with psychotic symptoms if catatonia is considered psychotic? Catatonia is a psychomotor disturbance, not necessarily psychotic. In ICD-10, for depressive episode with catatonic features, it's F32.3 or F33.3 for severe with psychotic symptoms, but catatonic features are specified in the criteria.\n\nLooking up: In ICD-10, catatonic schizophrenia is F20.2, and for mood disorders with catatonic features, it's coded under the mood disorder with specification.\n\nFor major depressive disorder with catatonic features, ICD-10 code is F33.3 if recurrent severe with psychotic features, but catatonia might be considered a specifier.\n\nTo be precise, I'll use:\n- For major depressive disorder with catatonic features: F33.3 (since it's severe and likely with psychotic features due to catatonia).\n\nNow, for secondary diagnoses:\n\n1. Schizophrenia, catatonic type (F20.2) \u2013 possible if this is a first psychotic break with catatonia, but history of MDD suggests mood disorder.\n\n2. Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type (F25.1) \u2013 if both mood and psychotic symptoms are present.\n\n3. Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition (F06.1) \u2013 to consider medical causes.\n\n4. Unspecified catatonia (F06.1) \u2013 if we can't determine the underlying cause.\n\n5. Other specified schizophrenia spectrum disorder (F28) \u2013 for catatonia without full schizophrenia.\n\nBut I need to prioritize based on likelihood.\n\nGiven the history of MDD and cessation of medication, relapse of depression with catatonic features is most likely.\n\nAlso, consider that stopping Zoloft abruptly could lead to discontinuation syndrome or relapse, but not typically catatonia; catatonia is more severe.\n\nAnother thought: Could this be a manic episode with catatonic features? But no symptoms of mania mentioned; she has depressive symptoms like not eating, poor hygiene, which could be depressive.\n\nThe vignette says \"bizarre behavior\" and catatonic symptoms, so psychosis might be implied.\n\nIn DSM-5, catatonia can be present in bipolar disorder or major depression.\n\nFor the list, I'll go with:\n\nPrimary: Major depressive disorder, recurrent, with catatonic features - F33.3\n\nThen secondary:\n\n2. Schizophrenia, catatonic type - F20.2 (as a differential)\n\n3. Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type - F25.1\n\n4. Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition - F06.1\n\n5. Unspecified catatonia - F06.1 (but F06.1 is for catatonic disorder due to brain disease, so for unspecified, it might be F06.1 or F44.2? Actually, in ICD-10, other catatonic states are under F06.1 or F44.2 for dissociative disorders. But for psychiatric use, F06.1 is for organic catatonic disorder, so for non-organic, it might be under schizophrenia or mood disorders.\n\nTo align with DSM-5-TR, for unspecified catatonia, ICD-10 code is F06.1 if due to a medical condition, but for psychiatric catatonia NOS, it might be F29 for unspecified nonorganic psychosis? This is confusing.\n\nLet's simplify: Use common codes.\n\nFor major depressive disorder with catatonic features: F33.3\n\nFor catatonic schizophrenia: F20.2\n\nFor schizoaffective disorder: F25.1\n\nFor catatonic disorder due to medical condition: F06.1\n\nFor brief psychotic disorder with catatonia: F23\n\nBut brief psychotic disorder might be F23.\n\nSince the patient has a history of MDD, I think mood disorder is primary.\n\nAlso, note that the patient is mute and has waxy flexibility, which is classic for catatonia.\n\nNow, for the response, I need to output only the structured list, no clinical reasoning.\n\nFormat:\n1. <Primary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n2. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n3. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n4. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n5. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n\nPrimary: Major depressive disorder, recurrent, with catatonic features - F33.3\n\nSecondary: I'll list other possible diagnoses in order of likelihood or as differentials.\n\nFrom most to least likely based on the vignette:\n\n1. Major depressive disorder with catatonic features (primary)\n\n2. Schizophrenia, catatonic type (since catatonia is prominent and no clear mood episode described beyond history)\n\n3. Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type (combining mood and psychosis)\n\n4. Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition (rule out)\n\n5. Brief psychotic disorder with catatonic features (if acute onset)\n\nBut the vignette says she has a history of MDD, so mood disorder is pre-existing.\n\nAnother idea: Since she stopped Zoloft, could this be serotonin discontinuation syndrome? Unlikely to cause catatonia.\n\nOr withdrawal from SSRIs might precipitate catatonia in rare cases, but not typical.\n\nI think F33.3 is appropriate for primary.\n\nFor secondary, let's define:\n\n- Schizophrenia, catatonic type (F20.2): because catatonic symptoms are primary, and she has bizarre behavior, mutism, etc., which could be part of schizophrenia.\n\n- Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type (F25.1): if we consider the MDD history and current catatonia as psychotic features.\n\n- Catatonic disorder not otherwise specified (F06.1): for unspecified catatonia.\n\n- Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder (F28): for catatonia without full criteria.\n\nBut in terms of ICD-10 codes, I need to use valid F-codes.\n\nLook up ICD-10 codes:\n- F20.2: Catatonic schizophrenia\n- F25.1: Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type\n- F06.1: Organic catatonic disorder\n- F44.2: Dissociative stupor (which might mimic catatonia)\n- F29: Unspecified nonorganic psychosis\n\nFor major depressive disorder with catatonic features, if it's severe with psychotic features, F33.3 is correct.\n\nIn ICD-10, for a severe depressive episode with psychotic symptoms, it's F32.3 or F33.3.\n\nNow, based on the vignette, she has catatonia, which is a psychomotor disturbance, and in the context of depression, it should be coded as severe with psychotic features if catatonia is considered a psychotic feature, but in DSM, catatonic features are a specifier.\n\nI think for simplicity, I'll use F33.3.\n\nFor the list, I'll proceed.\n\nFinal list:\n1. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, with catatonic features - F33.3\n2. Schizophrenia, catatonic type - F20.2\n3. Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type - F25.1\n4. Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition - F06.1\n5. Unspecified catatonia - F06.1\n\nBut F06.1 is used twice; for unspecified catatonia, in ICD-10, it might be F06.1 for other catatonic disorders, or for non-organic, perhaps F44.2. Let's check: In ICD-10, catatonic schizophrenia is F20.2, and for catatonia not otherwise specified, it is often coded under F06.1 if organic, but for psychiatric, it could be F29.\n\nTo avoid repetition, I can use different codes.\n\nPerhaps for catatonic disorder NOS, use F06.1, and for due to medical condition, use F06.1 as well, but that's the same code. In practice, if due to medical condition, it's F06.1 with the medical condition coded separately.\n\nBut for this list, since I'm only giving F-codes, I can list F06.1 for both, but that might be confusing.\n\nI should list distinct diagnoses.\n\nLet's adjust secondary diagnoses:\n\n2. Schizophrenia, catatonic type - F20.2\n3. Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type - F25.1\n4. Brief psychotic disorder with catatonic features - F23\n5. Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder - F28\n\nF23 is for acute and transient psychotic disorders, which could fit if this is a first acute episode.\n\nBut with history of MDD, it might not be brief psychotic disorder.\n\nI think the primary is clear, and for secondary, I'll include other catatonia-related disorders.\n\nAnother possibility: Mood disorder with psychotic features, but catatonia is already included.\n\nI'll go with the list above.\n\nTo confirm, in the vignette, there's no mention of medical issues, so catatonic disorder due to another medical condition is a rule-out but less likely.\n\nAnd unspecified catatonia is if we can't attribute it to a specific disorder.\n\nSo, for the response:\n\n1. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, with catatonic features - F33.3\n2. Schizophrenia, catatonic type - F20.2\n3. Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type - F25.1\n4. Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition - F06.1\n5. Unspecified catatonia - F06.1\n\nBut for unspecified catatonia, in ICD-10, the code might be F06.1 for other catatonic disorders, or F44.2 for dissociative stupor. Since the patient has catatonia with waxy flexibility, it's not dissociative, so F06.1 is better.\n\nIn DSM-5-TR, for catatonia not elsewhere classified, it's coded as F06.1.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to provide only the list, no reasoning.\n\nSo, final answer.",

    "vignette":"Nadine was a 15-year-old girl whose mother brought her for a psychiatric evaluation to help with her long-standing shyness.\n\nAlthough Nadine was initially reluctant to say much about herself, she said she felt constantly tense. She added that the anxiety had been \u201creally bad\u201d for several years and was often accompanied by episodes of dizziness and crying. She was generally unable to speak in any situation outside of her home or school classes. She refused to leave her house alone for fear of being forced to interact with someone. She was especially anxious around other teenagers, but she had also become \u201ctoo nervous\u201d to speak to adult neighbors she had known for years. She said it felt impossible to walk into a restaurant and order from \u201ca stranger at the counter\u201d for fear of being humiliated. She also felt constantly on her guard, needing to avoid the possibility of getting attacked, a strategy that really only worked when she was alone in her home.\n\nNadine tried to conceal her crippling anxiety from her parents, typically telling them that she \u201cjust didn\u2019t feel like\u201d going out. Feeling trapped and incompetent, Nadine said she contemplated suicide \u201call the time.\u201d In the month before her mother finally brought her in for a psychiatric evaluation, Nadine had begun to cut herself on her thighs to \u201cfeel pain and relieve stress.\u201d No one in the family was aware of this development.\n\nNadine had always been \u201cshy\u201d and had been teased at recess since she started kindergarten. The teasing had escalated to outright bullying by the time she was in seventh grade. The bullying took on a cultural\/racially motivated undertone; Nadine and her family were of a different ethnicity than the vast majority of her schoolmates. For 2 years, day after difficult day, Nadine\u2019s peers turned on her \u201clike a snarling wolf pack,\u201d calling her \u201cstupid,\u201d \u201cugly,\u201d and \u201ccrazy.\u201d Not infrequently, one of them would stare at her and tell her she would be better off committing suicide. One girl (the ringleader, as well as a former elementary school chum) hit Nadine on one occasion, giving her a black eye. Nadine did not fight back. This event was witnessed by an adult neighbor, who told Nadine\u2019s mother. When Nadine\u2019s mother asked her about the incident, Nadine denied it, saying she had \u201cfallen\u201d on the street. She did, however, mention to her mother \u201cin passing\u201d that she wanted to switch schools, but her delivery was so offhand that at the time, her mother casually advised against the switch. Nadine suffered on, sobbing herself to sleep most nights and wishing that she would not wake up.\n\nFull of hope and ideas of escape from the bullies and their narrowness, Nadine transferred to a specialty arts high school for ninth grade. Although the bullying ceased, her anxiety symptoms paradoxically worsened. She felt even more unable to venture into public spaces and felt increasingly embarrassed by her inability to develop the sort of independence typical of a 15-year-old. She said she had begun to spend whole weekends \u201ctrapped\u201d in her home and had become scared to even read by herself in the local park. Nadine\u2019s social anxiety had evolved into true agoraphobia. She had nightly nightmares about the bullies in her old school. Her preoccupation with suicide grew.\n\nHer parents had thought she would outgrow being shy and sought psychiatric help for her only after a teacher remarked that her anxiety and social isolation were keeping her from making the sort of grades and doing the sort of extracurricular activities that were necessary to get into a good college.\n\nNadine described her mother as loud, excitable, aggressive, and \u201ca little frightening.\u201d Her father was a successful tax attorney who worked long hours. Nadine described him as shy in social situations (\u201cHe\u2019s more like me\u201d). Nadine said she and her father sometimes joked that the goal of any evening was to avoid tipping the mother into a rage. Nadine added that she \u201cnever wanted to be anything like her mother.\u201d",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, the user provided a clinical case vignette and wants me to diagnose it following the DSM-5-TR criteria. I need to extract key symptoms and organize them logically to support the diagnostic reasoning. Let me start by carefully reading the vignette again.\n\nNadine is 15, with long-standing shyness, but now presents with intense anxiety. She has constant tension, dizziness, crying spells, and an inability to speak outside home or school. She avoids leaving home alone, fears interaction, especially with peers and even familiar adults. There's mention of feeling on guard and avoiding potential attacks, which only eases when she's home alone. \n\nShe's hiding her anxiety from parents, has suicidal ideation \"all the time,\" and recent self-harm by cutting. There's a history of bullying with racial undertones, physical assault, and worsening symptoms after transferring schools. Despite the bullying stopping, her anxiety escalated into agoraphobia, nightmares, and increased suicidal thoughts. Family dynamics include a mother described as aggressive and a father who's shy, with Nadine identifying more with him.\n\nKey symptoms: Social anxiety, agoraphobia, persistent suicidal ideation, self-harm, nightmares related to past trauma. The bullying and racial harassment might point to trauma-related issues. The worsening after escaping the bullying suggests that the trauma persisted despite removal from the environment.\n\nDifferential diagnosis considerations: Social Anxiety Disorder seems primary due to fear of humiliation and avoidance. Agoraphobia is comorbid as she fears public spaces. Persistent Depressive Disorder might be present given chronic low mood and hopelessness. PTSD from bullying, especially with nightmares and avoidance. Adjustment Disorder could be considered but symptoms are chronic and severe. Also, Major Depressive Disorder given suicidal ideation, but the chronicity might lean towards persistent depressive disorder. Non-suicidal self-injury is evident from cutting.\n\nNeed to prioritize based on DSM-5-TR. Social Anxiety Disorder is the main issue affecting functioning. Agoraphobia often co-occurs. PTSD due to prolonged bullying and trauma symptoms. Persistent Depressive Disorder given chronic nature. Self-harm as a separate concern but part of broader emotional dysregulation.

Bulimia nervosa is less likely without binge episodes described.

Her husband stated that she had been behaving very strangely and that she had become convinced that she had smothered and killed her baby.\n\nHer husband reported that after a normal pregnancy and uncomplicated delivery, Ms. Norman had happily gone home with their first child. On the third day after delivery, however, her mood and affect began to shift rapidly between elation and weepiness. She became irritable and anxious. She slept only an hour a night, even when her baby was asleep. Her behavior became increasingly bizarre, with overactivity and agitation. Her speech was rapid and digressive. Although not previously a religious person, she became convinced that God was speaking through her and that she had special powers that could solve the problems of the world. She told her husband that she could identify evil people by looking into their eyes and had begun to worry that she was surrounded by evil people, including her own mother. Most disturbing for her, whenever she was out of sight of her son, she became totally convinced that she had smothered him, and no one could convince her otherwise.\n\nMs. Norman had a history of three episodes of major depressive disorder in her teens and early 20s. These episodes resolved with psychotherapy and antidepressant medication. She also had a psychiatric admission for mania 3 years prior to the delivery of her child, after a flight from Asia to Europe. Following treatment with antipsychotic medication, she became depressed for several months. Although a diagnosis of bipolar disorder was discussed at this time, she was reluctant to accept this label, attributing the episode to stress and jet lag. She had discontinued the psychiatric medication in anticipation of getting pregnant.\n\nMs. Norman\u2019s own mother had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital shortly after the birth of her first child. This episode was not talked about in the family, and there were few other details. She had no other family history of note.\n\nUntil just before delivery of her child, Ms. Norman had been a highly functional nurse in a renal unit. Her husband was the head of a sales team, and they lived in comfortable social circumstances. She had no history of illicit drug use and, prior to pregnancy, drank only 2 or 3 units of alcohol a week.\n\nOn mental status examination, Ms. Norman wandered around the room, seemingly unable to sit for more than a few moments. She was distractible and overtalkative, and demonstrated flight of ideas, flitting from one subject to another. Her mood was labile. At times she appeared happily euphoric. At other times she was tearful, and she could become quickly irritable when she felt she was not being understood. It was clear that she had a number of delusional beliefs but was unwilling to discuss most of them with the examiner. She did insist that she had already killed her own child, which led to several minutes of tears, but she returned to an edgy euphoria within a few minutes. She denied intent to harm herself or anyone else. She appeared inattentive, with poor concentration, but would not participate in formal cognitive testing.\n\nPhysical examination and laboratory testing results were all within normal limits.",

Need to extract key clinical features systematically.\n\nOkay, the onset is clearly timed to postpartum period - symptoms began on day 3 after delivery. There's rapid mood cycling between elation and weepiness, decreased need for sleep, irritability, anxiety, overactivity, agitation, pressured speech, grandiose delusions about special powers, paranoid ideation about evil people, and a particularly distressing delusion about harming her infant. The history reveals previous major depressive episodes and one prior manic episode that was treated but not formally diagnosed as bipolar. There's also family history of postpartum psychiatric hospitalization in her mother.\n\nThe mental status exam shows psychomotor agitation, distractibility, pressured speech, flight of ideas, labile mood, delusional thinking, and poor concentration. Physical workup is normal, ruling out organic causes.\n\nConsidering the acute postpartum onset with psychotic features, mood lability, and prior history of mania, this strongly points toward bipolar disorder with peripartum onset.

Postpartum psychosis with mood features is important, though technically this would fall under bipolar in DSM-5. Brief psychotic disorder is possible but less likely given prior manic history.

He would be confused for a few minutes after gaining consciousness, complain of headaches, and would sleep at times.

Switching to levetiracetam (LEV) resolved the drowsiness, but on the second day, he developed psychotic symptoms like delusions and auditory hallucinations, along with agitation and restlessness.\n\nHmm, the key here is the temporal relationship between starting levetiracetam and the onset of psychiatric symptoms. Levetiracetam is known to sometimes cause psychiatric side effects, including psychosis, agitation, and hallucinations. The patient had no prior psychiatric history, which makes a substance-induced psychosis more likely given the timing. Also, the BPRS score of 34 with elevated suspiciousness and hostility points to an acute psychotic episode.\n\nBut I need to consider other possibilities. Could this be a primary psychotic disorder like schizophrenia? The patient is 16, which is within the typical onset range, but the abrupt onset right after medication change and lack of prodromal symptoms make it less likely. Schizoaffective disorder or brief psychotic disorder are also possibilities, but again, the direct link to levetiracetam initiation is strong.\n\nWhat about the seizure disorder itself? Could the psychosis be related to epilepsy, like postictal psychosis or interictal psychosis? Postictal psychosis usually occurs after a cluster of seizures, but here he was seizure-free for six days before the symptoms started. Interictal psychosis is more chronic, which doesn\u2019t fit the acute presentation. So, substance\/medication-induced psychotic disorder seems the most fitting.\n\nAlso, the patient had psychosocial impairments like stopping school and avoiding social situations due to fear of seizures. That might indicate an adjustment disorder or anxiety, but the acute presentation is dominated by psychosis. However, the long-term avoidance behaviors could point to an anxiety disorder secondary to his medical condition.\n\nLet me list out the diagnoses in order of likelihood. Primary diagnosis: Substance\/medication-induced psychotic disorder due to levetiracetam. Secondary diagnoses could include anxiety disorder due to another medical condition (epilepsy), adjustment disorder, and maybe rule out primary psychotic disorders. Oh, and the seizure disorder itself is a neurological condition, so I won\u2019t list it as a psychiatric diagnosis unless there\u2019s a specific psychiatric manifestation.\n\nWait, the vignette mentions fear of seizures leading to school refusal and social avoidance. That sounds like anxiety related to his medical condition, which fits under anxiety disorder due to another medical condition. Also, the psychosocial stressors might contribute to an adjustment disorder. But since the acute issue is psychosis, that takes precedence.\n\nI should also consider whether the valproate toxicity contributed, but the symptoms improved after stopping valproate, and the psychosis started after starting LEV. So, LEV is the likely culprit. \n\nNow, for ICD-10 codes. Substance-induced psychotic disorder would be F06.8. Anxiety disorder due to epilepsy is F06.4. Adjustment disorder with anxiety is F43.23. Schizophrenia or other primary psychoses would be F20.9 or F23, but those are less likely. Maybe include brief psychotic disorder as a rule-out, but given the medication link, it\u2019s lower on the list.\n\nLet me structure the list: primary is medication-induced psychotic disorder, then anxiety due to epilepsy, adjustment disorder, brief psychotic disorder, and schizophrenia as less likely but possible differentials.",

They describe their living situation as \"overwhelming\" due to parental boundary issues, though they maintain a supportive romantic relationship since 2019. Their psychiatric history includes diagnoses of MDD and GAD at age 15-16, PTSD in 2016 following emotional abuse by high school friends, and ADHD in 2018 (without neuropsychological evaluation). Current medications include Lisdexamfetamine 50mg (since 2018), various supplements, and a contraceptive injection. They previously tried multiple antidepressants (2011-2015) but discontinued each after approximately two weeks due to suicidal ideation and, in one case, motor disturbances. The patient consumes alcohol socially (3-5 drinks monthly) and has been vaping marijuana 1-3 times weekly for three months primarily to aid sleep and manage anxiety. The patient's primary symptoms onset around age 5 with intrusive visualizations of falling down stairs along with perfectionism through rewriting notes until they felt \"just right\". Currently, they experience significant distress when surroundings are not in the \"right spot\", spending up to 12 hours reorganizing belongings without breaks, which would cause severe distress if interrupted. This \"not just right\" feeling impairs their ability to meet deadlines, complete job applications, and fulfill social obligations. They also engage in checking behaviors when packing (counting socks repeatedly, checking for essential items) and experience distressing sexual intrusive thoughts. Additionally, the patient exhibits skin-picking behaviors, spending over an hour picking at ingrown hairs until bleeding, scratching their neck and jaw during conversations, and tearing at cuticles, with symptoms worsening during periods of anxiety. They've attempted to stop by wearing pants constantly but have been unsuccessful. The patient has a significant history of depression with three past suicide attempts (overdoses in 2014, 2015, and 2017) and self-injury through cutting (stopped in 2017). They currently experience passive suicidal ideation, anhedonia, decreased appetite, sleep difficulties, psychomotor agitation, feelings of worthlessness, and concentration problems, though they report 0% chance of self-harm in the next three months. Social anxiety manifests as persistent fear of judgment and rejection, with distressing rumination about social interactions and excessive reassurance-seeking that has cost them friendships. The patient also reported past sexual abuse by a boyfriend for 4-5 months but denied PTSD symptoms. They disclosed a history of binge eating episodes. During the binge, they ate more rapidly than normal and felt disgusted and embarrassed after. After these eating binges, pt fasted for ~3 days. These eating binges occurred <1 time per week, and the patient has not engaged in these behaviors in the past 2 months.",

Let me carefully extract and organize the key information first.\n\nThe patient presents with longstanding obsessive-compulsive symptoms starting from age 5, including intrusive visualizations, perfectionism, \"not just right\" feelings, extensive reorganizing behaviors, checking rituals, and distressing sexual intrusive thoughts. These significantly impair daily functioning. There are also prominent body-focused repetitive behaviors like skin-picking that cause bleeding and attempts to stop unsuccessfully.\n\nThere's a clear history of recurrent depression with past suicide attempts and current depressive symptoms including passive SI, anhedonia, sleep\/appetite issues, worthlessness, and concentration problems. Social anxiety features are present with fear of judgment and rumination. There's also a history of binge eating episodes with compensatory fasting, though currently in remission for 2 months.\n\nPast diagnoses include MDD, GAD, PTSD, and ADHD. The substance use appears minimal and not meeting substance use disorder criteria. The trauma history is notable but patient denies current PTSD symptoms.\n\nFor differential diagnosis, the primary issue appears to be obsessive-compulsive disorder given the early onset, clear obsessions and compulsions, time consumption, and distress when prevented from performing rituals. The skin-picking is severe enough to potentially qualify as a separate disorder. Major depression appears to be current and recurrent. Social anxiety disorder is clearly present. The binge eating episodes with fasting suggest bulimia nervosa though frequency may be borderline.\n\nNeed to prioritize based on severity and diagnostic criteria. OCD seems most prominent and impairing. The depressive episode appears to meet criteria for major depression. Social anxiety is clearly described. Excoriation disorder seems distinct from OCD compulsions. Bulimia nervosa should be included given the described behaviors despite recent remission.",

    "vignette":"Felicia Allen was a 32-year-old single woman brought to the emergency room (ER) by police after she apparently tried to steal a city bus in Chicago. Because she appeared to be an \u201cemotionally disturbed person,\u201d a psychiatry consultation was requested.\n\nAccording to the police report, Ms. Allen threatened the driver with a knife, took control of the almost empty city bus, and crashed it. A more complete story was elicited from a friend of Ms. Allen\u2019s who had been on the bus but who had not been arrested. According to her, they had boarded the bus on their way to a nearby shopping mall. Ms. Allen became frustrated when the driver refused her dollar bills, instead demanding exact change. She looked in her purse, but instead of finding exact change, she pulled out a kitchen knife that she carried for protection. The driver fled, so she got into the empty seat and drove the bus across the street into a nearby parked car.\n\nOn examination, Ms. Allen was a handcuffed, heavyset young woman with a bandage on her forehead. She fidgeted and rocked back and forth in her chair. She appeared to be mumbling to herself. When asked what she was saying, the patient made momentary eye contact and just repeated, \u201cSorry, sorry.\u201d She did not respond to other questions.\n\nMore information was elicited from a psychiatrist who had come to the ER soon after the accident. He said that Ms. Allen and her friend were longtime residents at the state psychiatric hospital where he worked. They had just begun to take passes every week as part of an effort toward social remediation; it had been Ms. Allen\u2019s first bus ride without a staff member.\n\nAccording to the psychiatrist, Ms. Allen had received a diagnosis of \u201cchildhood-onset, treatment-resistant paranoid schizophrenia.\u201d She had started hearing voices by age 5 years. Big, strong, intrusive, and psychotic, she had been hospitalized almost constantly since age 11. Her auditory hallucinations generally consisted of a critical voice commenting on her behavior. Her thinking was concrete, but when relaxed she could be self-reflective. She was motivated to please and recurrently said her biggest goal was to \u201chave my own room in my own house with my own friends.\u201d The psychiatrist said that he was not sure what had caused her to pull out the knife. She had not been hallucinating lately and had been feeling less paranoid, but he wondered if she had been more psychotic than she had let on. It was possible that she was just impatient and irritated. The psychiatrist also believed that she had spent almost no period of life developing normally and so had very little experience with the real world.\n\nMs. Allen had been taking clozapine for 1 year, with good resolution of her auditory hallucinations. She had gained 35 pounds on the clozapine, but she had less trouble getting out of bed in the morning and was functioning at a higher level. She was hoping to get a job and live more independently, and the bus trip had been intended as a step in that direction. Because of these improvements and goals, she had insisted on continuing to take the clozapine despite the weight gain.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, the user has provided a detailed clinical vignette and wants a structured list of DSM-5-TR diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes. Let me start by extracting key information from the vignette.\n\nFirst, Felicia is a 32-year-old woman with a long history of childhood-onset paranoid schizophrenia, treatment-resistant, on clozapine. She attempted to steal a bus, threatened the driver with a knife, and crashed it. She has auditory hallucinations since age 5, constant hospitalization since 11. Current mental status: mumbling, poor eye contact, repetitive apologies, fidgeting. Psychiatrist mentions she's on clozapine with good response but recent incident might be due to psychosis or poor impulse control. Also, she has limited real-world experience due to chronic institutionalization.\n\nPrimary diagnosis seems straightforward: Paranoid Schizophrenia, given the chronic history, auditory hallucinations, and previous diagnosis. Need to check if it's still active despite clozapine. The incident could be due to residual symptoms or acute exacerbation. \n\nSecondary diagnoses: Treatment-resistant specifier is mentioned, so that's important. Also, she's on clozapine, which implies treatment resistance. Maybe schizophrenia with treatment resistance specifier. \n\nOther possibilities: Could there be a comorbid intellectual disability or neurodevelopmental disorder? She started hearing voices at age 5, concrete thinking, but able to be self-reflective. Maybe borderline intellectual functioning or impaired psychosocial functioning due to chronic illness. \n\nWhat about the incident itself? Could be an acute stress reaction or adjustment disorder due to new environment, but given her history, psychosis is more likely. Rule out substance use? Not mentioned. Personality changes? Chronic schizophrenia might have led to personality alterations, but not specified. \n\nAlso, consider catatonia? She's fidgeting, rocking, mumbling\u2014maybe some catatonic features but not full criteria. \n\nList out: \n1. Paranoid Schizophrenia, treatment-resistant. \n2. Maybe schizoaffective disorder? No mood episodes mentioned, so probably not. \n3. Intellectual disability? Not enough evidence, but impaired functioning. \n4. Anxiety disorder? Not highlighted. \n5. Trauma-related disorder? Possibly due to chronic illness but not specified. \n\nWait, the user wants top 5 diagnoses. So primary is schizophrenia. Secondary could include treatment resistance specifier, then maybe neurodevelopmental disorder, impulse control disorder, and perhaps a stress-induced exacerbation. \n\nCheck ICD-10 codes: F20.0 for paranoid schizophrenia, F20.9 for unspecified if needed. Treatment resistance isn't a separate code but a specifier. Maybe add F21 for schizotypal disorder? No, she has full schizophrenia. F23 for acute psychotic disorder? But chronic. \n\nMaybe secondary diagnoses: \n1. Paranoid Schizophrenia \n2. Schizophrenia with treatment resistance (specifier, but code same as schizophrenia) \nWait, need distinct F-codes. Maybe include other conditions like obsessive-compulsive disorder? Not indicated. \n\nPerhaps: \n1. Paranoid Schizophrenia - F20.0 \n2. Schizophrenia, treatment-resistant (same code but note specifier) \n3. Neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition? Not mentioned. \n4. Intellectual disability? F71 or F72 based on severity, but not specified. Could be F79 unspecified. \n5. Acute stress reaction? F43.0 maybe, given the bus incident was stressful. \n\nBut the vignette emphasizes chronic psychosis, so prioritize that. Also, consider disorganized behavior as part of schizophrenia. Maybe add schizotypal personality disorder? Unlikely as she has full schizophrenia. \n\nAlternatively, include conditions common in schizophrenia: \n- Schizophrenia, paranoid type - F20.0 \n- Schizophrenia, continuous - F20.1? Not specified. \n- Schizoaffective disorder? No mood symptoms. \n- Delusional disorder? But hallucinations present. \n- Brief psychotic disorder? No, chronic. \n\nMaybe secondary diagnoses: \n1. Paranoid Schizophrenia - F20.0 \n2. Intellectual disability, mild - F70 (if concrete thinking indicates low IQ) \n3. Impulse control disorder - F63.9 (due to impulsive bus takeover) \n4. Anxiety disorder unspecified - F41.9 (possible anxiety in new situations) \n5. Other specified schizophrenia spectrum disorder? Not needed. \n\nWait, the psychiatrist mentions she has very little real-world experience, so maybe a neurodevelopmental disorder. But schizophrenia onset at age 5 is early, possibly childhood-onset schizophrenia. \n\nCheck DSM-5: Childhood-onset schizophrenia is same code. Maybe add communication disorder? Not indicated. \n\nList: \n1. Schizophrenia, paranoid type, childhood-onset, treatment-resistant - F20.0 \n2. Intellectual disability, mild (or borderline intellectual functioning) - F79 or F71 \n3. Other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder - F63.8 (for impulsive aggression) \n4. Other specified anxiety disorder - F41.8 (stress from new environment) \n5. Unspecified neurodevelopmental disorder - F89 (if intellectual disability not confirmed) \n\nBut need to base only on vignette. Intellectual disability isn't explicitly stated, but concrete thinking and lifelong impairment might suggest it. However, she is self-reflective when relaxed, so maybe not. \n\nPerhaps: \n1. Schizophrenia, paranoid type - F20.0 \n2. Schizophrenia, treatment-resistant specifier (same code) \n3. Impulse control disorder - F63.9 \n4. Anxiety disorder due to schizophrenia - F41.8 \n5. Developmental disorder of scholastic skills, unspecified? Not applicable. \n\nMaybe: \n1. F20.0 Paranoid Schizophrenia \n2. F23 Acute and transient psychotic disorder? No, chronic. \n3. F60.0 Paranoid personality disorder? No, she has schizophrenia. \n4. F91 Conduct disorder? Not specified. \n\nBetter to stick with schizophrenia as primary, and then conditions that might co-occur or explain behavior. \n\nAfter re-reading: She has chronic schizophrenia with good response to clozapine but recent incident. Possibly residual symptoms or acute exacerbation. No substance use, no mood symptoms. \n\nSo: \n1. Schizophrenia, paranoid type - F20.0 \n2. Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder (for treatment-resistant specifier) but same code. \n3. Unspecified impulse-control disorder - F63.9 \n4. Unspecified anxiety disorder - F41.9 \n5. Borderline intellectual functioning - F79 (if considered) \n\nBut borderline intellectual functioning is in DSM-5 under V codes, not F-code. So maybe intellectual disability, unspecified - F79. \n\nAlternatively, secondary could be: \n1. Schizophrenia - F20.0 \n2. Schizophrenia, continuous - F20.1 \n3. Schizophrenia, treatment-resistant (no separate code) \n4. Impulse control disorder - F63.9 \n5. Reaction to severe stress, unspecified - F43.9 \n\nBut the user wants top 5 diagnoses with F-codes, so need distinct disorders. \n\nMaybe: \n1. Paranoid Schizophrenia - F20.0 \n2. Intellectual disability, mild - F70 (if her concrete thinking and early onset indicate low IQ) \n3. Impulse-control disorder not elsewhere classified - F63.9 \n4. Acute stress reaction - F43.0 (due to the bus incident) \n5. Other specified neurodevelopmental disorder - F89 (for early onset and developmental issues) \n\nBut acute stress reaction might not fit as it's an immediate reaction, and she had psychosis before. \n\nPerhaps: \n1. Schizophrenia, paranoid type - F20.0 \n2. Schizophrenia, childhood-onset - same code \n3. Intellectual disability - F79 unspecified \n4. Disruptive impulse-control disorder - F63.9 \n5. Anxiety disorder unspecified - F41.9 \n\nNeed to ensure each is a valid DSM-5 diagnosis with F-code. Intellectual disability requires deficits in intellectual and adaptive functioning, which might be inferred from her chronic hospitalization and concrete thinking. \n\nFinal list based on vignette: \n- Paranoid Schizophrenia is clear. \n- Treatment resistance is a specifier, not separate diagnosis. \n- Impulsive aggression noted. \n- Anxiety possibly from new situation. \n- Neurodevelopmental issues due to early onset. \n\nSo: \n1. Paranoid Schizophrenia - F20.0 \n2. Unspecified intellectual disability - F79 \n3. Other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder - F63.8 \n4. Other specified anxiety disorder - F41.8 \n5. Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder (for treatment resistance) but same as F20.0, so maybe avoid duplication. \n\nMaybe replace last with adjustment disorder? Not specified. \n\nBetter: \n1. F20.0 Paranoid Schizophrenia \n2. F79 Unspecified intellectual disability \n3. F63.9 Unspecified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder \n4. F41.9 Unspecified anxiety disorder \n5. F89 Unspecified neurodevelopmental disorder \n\nBut unspecified intellectual disability and unspecified neurodevelopmental disorder might overlap. Choose one. \n\nPerhaps: \n1. F20.0 Schizophrenia, paranoid type \n2. F63.9 Impulse control disorder, unspecified \n3. F41.9 Anxiety disorder, unspecified \n4. F79 Unspecified intellectual disability \n5. F99 Mental disorder, not otherwise specified (if needed) but not ideal. \n\nWait, the vignette says \"childhood-onset, treatment-resistant paranoid schizophrenia\" so that's the main. Secondary could be conditions related to the incident or comorbidities. \n\nMaybe: \n1. Schizophrenia, paranoid type, childhood-onset - F20.0 \n2. Schizophrenia, treatment-resistant (specifier) \n3. Impulse-control disorder - F63.9 \n4. Intellectual disability - F79 \n5. Acute stress reaction - F43.0 \n\nBut acute stress reaction might not be accurate as the incident was due to psychosis. \n\nAfter careful thought: \nPrimary: Schizophrenia, paranoid type, with early onset and treatment resistance. \nSecondary diagnoses that are separate: \n- Intellectual disability (based on concrete thinking and lifelong impairment) \n- Impulse control disorder (impulsive aggression with the knife) \n- Anxiety disorder (possible in new situations) \n- Maybe neurodevelopmental disorder due to very early onset. \n\nBut DSM-5 doesn't have separate code for treatment resistance, so it's part of schizophrenia. \n\nList: \n1. Paranoid Schizophrenia - F20.0 \n2. Mild Intellectual Disability - F70 (if inferred) or F79 \n3. Unspecified Impulse-Control Disorder - F63.9 \n4. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder - F41.9 \n5. Unspecified Neurodevelopmental Disorder - F89 \n\nBut need to see if intellectual disability is supported. She has concrete thinking but can be self-reflective, so maybe borderline intellectual functioning, which is Z55.9, not F-code. So maybe not include. \n\nAlternatively, include psychotic disorder due to another medical condition? No evidence. \n\nMaybe: \n1. F20.0 Paranoid Schizophrenia \n2. F63.9 Unspecified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder \n3. F41.9 Unspecified anxiety disorder \n4. F99 Unspecified mental disorder (for residual symptoms) \n5. F23 Acute and transient psychotic disorder? No, chronic. \n\nWait, the incident might be an acute exacerbation, so maybe other specified schizophrenia spectrum disorder for acute episode. But schizophrenia covers it. \n\nPerhaps: \n1. F20.0 Schizophrenia \n2. F60.0 Paranoid personality disorder? Unlikely with schizophrenia. \n3. F91.8 Other conduct disorders? Not specified. \n\nStick with: \n1. Schizophrenia, paranoid type - F20.0 \n2. Impulse-control disorder, unspecified - F63.9 \n3. Anxiety disorder, unspecified - F41.9 \n4. Intellectual disability, unspecified - F79 \n5. Other specified schizophrenia spectrum disorder - F28 (for treatment resistance? but not accurate) \n\nF28 is other psychotic disorders not due to substance or known physiological condition. Could use for treatment-resistant specifier but not standard. \n\nMaybe drop intellectual disability and add: \n1. F20.0 Schizophrenia \n2. F63.9 Impulse control disorder \n3. F41.9 Anxiety disorder \n4. F43.9 Reaction to severe stress, unspecified \n5. F99 Unspecified mental disorder \n\nBut need to base on vignette. The key is schizophrenia, and the incident might be due to residual psychosis or poor impulse control. \n\nGiven the rubric, I need to provide top 5 diagnoses. So: \n1. Paranoid Schizophrenia - F20.0 \n2. Other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder (impulsive aggression) - F63.8 \n3. Other specified anxiety disorder (situational anxiety) - F41.8 \n4. Unspecified intellectual disability - F79 \n5. Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder (for childhood-onset and treatment resistance) but same as F20.0, so maybe F29 Unspecified psychosis? Not better. \n\nAlternatively, use F20.1 for disorganized schizophrenia? But vignette says paranoid type. \n\nMaybe: \n1. F20.0 Paranoid Schizophrenia \n2. F63.9 Unspecified impulse control disorder \n3. F41.9 Unspecified anxiety disorder \n4. F79 Unspecified intellectual disability \n5. F89 Unspecified neurodevelopmental disorder \n\nYes, that seems plausible based on the information.",

He said his mood and self-confidence were tied to his dating. Being single made him feel desperate, but desperation made it even harder to get a girlfriend. He said he felt trapped by that spiral. Since the latest breakup, he had been quite sad, with frequent crying spells. It was this depression that had prompted him to seek treatment. He denied all other symptoms of depression, including problems with sleep, appetite, energy, suicidality, and ability to enjoy things.\n\nMr. Irvin initially denied taking any medications, but he eventually revealed that 1 year earlier his primary care physician had begun to prescribe alprazolam 0.5 mg\/day for \u201canxiety.\u201d His dose had escalated, and at the time of the evaluation, Mr. Irvin was taking 5 mg\/day and getting prescriptions from three different physicians. Cutting back led to anxiety and \u201cthe shakes.\u201d\n\nMr. Irvin denied any prior personal or family psychiatric history, including outpatient psychiatric appointments.\n\nAfter hearing this history, the psychiatrist was concerned about Mr. Irvin\u2019s escalating alprazolam use and his chronic difficulties with independence. She thought the most accurate diagnosis was benzodiazepine use disorder comorbid with a personality disorder. However, she was concerned about the negative unintended effects that these diagnoses might have on the patient, including his employment and insurance coverage, as well as how he would be dealt with by future clinicians. She typed into the electronic medical record a diagnosis of \u201cadjustment disorder with depressed mood.\u201d Two weeks later, Mr. Irvin\u2019s insurance company asked her for his diagnosis, and she gave the same diagnosis.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading through the clinical case vignette to extract all the relevant information. Nate is a 31-year-old man seeking help for lack of self-confidence and difficulties with assertiveness. He's stuck in a dead-end job and struggles with independent decisions. He's been in short-term relationships where he goes to great lengths to please his partners, even if it means doing things he doesn't enjoy. Recently, he's been sad and crying after a breakup but denies other depressive symptoms like sleep or appetite changes. \n\nWait, he's also on alprazolam, which he initially hid. His dose escalated to 5 mg\/day from multiple doctors, and he experiences withdrawal symptoms when cutting back. The psychiatrist suspects benzodiazepine use disorder and a personality disorder but documents adjustment disorder instead due to concerns about stigma and insurance.\n\nSo, first, I need to identify the primary diagnosis. The escalating alprazolam use, obtaining it from multiple doctors, and withdrawal symptoms point clearly to a substance use disorder. Specifically, Benzodiazepine Use Disorder seems fitting here.\n\nNext, the chronic patterns in his relationships and decision-making. He has lifelong issues with assertiveness, relies heavily on others for direction, and changes his interests to please partners. This sounds like Dependent Personality Disorder, especially the fear of separation and needing others to assume responsibility.\n\nThen, the recent breakup triggered sad mood and crying spells, but without other depressive symptoms. That could be Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, which the psychiatrist noted. However, since he denies other depressive symptoms, Major Depressive Disorder might not fit as well.\n\nAlso, his anxiety related to decision-making and possibly underlying anxiety disorders. Given his reliance on alprazolam for anxiety, maybe Unspecified Anxiety Disorder is worth considering. But since he's using benzodiazepines, the anxiety could be substance-induced or a separate issue.\n\nLastly, considering the pattern of seeking multiple prescriptions and hiding medication use, that reinforces the substance use disorder diagnosis. So, structuring the list: Benzodiazepine Use Disorder as primary, then Dependent Personality Disorder, Adjustment Disorder, and possibly other anxiety or depressive disorders as differentials.\n\nWait, the rubric says to list the top five diagnoses with ICD-10 codes. Let me map each: F13.20 for Benzodiazepine Use Disorder (since no specification of remission), F60.7 for Dependent Personality Disorder, F43.21 for Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, F41.9 for Unspecified Anxiety Disorder, and maybe F34.1 for Persistent Depressive Disorder if the sadness is chronic, but he only reports it recently post-breakup. Alternatively, since he has chronic low self-confidence, that could be dysthymia, but the vignette emphasizes recent sadness after the breakup, so Adjustment Disorder might be more acute.\n\nI think the primary should be the substance use disorder because it's the most pressing issue with clear evidence. Then personality disorder, adjustment disorder, and other possibilities. Let me double-check the codes: F13.20 for benzodiazepines, F60.7 for dependent personality, F43.21 for adjustment disorder with depressed mood, F41.9 for unspecified anxiety, and maybe F34.1 for persistent depressive disorder if considering his chronic dissatisfaction, but the vignette says the depression is recent post-breakup. Alternatively, since he denies other depressive symptoms, maybe Unspecified Depressive Disorder is a better fit.\n\nHmm, the vignette says he's been sad with crying spells since the breakup but denies other symptoms of depression. So, Adjustment Disorder fits better than Major Depressive Disorder. Also, his chronic issues might be better captured by the personality disorder.\n\nLet me list them in order of clinical priority based on the information. Substance use disorder is primary due to the risks involved. Then the personality disorder as it underlies his chronic difficulties. Adjustment disorder for the acute reaction. Unspecified anxiety for his underlying anxiety treated with benzodiazepines. And maybe an unspecified depressive disorder as a secondary consideration for his low mood, but since he meets criteria for adjustment disorder, that might take precedence.\n\nWait, the psychiatrist documented adjustment disorder, but according to the vignette, she suspected personality disorder and substance use disorder. So, maybe the adjustment disorder is what was documented, but clinically, the substance use disorder is more accurate. However, the task is to diagnose based on the vignette, not the psychiatrist's documented diagnosis.\n\nSo, my top five: Benzodiazepine Use Disorder, Dependent Personality Disorder, Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, Unspecified Anxiety Disorder, and Unspecified Depressive Disorder. But let me check if there's enough for Unspecified Depressive Disorder since he has sad mood and crying spells but no other symptoms. Adjustment disorder already covers that. Maybe Persistent Depressive Disorder isn't fitting because the sadness is tied to the breakup and being single, not a chronic low mood for two years. The vignette says he's been dissatisfied with relationships for 10 years, but the current depressive symptoms are recent post-breakup. So, adjustment disorder is more acute.\n\nAlternatively, since he has lifelong issues with self-confidence, maybe dysthymia is possible, but the vignette emphasizes the recent breakup as the trigger. So, I'll stick with adjustment disorder for the depressive symptoms.\n\nAlso, note that the psychiatrist was concerned about labeling him with personality disorder or substance use due to stigma, but diagnostically, those are present based on the symptoms. So, for accuracy, those should be included.\n\nOkay, finalizing the list: \n1. Benzodiazepine Use Disorder - F13.20\n2. Dependent Personality Disorder - F60.7\n3. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood - F43.21\n4. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder - F41.9\n5. Unspecified Depressive Disorder - F32.9 (considering his sad mood and crying spells, but without full criteria for major depression, this could be an alternative to adjustment disorder, but since adjustment disorder fits better, maybe replace this with something else? Wait, he denies other depressive symptoms, so adjustment disorder is more precise. Perhaps Unspecified Depressive Disorder is redundant. Maybe Other Specified Depressive Disorder? Hmm, but since he has adjustment disorder, that's already a depressive disorder. Maybe list Persistent Depressive Disorder as a differential for his chronic dissatisfaction, but again, the vignette focuses on acute symptoms post-breakup.\n\nThe rubric says to give top five diagnoses. So, I'll include adjustment disorder as one, and since he has anxiety symptoms treated with benzodiazepines, unspecified anxiety disorder. Then, considering his chronic low self-confidence and relationship issues, other specified personality disorder or avoidant personality disorder? But the dependent traits are prominent. So, dependent personality disorder is key.\n\nLet me check the ICD-10 codes: Benzodiazepine is F13.20, Dependent Personality Disorder is F60.7, Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood is F43.21, Unspecified Anxiety Disorder is F41.9, and for the fifth, maybe Other Specified Anxiety Disorder? But he has clear anxiety leading to benzodiazepine use. Alternatively, since he has substance use, maybe Substance-Induced Anxiety Disorder is possible, but the anxiety might be pre-existing. The vignette doesn't specify, so unspecified anxiety is safer.\n\nAlso, he might have traits of other personality disorders, like avoidant or borderline, but dependent seems most fitting. So, I'll go with that.\n\nWait, the formatting needs to be exact. So, list primary diagnosis first, then four secondary. The primary should be the most significant, which is the substance use disorder due to its acuity and risks. Then personality disorder, adjustment disorder, anxiety disorder, and maybe another depressive disorder or other specified personality disorder. But to stick to five, I'll include unspecified depressive disorder as a possibility for his sad mood without full major depression criteria.\n\nActually, since adjustment disorder covers the depressive reaction, maybe that's enough. The fifth could be Other Specified Depressive Disorder if adjustment disorder is listed separately. But adjustment disorder is a depressive disorder in a way. Hmm, perhaps list adjustment disorder as the primary since it's what prompted treatment, but clinically, the substance use is more urgent. The vignette says the psychiatrist thought benzodiazepine use disorder and personality disorder were most accurate, so those should be primary.\n\nI think based on the vignette, the psychiatrist's clinical judgment points to substance use and personality disorders as primary, but she documented adjustment disorder for practical reasons. So, diagnostically, I should list the accurate ones. Therefore, Benzodiazepine Use Disorder as primary, then Dependent Personality Disorder, Adjustment Disorder, Unspecified Anxiety, and maybe Unspecified Depressive Disorder as a catch-all for his mood symptoms.\n\nBut let's see: he has sad mood, crying spells, but no other depressive symptoms. That could meet criteria for Other Specified Depressive Disorder, like short-duration depressive episode or depressive episode with insufficient symptoms. So, F32.8 for Other Specified Depressive Disorder? Wait, ICD-10 code for Other Specified Depressive Disorder is F32.8, and Unspecified is F32.9. Since he has depressive symptoms but not full criteria, either could work, but unspecified might be more appropriate if not specifying further.\n\nAlternatively, since he has adjustment disorder, that already accounts for the depressive symptoms in response to a stressor. So, maybe only one depressive diagnosis is needed. But the task is to list five diagnoses, so I need to include other possibilities. Perhaps Additional diagnoses could include Other Specified Personality Disorder for mixed traits, but dependent is clear.\n\nMaybe consider Social Anxiety Disorder given his lack of self-confidence and difficulty in relationships, but he doesn't explicitly fear social situations, just dependency. So, unspecified anxiety is broader.\n\nAfter thinking, I'll list: \n1. Benzodiazepine Use Disorder - F13.20\n2. Dependent Personality Disorder - F60.7\n3. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood - F43.21\n4. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder - F41.9\n5. Other Specified Depressive Disorder - F32.8 (for depressive symptoms without full criteria, but since adjustment disorder is already listed, this might overlap. Hmm, but adjustment disorder is a separate category. So, both can be listed if considering different aspects. However, in practice, adjustment disorder covers the depressive reaction, so maybe replace the fifth with something else, like Unspecified Personality Disorder for possible mixed traits? But dependent is specified. \n\nWait, the vignette says the psychiatrist suspected personality disorder, not specified which, but dependent fits best. So, I'll keep dependent.\n\nPerhaps the fifth diagnosis could be Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder, which is the same as Benzodiazepine Use Disorder, so that's already covered. So, maybe just list the ones above.\n\nTo fill five, I'll include Unspecified Depressive Disorder as a secondary consideration. So, final list:\n1. Benzodiazepine Use Disorder - F13.20\n2. Dependent Personality Disorder - F60.7\n3. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood - F43.21\n4. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder - F41.9\n5. Unspecified Depressive Disorder - F32.9\n\nThat seems comprehensive based on the symptoms presented.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, the user wants me to act as an expert psychiatrist diagnosing a clinical case vignette. Let me start by carefully reading the vignette to extract all relevant information.\n\nPatient is a 37-year-old male with a history of hypertension, substance use (marijuana, methamphetamine), and psychosis. He was brought to the ED by police for aggression at a gas station, claiming people were the devil and throwing items. He was tased, given emergency IM meds (Haldol, Ativan, Benadryl), and then assessed by psychiatry.\n\nInitial assessment shows drowsiness but irritability, hostile behavior, grandiose delusions (being God), and persecutory delusions (devil after him). He's not on current antipsychotics. UDS is positive for marijuana, methamphetamine, and PCP. Started on Risperidone.\n\nNext day, he's less hostile but sleepy. Denies previous delusions, doesn't recall the gas station incident. Admits to using substances for two days straight. Homeless, wants to go to a shelter. Denies SI\/HI, hallucinations, paranoia, or grandiosity upon reassessment. Discharged after 24 hours.\n\nNow, I need to apply the rubric's Level 5 standards. For Data Extraction, I must identify subtle patterns. The key here is the timeline: acute agitation and psychosis coinciding with substance use, followed by rapid resolution after medication and sobriety. Past psychiatric history includes psychosis, but current episode is tightly linked to polysubstance intoxication.\n\nFor Diagnostic Reasoning, I need a nuanced differential. Primary consideration should be substance-induced disorders given the positive UDS and temporal relationship. However, past psychosis history complicates things\u2014could be a primary psychotic disorder exacerbated by substances. Need to prioritize based on DSM-5-TR criteria.\n\nTop diagnosis: Substance\/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder. The acute onset with intoxication, multiple substances involved, and resolution supports this. ICD-10 F-code would depend on the specific substance, but since multiple are present, maybe PCP takes precedence due to severity? Wait, DSM-5 specifies coding based on the substance. Here, methamphetamine and PCP are both stimulants\/hallucinogens. PCP might be more relevant given the agitation and UDS positivity.\n\nSecondary diagnoses: Other substance-induced disorders like intoxication and withdrawal. Also consider primary psychotic disorders like schizophrenia or bipolar with psychotic features, but the rapid resolution and substance link make them less likely. Adjustment disorder or malingering? Not supported. Personality disorders? Possible but not enough data.\n\nList the top five: Primary is Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder. Then substance intoxication, cannabis use disorder, stimulant use disorder, and rule out schizophrenia. Need corresponding F-codes.

    "vignette":"A 39-year-old Caucasian male presented to inpatient psychiatry after initially presenting to the emergency department with psychosis. He had been found crawling in a parking lot with several feet of intestines dragging on the ground. The patient was only responding internally during the examination, and a urine drug screen was positive only for cannabis. He received an emergent exploratory laparotomy with a partial colectomy. He stabilized medically but became briefly catatonic on day six of hospitalization, which was resolved with intravenous diazepam. On day seven, he was transferred to the inpatient psychiatry unit on a voluntary basis.\n\nOn admission to inpatient psychiatry, the patient was fully oriented and able to recall stabbing himself in the abdomen because characters in his mind told him to, having an out-of-body experience as he watched himself pull out several feet of intestines. He felt compelled to follow the voices' commands because he had guilt about his history of sexual abuse towards women. He then recalls running out of his apartment and waking up in the hospital. He endorsed paranoia and auditory hallucinations for the last 10 years but never sought treatment. He felt hopeless, yet believed his potential was infinite. He had no suicidal ideation and expressed a fear of hurting himself upon returning home if the voices persisted.\n\nHe had never been diagnosed with a psychiatric illness or received treatment, but he did see a psychiatrist at age 17 after he was charged with indecent exposure. He recalled periods in his life when he had little need for sleep, had racing thoughts, and felt that signs and advertisements were speaking directly to him. His social history was notable for heavy cannabis use beginning at age 18. He was a daily user for 5-6 years and began experiencing paranoia and auditory hallucinations. Despite quitting for two years, the psychotic symptoms persisted, and he reported currently using cannabis 3-4 days per week. He also had a history of trauma and was emotionally and physically abused by his father who had alcohol use disorder.\n\nOn a physical exam, the patient had normal speech and appearance, an expansive affect, and poor insight.

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the vignette. The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of trauma and cannabis use. He presented with psychosis after stabbing himself due to command hallucinations. There are several key elements here.\n\nFirst, the acute presentation includes severe self-injury, responding to internal stimuli, and a positive urine drug screen for cannabis. The brief catatonic episode resolved with diazepam, which is notable. \n\nLooking at the history, he has had auditory hallucinations and paranoia for 10 years, which started around the time of heavy cannabis use. Even after quitting for two years, the symptoms persisted. He also has a history of trauma, including sexual abuse perpetrated by himself and abuse from his father.\n\nHe mentions past periods with reduced need for sleep, racing thoughts, and referential thinking (signs speaking to him). That sounds like manic or hypomanic symptoms. No prior psychiatric treatment, but saw a psychiatrist at 17 after indecent exposure\u2014possible early behavioral issues.\n\nNow, organizing the data. The primary issue seems to be psychotic symptoms with mood features. The self-harm was directly due to command hallucinations, which indicates the severity of psychosis. The catatonic episode suggests a possible mood component because catatonia can occur in both psychotic and mood disorders.\n\nDifferential diagnosis time. Schizophrenia is a possibility given the chronic psychosis, but the mood symptoms like expansive affect and past manic-like episodes might point towards schizoaffective disorder. The vignette mentions guilt about past actions, which could be part of a depressive episode, but he also has elevated mood traits.\n\nSubstance-induced psychosis is a consideration because of cannabis use, but the symptoms persisted even during abstinence, so it's less likely to be purely substance-induced. However, cannabis use disorder is present and likely exacerbating the condition.\n\nGiven the trauma history, PTSD might be comorbid, but the primary presentation is psychotic. The command hallucinations related to guilt over past abuse could tie into PTSD, but the psychotic features are prominent and chronic.\n\nBipolar disorder with psychotic features is another strong candidate because of the manic symptoms (reduced sleep, racing thoughts, expansive affect) alongside psychosis. The catatonia also supports a mood disorder.\n\nPutting it all together, the most fitting diagnosis seems to be schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, given the combination of a major mood episode and psychotic symptoms without the mood episode. The chronic psychosis with intermittent mood episodes fits here.\n\nNext, cannabis use disorder is evident due to heavy use and persistence despite negative consequences. PTSD is likely given the history of trauma and ongoing symptoms. Also, other specified schizophrenia spectrum disorder might be considered if the mood episodes aren't fully meeting criteria, but schizoaffective seems more appropriate.\n\nWait, did the vignette mention depressive episodes? He feels hopeless but also believes his potential is infinite\u2014that's mixed features. The guilt about past abuse could be part of depression, but the expansive affect suggests mania. So schizoaffective bipolar type makes sense.\n\nPrimary diagnosis: schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type. Secondary diagnoses: cannabis use disorder, PTSD, other specified schizophrenia spectrum disorder (if schizoaffective isn't fully met), and perhaps persistent depressive disorder? But the vignette doesn't detail chronic depression, so maybe adjustment disorder? No, the trauma is significant, so PTSD is secondary. Also, rule out borderline personality traits due to self-harm and trauma, but not enough criteria listed.\n\nOkay, structuring the list. Primary is schizoaffective. Then cannabis use disorder, PTSD, other specified schizophrenia spectrum, and maybe bipolar I with psychotic features as an alternative. But since schizoaffective is top, bipolar would be secondary. Let me check the DSM-5-TR codes.\n\nSchizoaffective disorder, bipolar type is F25.0. Cannabis use disorder, moderate or severe? He uses 3-4 times weekly, so likely moderate, F12.20. PTSD is F43.10. Other specified schizophrenia spectrum disorder is F28. Bipolar I with psychotic features would be F31.2 or F31.9, but since schizoaffective is primary, maybe include that as a secondary. Alternatively, unspecified schizophrenia spectrum disorder F29, but other specified is more appropriate.\n\nWait, the catatonia\u2014should that be listed separately? Catatonia associated with another mental disorder is coded with the primary disorder, so no separate code needed. \n\nAlso, the history of sexual abuse towards others\u2014could that indicate a conduct disorder or antisocial traits? Not enough info for a personality disorder diagnosis, so probably not included.\n\nFinal list: \n1. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type - F25.0\n2. Cannabis use disorder, moderate - F12.20\n3. Posttraumatic stress disorder - F43.10\n4. Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder - F28\n5. Bipolar I disorder, with psychotic features, most recent episode manic - F31.2\n\nBut let's confirm the order. Schizoaffective is primary due to chronic psychosis with mood episodes. Cannabis use is comorbid and contributing. PTSD from trauma history. Other specified psychotic disorder if schizoaffective criteria aren't fully met. Bipolar I as an alternative if the psychotic symptoms are only during mood episodes.\n\nYeah, that seems comprehensive. Now, just list them without reasoning as instructed.",

    "model_thoughts":"Hmm, this is a complex clinical vignette requiring careful analysis. The patient is a 15-year-old male with chronic behavioral issues, irritability, and social difficulties. The key features include assaulting a peer, chronic irritability, angry outbursts, academic struggles, social isolation, and conflict with authority figures.\n\nThe absence of hallucinations, delusions, or substance use is notable. The patient's ability to care for pets and interest in basketball suggest preserved capacities in some areas. The chronic nature of symptoms rules out acute disorders.\n\nThe primary consideration is Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder given the persistent irritability and outbursts. Oppositional Defiant Disorder is a strong secondary possibility due to argumentative behavior and defiance. The assault and fighting point toward Intermittent Explosive Disorder. Academic struggles and social isolation suggest Social Pragmatic Communication Disorder or Other Specified Neurodevelopmental Disorder. The lack of psychotic features helps rule out other conditions.\n\nThe diagnostic codes need to align precisely with DSM-5-TR criteria based on the presented symptoms without extrapolation.",

    "vignette":"Frank Young, a 40-year-old business executive, was brought for a psychiatric consultation by his wife. While Mr. Young sat quietly beside her, she reported that a change had come over him during the last 6 months. He was either quiet and withdrawn or uncharacteristically irritable. He had begun to drink alcohol to excess in social situations, sometimes embarrassing her. He often came home late, or not at all, claiming to have been at the office. When away from home, he rarely answered phone calls and text messages. She wondered if he was having an affair. Mr. Young denied seeing anyone else and indicated he had just been having a hard time.\n\nAfter his wife left the psychiatrist\u2019s office, Mr. Young reported a great deal of stress at work over the last year as he tried to deal with industry-wide setbacks and personal financial losses. He said he felt down and depressed most of the time. He reported difficulty sleeping most nights, loss of interest in his wife and children, low energy, and feelings of failure and self-criticism. He had frequent thoughts of wanting to be dead and of suicide, but he denied any suicidal intent or plans.\n\nWhen asked about the alcohol, he acknowledged that he had been drinking heavily for at least 6 months. When asked about other substances, he asked about therapeutic confidentiality and then acknowledged that he had been using cocaine several times per week for about 9 months. He kept his cocaine use from his wife because he knew she would be judgmental. In the beginning, cocaine put him in a reliably positive, optimistic mood, and he found that he could more successfully churn through large volumes of otherwise tedious and discouraging work. Although his work required some socializing in the evening, he also began to regularly go to bars in the evening just so that he would have a place to comfortably combine cocaine with alcohol. He craved the high from cocaine, went out of his way to obtain it, and spent a lot of time getting high that he would previously have been spending with his family.\n\nWhen asked to clarify the sequence of work stress, cocaine use, and depression symptoms, he reported that he had felt worried and discouraged about work for a year, but the feelings of depression, loss of interest, irritability, insomnia, and low self-esteem had not begun until about 6 months earlier, 3 months after he had begun to use cocaine regularly. He experienced those depressive symptoms most of the day every day, whether or not he had taken cocaine within the last several days.\n\nMr. Young denied any previous episodes of depression, other mood or anxiety disorders, or suicide attempts. He drank socially. He had experimented with cannabis and cocaine as a teenager but had never developed a pattern of regular use or impairment until the past year.",

    "model_thoughts":"Hmm, this is a complex clinical vignette requiring careful analysis. The patient presents with overlapping symptoms of substance use and depressive features, with a clear timeline showing cocaine use preceding the onset of depressive symptoms by three months. \n\nThe primary issue seems to be the cocaine use disorder given its frequency, impact on work and family, and cravings. The depressive symptoms appear substance-induced but persist beyond acute intoxication, making it necessary to consider both as separate diagnoses. \n\nAlcohol use disorder is also evident from the increased consumption and social impairment. The differential should include persistent depressive disorder given the chronic low mood, though the timeline suggests it's secondary to substance use. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood is less likely since symptoms exceed what's expected from the stressor. \n\nThe diagnosis must reflect the primacy of substance use while acknowledging the comorbid depressive syndrome that meets major depressive episode criteria but is etiologically linked to cocaine.",

    "vignette":"Sebastian Lopez, a 27-year-old Hispanic freelance editor, was brought to his long-time HIV clinic by his worried partner. As the patient entered the clinic waiting room, he announced, \u201cGod has cured me! I can stop my antivirals!\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. Lopez fidgeted on a chair, furiously writing on a yellow pad, his partner provided the recent history. He said that the patient had been doing well until approximately 1 month earlier. At that point, he began an unusually intense editing project. After about 10 days of little sleep, \u201cboundless energy,\u201d and activity, Mr. Lopez seemed edgy, a little pressured, and \u201cglassy-eyed.\u201d That night, the two of them went to a party to celebrate the completion of the work project. Despite several years of Narcotics Anonymous meetings and abstinence from illicit substances, Mr. Lopez took crystal methamphetamine, a stimulant. Acutely anxious and paranoid that they were being followed, Mr. Lopez drank three martinis but still did not sleep that night. Over the ensuing days the patient became less paranoid, but he appeared increasingly distracted and his speech was more pressured.\n\nMr. Lopez\u2019s work project was returned with multiple negative comments and requests for corrections. Instead of focusing on his editing, however, he stayed up late every night, intent on finding a cure for HIV. He made inappropriate, hypersexual advances toward other men at the gym, where he spent much of the day. He lost at least 5 pounds after deciding he should take vitamin supplements instead of food and his antiretroviral medication. He refused to go to the emergency room but finally agreed to come to his routine AIDS clinic appointment to show his doctors how well he had done despite not having taken his medications in over a month.\n\nMr. Lopez\u2019s psychiatric history was without a prior episode of clear-cut mania, but he had been depressed as a teenager during the early phase of his coming-out process. That episode was punctuated by a purposeful overdose and a 2-week psychiatric hospitalization and treatment with antidepressant medication and psychotherapy. Mr. Lopez had discontinued the medication because it made him \u201chyper and edgy,\u201d and he stopped the psychotherapy because \u201cit was pointless.\u201d He used methamphetamine frequently for several years, which led to recurrent unprotected intercourse with strangers.\n\nMr. Lopez was diagnosed with HIV at age 22, at which point he went to an outpatient substance use disorder rehabilitation center and discontinued his use of stimulants and alcohol. His lowest CD4 lymphocyte count had been 216 cells\/mm3, when he was age 24, at which time his viral load was 1.6 million copies. He had been reportedly adherent to his antiretroviral medications since then. His most recent CD4 count, 6 months prior to this episode, had been 526 cells\/mm3. His viral load had been undetectable. He had suffered fatigue but had not had any AIDS-defining illnesses. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain revealed mild cortical atrophy and periventricular white matter disease in excess of what would be expected for his age. The partner was unsure when Mr. Lopez had discontinued his antiretrovirals but thought it might have been months earlier. He also wondered if Mr. Lopez had \u201clost a step\u201d cognitively over the past year.\n\nHis family psychiatric history was significant for a maternal aunt who had received lithium and several courses of electroconvulsive therapy, but her diagnosis was unknown.\n\nOn examination, the patient was a sloppily dressed young man who told a pressured, disjointed story of events over the prior month. He was difficult to direct and was uncharacteristically irritable and devaluing. He was preoccupied with having discovered a cure for HIV through multivitamins and exercise. He denied hallucinations and suicidal and homicidal ideation. He refused cognitive testing, and his insight and judgment appeared poor.",

    "model_thoughts":"Hmm, this is a complex clinical vignette requiring careful analysis. The user wants a structured list of DSM-5-TR diagnoses based solely on the provided information, following specific formatting with ICD-10 F-codes. \n\nFirst, I need to extract key clinical details. The patient presents with a clear manic episode: decreased need for sleep, pressured speech, grandiosity (believing he cured HIV), hypersexuality, irritability, and poor judgment. The episode lasted about a month and caused functional impairment. \n\nThere's a history of adolescent depression with a suicide attempt, and a family history of possible bipolar disorder in a maternal aunt treated with lithium and ECT. This suggests bipolar I disorder as the primary diagnosis. \n\nThe methamphetamine use triggered acute paranoia but the manic symptoms persisted beyond intoxication, so substance-induced mood disorder is secondary. The patient also has a history of stimulant use disorder and reported alcohol use during the episode. \n\nHIV-associated neurocognitive disorder is considered given the MRI findings and partner's observation of cognitive decline. The previous depressive episode qualifies for major depressive disorder in the differential. \n\nThe formatting must be precise: primary diagnosis first, then four secondary ones with F-codes.
