    "vignette":"Terry Najarian, a 65-year-old salesman for a large corporation, presented for a psychiatric evaluation after his wife threatened to leave him. Although he said he was embarrassed to discuss his issues with a stranger, he described his sexual interest in women\u2019s undergarments in a quite matter-of-fact manner. This interest had surfaced several years earlier and had not been a problem until he was caught masturbating by his wife 6 weeks prior to the evaluation. Upon seeing him dressed in panties and a bra, she initially \u201cwent nuts,\u201d thinking he was having an affair. After he clarified that he was not seeing anyone else, she \u201cshut him out\u201d and hardly spoke to him. When they argued, she called him a \u201cpervert\u201d and made it clear that she was considering divorce unless he \u201cgot help.\u201d\n\nMr. Najarian\u2019s habit began in the setting of his wife\u2019s severe arthritis and likely depression, both of which significantly reduced her overall activity level and specifically her interest in sex. His \u201cfetish\u201d was the bright spot during his frequent and otherwise dreary business trips. He also masturbated at home but generally waited until his wife was out of the house. His specific pattern was to masturbate about twice weekly, using bras and panties that he had collected over several years. He said that intercourse with his wife had faded to \u201cevery month or two\u201d but was mutually satisfying.\n\nThe patient had been married for over 30 years, and the couple had two grown children. Mr. Najarian had planned to retire comfortably later that year, but not if the two choices were either \u201cto be poor after we split the assets or to sit around the house all day and be called a pervert.\u201d\n\nHe became visibly anxious when discussing his marital difficulties. He described some recent difficulty falling asleep and \u201cworried constantly\u201d about his marriage but denied other psychiatric problems. He had made a show of throwing away a half dozen pieces of underwear, which had seemed to reassure his wife, but he had saved his \u201cfavorites\u201d and \u201ccould always buy more.\u201d He said he was of mixed mind. He did not want to end his marriage, but he saw nothing harmful in his new mode of masturbating. \u201cI\u2019m not unfaithful or doing anything bad,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just excites me, and my wife certainly doesn\u2019t want to be having sex a few times a week.\u201d\n\nMr. Najarian denied any difficulties related to sexual functioning, adding that he could maintain erections and achieve orgasm without women\u2019s undergarments. He recalled being aroused when he touched women\u2019s underwear as a teenager and had masturbated repeatedly to that experience. That fantasy had disappeared when he became sexually active with his wife. He denied any personal or family history of mental illness.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Considering differential diagnoses**\n\nI need to list differential diagnoses while ensuring I don\u2019t include multiple diagnoses from the same category that can't co-occur, like adjustment disorder and GAD. The prompt asks for a structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses, which implies I need actual diagnoses. When providing the top five, including a primary diagnosis and four secondaries suggests I should focus on what's most likely. I might include some differentials for completeness, even though they're not necessarily comorbidities.\n\n**Structuring diagnoses list**\n\nThe instructions are clear: I need to provide only a structured list of diagnoses and their F-codes, which suggests they want a differential. I should include plausible diagnoses and rule out those unsupported by the information. I need to select diagnoses with some backing based on symptoms like anxiety, worry, and sexual paraphilia. Here\u2019s my final list:  \n1. Transvestic disorder - F65.1  \n2. Adjustment disorder with anxiety - F43.22  \n3. Fetishistic disorder - F65.0  \n4. Other specified anxiety disorder - F41.8 (or generalized anxiety disorder - F41.1).\n\n**Finalizing diagnosis options**\n\nI\u2019m looking at worry and insomnia, which suggest \u201cOther specified anxiety disorder\u201d could apply for subthreshold generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), coded F41.8. Since it specifies a case where the duration criterion isn't met, that seems preferable to F41.9, which is less specific. We could include it as a differential, but it might be redundant alongside the adjustment disorder. \n\nFor option five, I could consider \u201cUnspecified paraphilic disorder\u201d (F65.9) or even \u201cUnspecified sexual dysfunction\u201d (F52.9), but the patient denies that. I\u2019ll need to select something fitting but concise.\n\n**Exploring diagnosis options**\n\nI\u2019m considering that having a sexual interest in female undergarments isn\u2019t inherently pathological and might simply be a paraphilia without disorder, which wouldn't have an F-code. The DSM states that paraphilias without distress or impairment are not diagnosed. However, if there is impairment, that changes things. Since the distress is related to his marriage, it seems relevant. \n\nFor the fifth diagnosis, I could look at \"Other specified sexual dysfunction\" (F52.8) but that might not fit. I should focus on including both paraphilic and anxiety categories in my final list of five.\n\n**Finalizing diagnosis and codes**\n\nI\u2019m considering various potential diagnoses. The options include Transvestic Disorder, Fetishistic Disorder, Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder among others. Given this patient\u2019s situation, the anxiety seems relevant, but I need to nail down five specific codes. \n\nFor the top five, I\u2019m leaning toward:  \n1. Transvestic Disorder (F65.1) \n2. Fetishistic Disorder (F65.0) \n3. Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety (F43.22) \n4. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1) \n5. Unspecified Paraphilic Disorder (F65.9) \n\nI want to ensure I'm accurately reflecting his experiences while sticking to the guidelines for coding.\n\n**Preparing diagnosis list**\n\nI\u2019m working on finalizing the structured list of diagnoses, and I\u2019ve come up with several options based on the criteria. Here\u2019s what I\u2019m considering:  \n\n1. Transvestic Disorder - F65.1  \n2. Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety - F43.22  \n3. Fetishistic Disorder - F65.0  \n4. Generalized Anxiety Disorder - F41.1  \n5. Unspecified Paraphilic Disorder - F65.9  \n\nThese align with the requirements, and I\u2019ll keep the formatting consistent. My focus is ensuring clarity and adherence to guidelines without including any additional text or disclaimers.",

    "vignette":"A 27-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of convulsions.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 2 years before this admission, when shaking of the trunk, arms, and legs occurred. The episode lasted approximately 4 to 5 minutes and had been preceded by a sharp pain in the back of the head that radiated to the neck, blurred vision, palpitations, nausea, and difficulty concentrating. The patient did not seek evaluation, and no additional convulsive episodes occurred during the subsequent 20 months.\nFour months before this admission, while the patient was drinking alcohol at a party, his body suddenly became stiff, and he fell backward onto a table. Shaking of the trunk, arms, and legs occurred for approximately 5 to 8 minutes. He had urinary incontinence but did not bite his tongue. Five minutes later, similar convulsions occurred. The patient was taken to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. The results of computed tomography of the head were normal, as was an electroencephalogram (EEG) that was obtained over a period of 40 minutes. Treatment with levetiracetam was started. The patient was discharged home with a recommendation for follow-up evaluation at the neurology clinic of the other hospital.\nThree months before this admission, the patient was evaluated at the neurology clinic of the other hospital. He reported that despite the use of levetiracetam, convulsions occurred approximately once per week. The results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, were reportedly normal. Treatment with lamotrigine was started. There was no change in the quality or frequency of the convulsive episodes.\nOne month before this admission, while the patient was at work, his colleagues found him on the floor, and they witnessed \u201cshaking and clenching\u201d movements of the trunk, arms, and legs that lasted approximately 2 minutes. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was taken to the emergency department of a second hospital for evaluation.\nAt least two additional convulsive episodes occurred at the second hospital. During one episode, the shaking movements became less intense when the physician\u2019s hand was placed on the patient\u2019s shoulder; the movements resumed at the previous intensity when the hand was removed. In addition, the patient\u2019s eyes were closed. When the eyelids were opened manually, no nystagmus or gaze deviation was present. When the eyelids were released, the eyes shut forcefully and Bell\u2019s phenomenon (upward deviation of the eyes when closing) occurred. The patient did not speak but was able to follow simple verbal commands, such as an instruction to squeeze the physician\u2019s hands. In between the convulsive episodes, there were intermittent rocking movements of the upper body and nonrhythmic tremulous movements of the hands, and the patient did not speak or follow commands. After several hours, the episodes stopped, and the patient was able to speak. Admission to the hospital was recommended; however, the patient declined because of work obligations and anxiety about being in the hospital. He was discharged home.\nDuring the subsequent month, the patient continued to take levetiracetam and lamotrigine. However, the convulsions increased in frequency to one to three times per week.\nOn the morning before the current admission, while the patient was at work, his colleagues noticed that he abruptly stopped speaking and began to have shaking movements of the arms and legs. Emergency medical services were called. On their arrival, the patient\u2019s body was stiff, and there was twitching of the trunk, arms, and legs. No urinary or fecal incontinence or biting of the tongue had occurred. The patient was able to stand up from a chair and walk to the ambulance. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 111\/56 mm Hg, the pulse 83 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was awake and alert but did not speak. His eyes were open, with a primary midline gaze and blinking in response to visual threat. His body appeared stiff, with the arms and legs straightened. There were intermittent nonrhythmic tremulous movements of the trunk, arms, and legs. The patient was able to follow complex commands and to move the arms and legs symmetrically and against gravity, but there was a delay in motor activation. The deep-tendon reflexes were normal. Extensive scarring from burns was present on the face, trunk, back, arms, and legs.\nApproximately 45 minutes after the tremulous movements had stopped, the patient was able to speak but with limited fluency. Additional history was obtained. He had been taking levetiracetam and lamotrigine as directed; however, 3 days before this evaluation, he had stopped taking these medications because he was unsure whether they were effective. That morning, he had felt well until he noticed a sharp pain in the back of his head that radiated to his neck, along with sudden blurred vision, full-body numbness, and difficulty concentrating. A convulsive episode then occurred that lasted up to 20 minutes; during the episode, the patient was aware of events but sometimes had difficulty hearing. He described his overall mood as \u201cpretty good\u201d and did not report decreased energy or chronic fatigue. There was no history of psychotic or manic symptoms, suicidal ideation, or obsessive or compulsive behaviors.\nThe patient had a history of a febrile seizure in childhood, as well as several concussions that had occurred while he was playing sports in childhood. He reported that during the first 6 years of life, his social supports were limited, and he had experienced maltreatment by a family member; he did not elaborate on the nature of the maltreatment. In late childhood, he was involved in a house fire and hospitalized for a prolonged period because of severe burns on the face, body, arms, and legs. He had asthma, major depressive disorder, chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and panic disorder with agoraphobia. He took escitalopram daily and lorazepam as needed for panic attacks. He was in a long-term romantic relationship. He did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs; he smoked marijuana approximately once per year and drank one alcoholic beverage per week. His father had died of heart disease when the patient was a teenager; his mother had schizoaffective disorder and post-traumatic epilepsy.\nBlood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The blood lactate level was 2.4 mmol per liter (22 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.2 mmol per liter [5 to 20 mg per deciliter]) and the blood creatine kinase level 489 U per liter (reference range, 60 to 400). Serum and urine toxicologic panels were negative. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was admitted to this hospital.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Evaluating depressive disorder codes**\n\nI'm considering using \"Depressive disorder, unspecified\" with the ICD-10-CM code F32.A, but I wonder if it aligns with DSM-5-TR diagnoses. There\u2019s actually an \"Unspecified depressive disorder\" in DSM-5, corresponding to F32.9. The differentiation between \"Major depressive disorder\" and unspecified is confusing; it seems clear he has major depressive disorder. Coding as \"Major depressive disorder, unspecified\" (F32.9) might fit, but \"Major depressive disorder, single episode, in full remission\" (F32.5) could be more specific since he denies symptoms. He's 27, in a long-term relationship, and on escitalopram daily.\n\n**Identifying diagnostic possibilities**\n\nI'm evaluating the user's symptoms: they deny decreased energy or chronic fatigue and say their mood is pretty good. There's a history of major depressive disorder, but it's not clear if it's in remission. Typically, psychiatric history lists current diagnoses regardless of treatment status. While we must list five diagnoses, including \"Major depressive disorder, in remission\" might not be crucial. Other possibilities include \"Other specified dissociative disorder,\" \"Benzodiazepine use disorder,\" and \"Trauma- and stressor-related disorder.\" I'm considering the inclusion of \"Dissociative disorder\" for episodes of mutism, but perhaps it isn't necessary since conversion disorder can cover it.\n\n**Confirming diagnostic codes**\n\nI think it's best to include major depressive disorder (MDD) in the list. We need to confirm the F-codes.\n\nFor F-codes, I have:\n- F44.5: Conversion disorder with seizures or convulsions.\n- F43.12: Chronic PTSD.\n- F41.0: Panic disorder.\n- F40.00: Agoraphobia.\n- F32.9: Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified. But considering his history, I\u2019m wondering if F33.9 might be more appropriate. However, since we only know of one episode, I'll stick with F32.9. Yet, F33.40 is for recurrent, unspecified in remission. I'll need to check more on those remission codes.\n\n**Finalizing diagnoses list**\n\nI'm finalizing the output of diagnoses, so we can use F32.4 and F32.5 for indicating remission without specifying episodes. However, since we don\u2019t have that information, I\u2019m leaning towards \u201cMajor depressive disorder, unspecified (by history)\u201d which corresponds to F32.9.\n\nNow it\u2019s time to craft the final numbered list of five diagnoses with their respective F-codes:\n\n1. Functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder), with attacks or seizures - F44.5  \n2. Posttraumatic stress disorder, chronic - F43.12  \n3. Panic disorder - F41.0  \n4.

    "vignette":"Only upon the repeated and fervent insistence of her parents did 19-year-old Emily reluctantly agree to see a psychiatrist. \u201cIt\u2019s not me you want to see,\u201d Emily proclaimed emphatically. \u201cIt\u2019s my insane parents who need your help.\u201d Emily did not offer a chief complaint, aside from the concern that her parents were driving her \u201ccrazy.\u201d She added, \u201cEverything is going great in my life. I have plenty of friends, go out almost every night, and always have lots of fun.\u201d\n\nWhile Emily was taking some time away from \u201cthe so-called real world,\u201d her sister was attending Duke University, her younger brother was excelling at a competitive private high school, and both her parents seemed to enjoy their careers as radiologists. She asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s enough strivers for one family?\u201d\n\nEmily agreed to have her parents join the session, and they told a different story. They tearfully disclosed that their daughter had become irritable, unproductive, and oppositional. She drank to intoxication almost every night, often not returning home for an entire weekend. In searching her room, they had found small amounts of marijuana, alprazolam (Xanax), cocaine, and prescription stimulants. The parents described the changes in Emily\u2019s personality as \u201can adolescent nightmare\u201d and described her friends as \u201closers who do nothing but dye their hair, get tattoos, and hate everything.\u201d Emily\u2019s attitudes and behavior contrasted markedly with those of her parents and siblings. \u201cWe don\u2019t mind that she is doing her own thing and that she isn\u2019t conservative like the rest of us,\u201d her father said, \u201cbut it\u2019s like we don\u2019t even recognize who she\u2019s become.\u201d\n\nAccording to her parents, Emily\u2019s \u201cadolescent nightmare\u201d began 4 years earlier. She had apparently been a studious 15-year-old girl with a lively sense of humor and a wide circle of \u201cterrific friends.\u201d \u201cAlmost overnight,\u201d she began to shun her longtime friends in favor of \u201cdropouts and malcontents\u201d and began to accumulate traffic tickets and school detentions. Instead of her former bright-eyed curiosity, Emily manifested a lack of interest in all her academic subjects, and her grades dropped from As to Ds. The parents were at an absolute loss to explain the sudden and dramatic change.\n\nThe abrupt change in performance led the psychiatrist to ask Emily to take a battery of neuropsychological tests so the results could be compared with those of tests that she had taken when she had applied to a private high school several years earlier. In particular, Emily retook two high school admissions tests: the System for Assessment and Group Evaluation (SAGE), which measures a broad array of academic and perceptual aptitudes, and the Differential Aptitude Tests (DAT), which focus on reasoning, spelling, and perceptual skills.\n\nOn the SAGE, her average percentile scores dropped from the upper 10% for a 13-year-old to the bottom 10% for an adult (and the bottom 20% for a 13-year-old). When Emily took the DAT at age 13, she scored in the highest range for ninth graders across almost all measures. Her worst result had been in spelling, where she scored at the second-highest level. Upon repeating the test at age 19, she scored below the high school average in all measures.\n\nEEG, brain CT, and T2-weighted brain MRI scans showed no evidence of structural brain damage. However, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) T2-weighted MRI displayed a clear lesion in the left frontal cortex, highly suggestive of previous injury to that region.\n\nUpon further questioning about the crucial period in which she seemed to have changed, Emily admitted to being in a traffic accident with her now ex-boyfriend, Mark. Although Emily did not recall much from this episode, she remembered that she hit her head and that she had bad headaches for many weeks thereafter. Because Emily was not bleeding and there was no damage to the car, neither Mark nor Emily reported the incident to anyone. With Emily\u2019s permission, the psychiatrist contacted Mark, who was away at college but a willing and excellent historian. He remembered the incident well. \u201cEmily hit her head very, very hard on the dashboard of my car. She was not totally unconscious but very dazed. For about 3 hours, she spoke very slowly, complained that her head hurt badly, and was confused. For about 2 hours she didn\u2019t know where she was or what day it was. She also threw up twice. I was really scared, but Emily didn\u2019t want me to worry her parents since they\u2019re so overprotective. And then she broke up with me, and we\u2019ve hardly spoken since.\u201d",

    "model_thoughts":"**Clarifying diagnoses codes**\n\nOkay, so I need to focus on the request not to include non-psychiatric diagnoses that don\u2019t use F codes. This means I should only provide F02.81, which is for \"Dementia in other diseases classified elsewhere with behavioral disturbance.\" If there's no behavioral disturbance, it\u2019s F02.80. I\u2019m also considering other potential codes, like F07.81 for postconcussional syndrome, but I realize there might be differences in mapping between DSM and ICD-10. I'll have to check the ICD-10 codes for TBI-related disorders.\n\n**Reviewing ICD-10-CM codes**\n\nI\u2019m examining various ICD-10-CM codes related to personality and behavioral disorders, including F07.81 for postconcussional syndrome and F02.81 for major neurocognitive disorder with behavioral disturbance. It\u2019s interesting because major NCD due to TBI could possibly be coded with F07.81; however, it might not be that straightforward. According to DSM-5-TR, major NCD due to TBI aligns with F02.81 and F02.80 for the absence of behavioral disturbance, plus I need to remember the underlying condition code as well.\n\n**Analyzing neurocognitive disorder codes**\n\nFor \"Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Traumatic Brain Injury,\" the ICD-10-CM code is G31.84, indicating mild cognitive impairment, plus the underlying condition detail. Major NCD corresponds to F02.8*, while mild NCD is G31.84, and unspecified NCD is F09. The case shows neuropsych tests indicating impairment, which affects her independence\u2014she\u2019s struggling academically, exhibiting poor judgment, and has legal issues, like traffic tickets. Her timeline shows significant changes in behavior and academic performance since the accident, suggesting impairment in both social and academic functioning.\n\n**Assessing substance use and disorders**\n\nThe subject drinks to intoxication almost every night and sometimes doesn't return home on weekends, showing irritability and unproductiveness. This might indicate dependence on her parents and a lack of functioning, making major NCD plausible. However, diagnosing major NCD due to TBI at 15 requires deficits impacting independence, which aren't fully described here. There\u2019s also cognitive decline noted post-injury, with personality changes like disinhibition. Given her substance use, I\u2019m considering disorders like \"Alcohol Use Disorder\" and \"Cannabis Use Disorder.\" Parents have found evidence of these substances, so I\u2019ll prioritize those most relevant.\n\n**Determining diagnoses and codes**\n\nThis case suggests experimentation with multiple substances, with alcohol being the primary concern. I\u2019m thinking of including diagnoses like Alcohol Use Disorder and possibly others such as Cannabis Use Disorder. However, it\u2019s tricky because I need to ensure I don\u2019t exceed the four secondary diagnoses. \n\nFor the primary diagnosis, I\u2019m leaning toward Major Neurocognitive Disorder due to TBI, while the secondary ones could be personality changes due to TBI, Alcohol Use Disorder (F10.20), Cannabis Use Disorder (F12.10), and perhaps a stimulant use disorder. I\u2019ll work on finalizing the list while ensuring the codes are accurate.\n\n**Weighing diagnoses and codes**\n\nI\u2019m considering cannabis use disorder, which could be F12.10 for mild or F12.20 if we think it's moderate\/severe. For stimulant use disorder (cocaine), I may go with F14.10 since we're unsure of frequency. \n\nI might also consider policies around other substances and their corresponding codes. Ultimately, I\u2019m aiming for five top diagnoses, including Major Neurocognitive Disorder due to TBI, Alcohol Use Disorder, and then two additional substances. It\u2019s tricky to narrow down which substances to include, but I believe I can finalize that list.\n\n**Finalizing psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nLet's analyze the case: the abrupt change at 15, the decline in performance, personality shifts, and the impact of heavy drinking and drug use. The neuropsych testing and MRI results suggest a plausible TBI cause. I'll focus on five main diagnoses and their corresponding ICD-10 codes:\n\n1. Major neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury, with behavioral disturbance - F02.81\n2. Alcohol use disorder, moderate to severe - F10.20\n3. Cannabis use disorder, mild - F12.10\n4. Stimulant (cocaine) use disorder, mild - F14.10\n5. Personality change due to another medical condition (traumatic brain injury) - F07.0\n\nThis structure addresses the most relevant information.\n\n**Determining appropriate diagnoses**\n\nLet's consider \"Other Specified Neurocognitive Disorder\" F09, but it lacks specificity. Major neurocognitive disorder uses F02.81, which meets the requirement for F codes. The vignette indicates a severe decline, suggesting that major NCD might fit, but I want to make sure I\u2019m accurate. \n\nI can't use mild NCD due to the code restrictions, but might start with F09 if we can't decide. However, given the evidence of significant cognitive decline, major NCD is plausible. I also need to evaluate potential secondary diagnoses for support.\n\n**Choosing substance use diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m considering various diagnoses for the user, focusing on the five most relevant. I\u2019m thinking the primary diagnosis should be major neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury, followed by personality change due to another medical condition. Alcohol use disorder is significant here, as she drinks heavily almost every night, so next would be cannabis use disorder and cocaine use disorder. But I might also consider polysubstance use for a more accurate representation. Ultimately, I need to ensure proper prioritization and correct coding for each diagnosis.\n\n**Finalizing substance use diagnoses**\n\nI'm assessing the diagnoses, particularly for alcohol use disorder. Without tolerance or withdrawal symptoms, it might be mild, but the user likely fulfills several DSM-5 criteria, indicating a potential moderate to severe condition. The phrase \"drank to intoxication almost every night\" suggests heavy use, possibly leading to blackouts. For cannabis and cocaine, there\u2019s little evidence, so I might classify them under unspecified substance use disorder. Ultimately, I need to deliver a clean and concise final list without extra details or medical codes.",

The couple agreed that Mr. Sandahl had become \u201calmost impossible to live with.\u201d Mrs. Sandahl reported that although she had always considered her husband \u201chigh-strung,\u201d his outbursts were increasing in both frequency and intensity, and she worried that he would become violent with her.\n\nTheir most recent argument began when Mr. Sandahl came home after a \u201chard day at work\u201d to find that dinner was not ready. When he entered the kitchen and saw his wife sitting at the table reading the newspaper, he \u201cexploded\u201d and launched into a tirade about how \u201cbad\u201d a wife she was. When Mrs. Sandahl tried to explain her own long day, Mr. Sandahl cursed at her and broke glassware and a kitchen chair. Terrified, she ran out of the kitchen, gathered up the toddlers, and left for her mother\u2019s house a few miles away. The next day, she told her husband that he would need to get help immediately or prepare for a divorce.\n\nMr. Sandahl said his \u201cblowups\u201d began in childhood but did not become \u201cproblematic\u201d for him until age 13.

In between the altercations, he was active socially and a solid student.\n\nMr. Sandahl estimated that he had had approximately four verbal outbursts a week in recent years, generally in response to frustration, unexpected demands, or perceived insults. In addition to these heated verbal tussles, Mr. Sandahl described acts of violence about every 2 months; for example, he threw a computer monitor across the room when it started \u201cacting up,\u201d he kicked a hole in a wall when one of his children would not quit crying, and he destroyed his mobile phone during an argument with his mother. He denied physical fights since his adolescence, although he had nearly come to blows with a neighbor as well as an assortment of strangers and employees. The idea that he might physically hurt someone scared Mr. Sandahl \u201cto the core.\u201d\n\nThese outbursts blighted his relationships with colleagues and romantic partners and led to his decision to start his own landscaping company at age 25. The business had done well, despite his demanding style and \u201chair-trigger\u201d temper that led to high employee turnover.\n\nMr. Sandahl described the episodes as short-lived, reaching a peak within seconds and rarely lasting more than a few minutes. Between episodes, he described himself as feeling \u201cfine.\u201d He had experienced brief periods of depressed mood and increased anxiety, but these had not impaired him significantly and tended to resolve on their own within a week. Mr. Sandahl drank socially, but neither he nor his wife linked the outbursts to the alcohol. He had a history of experimentation with various drugs of abuse, but not in recent years.\n\nMr. Sandahl reported at least two other immediate family members with significant \u201canger issues.\u201d His father was emotionally abusive and perfectionistic, expecting \u201cgreat things\u201d from his only son. Mr. Sandahl\u2019s older sister also had problems with her temper; he attributed her three divorces to her emotionally abusive behavior.\n\nOn examination, Mr. Sandahl was casually dressed, cooperative, and coherent. He was worried about his behavior and contrite toward his wife. He denied depression, psychosis, and confusion. He denied any thoughts of hurting himself or others. He was cognitively intact. His insight and judgment were good during the course of the interview.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Clarifying diagnostic approach**\n\nI realize that the task requires identifying the top five most likely diagnoses from a clinical vignette, rather than listing those that fully meet the criteria. Since the prompt implies we should only consider conditions present, it\u2019s essential not to fabricate any information. For secondary diagnoses, I think I can include potential comorbidities supported by the vignette, but only if they can be reasonably considered. The focus here is on differential diagnoses, so I should make sure to include those as well.\n\n**Listing likely diagnoses**\n\nI can start with Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) as the primary diagnosis. For plausible differential diagnoses, I should include Bipolar I\/II Disorder, Antisocial Personality Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, and Substance\/Medication-Induced disorders or PTSD. I\u2019ll ensure each diagnosis has its proper ICD-10-CM F-code. Intermittent Explosive Disorder corresponds to F63.81 in ICD-10-CM. Then, I need to confirm other codes: Antisocial Personality Disorder is F60.2, Borderline Personality Disorder is F60.3, and Bipolar II Disorder is F31.81.\n\n**Evaluating potential diagnoses**\n\nOkay, I see that Bipolar I Disorder could be F31.9, but the user doesn't have classic mania or hypomania. While irritability and explosive anger might suggest mania, those symptoms last only seconds to minutes, so it's less likely. However, I could consider \"Bipolar Disorder, unspecified.\" \n\nFor other potential diagnoses, Substance-Induced Disorders like mild Alcohol Use Disorder (F10.10) don\u2019t fit well since the user drinks socially. Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (F34.81) doesn\u2019t apply since it\u2019s for children. I\u2019ll also check other options like Adult ADHD, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, or personality disorders but they seem off as well.\n\n**Examining secondary diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m considering \"Posttraumatic Stress Disorder\" (F43.10) due to an emotionally abusive father, but there aren't any trauma symptoms described, so that might not fit. Intermittent Explosive Disorder seems like the best choice for recurrent anger outbursts. \n\nFor secondary diagnoses, I have to look at plausible alt explanations. Antisocial Personality Disorder doesn't match since there\u2019s remorse and no criminal history. Borderline Personality Disorder, Narcissistic Personality Disorder, and others all seem off as well, given the user\u2019s situation, so I\u2019ll continue assessing.\n\n**Identifying potential diagnoses**\n\nI'm weighing whether we can consider Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) as the primary diagnosis. For secondary diagnoses, maybe an unspecified personality disorder with anger dysregulation could fit, but we need to ensure they\u2019re plausible. \n\nWhile he socially drinks, that makes Alcohol Use Disorder questionable. There are possibilities like Posttraumatic Stress Disorder from childhood emotional abuse, but symptoms aren't present. Antisocial and Borderline Personality Disorders might fit based on signs, but they seem less likely overall. We want a well-structured list for the top five diagnoses with their corresponding F-codes, focusing on what's most likely based on information provided.\n\n**Choosing potential diagnoses**\n\nI'm considering whether he might have \"Adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct,\" stemming from work and family stress, but that feels chronic. Secondary diagnoses could include various personality disorders like antisocial or borderline, and bipolar disorder, as well as substance-induced disorders. IED seems fitting here, but we also need to look at the possibility of personality traits affecting his anger.\n\nFor the required structured list of top diagnoses, we\u2019ll include:  \n- Intermittent Explosive Disorder - F63.81  \n- Antisocial Personality Disorder - F60.2  \n- Borderline Personality Disorder - F60.3  \n- Bipolar Disorder, Unspecified - F31.9  \n- Alcohol Use Disorder, Mild - F10.10  \n\nThis list reflects the most plausible options based on available information.\n\n**Finalizing potential diagnoses**\n\nI'm thinking that he doesn't have pervasive conduct disorder, as he denies physical fights since adolescence, leaning more towards property destruction. Given his family history with anger, I see IED as a strong possibility. \n\nFor our list of diagnoses, here\u2019s what I\u2019ll include:  \n1. Intermittent Explosive Disorder - F63.81  \n2. Borderline Personality Disorder - F60.3  \n3. Antisocial Personality Disorder - F60.2  \n4. Narcissistic Personality Disorder - F60.81  \n5. Bipolar Disorder, Unspecified - F31.9  \n\nThese reflect the most likely options despite some uncertainty about certain traits.\n\n**Choosing top diagnoses**\n\nConsidering the user\u2019s condition, I see that he denies persistent depression but had brief episodes, which complicates the diagnosis a bit. Given the requirement to list five diagnoses, I'll lean towards including Intermittent Explosive Disorder as a primary diagnosis, along with Unspecified Depressive Disorder, Unspecified Anxiety Disorder, Alcohol Use Disorder, and Unspecified Personality Disorder. These have some support based on his symptoms like brief depressed mood and anxiety, along with long-standing interpersonal issues. \n\nSo, here's my list of top diagnoses:  \n1. Intermittent Explosive Disorder - F63.81  \n2. Unspecified Depressive Disorder  \n3. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder  \n4. Alcohol Use Disorder  \n5. Unspecified Personality Disorder\n\n**Finalizing diagnostic list**\n\nI\u2019m deciding on the top five likely diagnoses for a case involving intermittent explosive disorder. I see that Intermittent Explosive Disorder should definitely be the primary diagnosis. As for the secondary ones, I\u2019ll consider Borderline Personality Disorder, Antisocial Personality Disorder, Bipolar Disorder (unspecified), and Alcohol Use Disorder (mild). \n\nEach of these diagnoses matches with ICD-10 codes, and they all reflect the characteristics of the behaviors discussed in the case. Here's the list:\n\n1. Intermittent Explosive Disorder - F63.81  \n2. Borderline Personality Disorder - F60.3  \n3. Antisocial Personality Disorder - F60.2  \n4. Bipolar Disorder, unspecified - F31.9  \n5. Alcohol Use Disorder, mild - F10.10\n\n**Formatting diagnoses list**\n\nI need to prepare a list of the top five likely diagnoses without adding any extra details. It seems that I can include:\n\n1. Intermittent Explosive Disorder - F63.81  \n2. Borderline Personality Disorder - F60.3  \n3. Antisocial Personality Disorder - F60.2  \n4. Unspecified Bipolar and Related Disorder - F31.9  \n5. Alcohol Use Disorder, mild - F10.10  \n\nThis format meets the requirements and only includes the necessary information in a clear manner!",

    "vignette":"J is a mid-20s military service member living independently in the community with a partner. J has a history of multiple ACEs (ACE scale score of 10\/10), with caregivers that were both physically and emotionally abusive when J's needs were voiced, resulting in a belief that it was unacceptable, unsafe, and futile to resolve interpersonal problems with caregivers, thus creating a sense of powerlessness and helplessness. Child and family services were never involved, and no legal charges were ever laid against the family for the abuse that J endured. J struggled with containing anger since early childhood resulting in physical and verbal aggression towards peers and teachers at school and family members at home. Caregivers attempted to contain J's aggressive behavior through forced administration of psychiatric medication. While growing up, J feared others and preferred to be alone, despite longing for family and friends. Socialization with peers proved difficult, as J was easily overwhelmed by noise associated with social contact and was frequently ridiculed or misunderstood while trying to verbally communicate.\n\nAs a young adult, J left family to enter the military, which became an immediate source of attachment and social belonging. More recently, J became increasingly unable to cope with anger following an ill-suited work position and a musculoskeletal injury, resulting in frequent angry verbal altercations and threats of violence towards military peers who placed restrictions on his activities. This led to disciplinary action and isolation from the unit, which further increased anger, hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts and led to a psychiatric military assessment. During the assessment, J disclosed feelings of intense anger which eventually manifested in an attack on a family member in an amnestic dissociated state. J's history indicated that pharmacological treatments had either been ineffective or caused significant side effects. The military psychiatrist determined J ought to be considered for military discharge. This triggered flashbacks of past childhood abuse and a significant increase in rage. J refused trials of psychiatric medications in the community due to a childhood history of forced medication administration. Due to significant safety concerns and limited ability to control aggressive behavior in the community, J's military psychiatrist referred J for an inpatient admission.\n\nOn initial assessment for admission, J appeared distrustful, angry, and concerned about acting out on anger and expressed suicidal ideation. On mental status examination, J was tall and appeared neatly dressed in a military uniform. J appeared hypervigilant and intensely watchful and was well spoken, using a \u201csharp\u201d tone of voice. J provided a detailed history, demonstrating a goal-directed thought form and a high level of abstract thinking, logical analysis, and good recall. There were no delusions or hallucinations, but J endorsed prominent active suicidal ideation, with intent to act upon these thoughts if not hospitalized; however, there were no immediate, specific suicide plans.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Considering developmental diagnoses**\n\nThe question doesn\u2019t mention developmental milestones, but hypotonia and feeding issues could lead to delays. It asks for DSM psychiatric diagnoses, so I need to work with the info provided; I can't just make things up. Since a genetic syndrome might cause global developmental delay or intellectual disability, I might consider \"Unspecified neurodevelopmental disorder\" or \"Global developmental delay\" as options here. The primary one could be Global developmental delay (F88), but I still need to list five diagnoses total.\n\n**Exploring feeding and developmental disorders**\n\nAt 12 months, I\u2019m considering \"Unspecified intellectual developmental disorder,\" but I'm not entirely sure. There's also this distinctive cry that might relate to Cri-du-chat syndrome, though it doesn\u2019t fit the F-codes since that\u2019s Q93.4 in ICD-10. We can look at neurodevelopmental issues instead. Hypotonia and motor delays could suggest \"Developmental coordination disorder\" (F82), but that typically applies after age 5. For feeding issues, I could think about \"Avoidant\/restrictive food intake disorder\" (ARFID) or \"Feeding disorder of infancy\" (F98.2).\n\n**Identifying potential diagnoses**\n\nSo, DSM-5 replaced earlier terminology with ARFID, but F98.2 is still used for \"Other specified feeding or eating disorder.\" I see that it's included in ICD-10, and DSM applies it for ARFID (F50.82). For infants, I think \"Rumination disorder\" (307.53) is relevant, but it\u2019s not described here. The excessive crying could suggest separation anxiety, but at 12 months, that\u2019s pretty normal. I might also consider \"Unspecified communication disorder\" or \"Language disorder.\" My top likely psychiatric diagnoses will focus on the observed physical features and global developmental delay due to genetic syndrome, alongside hypotonia indicating motor delay.\n\n**Considering neurodevelopmental diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about \"Unspecified neurodevelopmental disorder\" (F89), but that feels redundant. Maybe I should consider \"Intellectual developmental disorder, provisional\" (ICD-10 F79), though it\u2019s more of an unspecified intellectual disability. At 12 months, with microcephaly and hypotonia, there could be multiple features at play. However, I only have information about hypotonia and feeding difficulties, without cognitive or adaptive deficits mentioned. Global developmental delay usually applies when deficits occur in multiple areas, but we lack explicit evidence. Given all this, it's prudent to approach it as being \"at risk.\"\n\n**Listing potential diagnoses**\n\nI'm analyzing the case to identify the most likely psychiatric diagnoses. I could use \"Developmental delay, unspecified\" (ICD-10 R62.50), but it's not an F-code. \"Other specified neurodevelopmental disorder\" could fit, yet it requires significant impairments. Given the features like hypotonia and feeding difficulties, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Neurodevelopmental disorder associated with a genetic condition, like Cri-du-chat.\" For my top five diagnoses, I\u2019ll include:\n\n1. Other specified neurodevelopmental disorder (F88).\n2. Feeding disorder of infancy and childhood (F98.2).\n3. Unspecified intellectual disability (F79).\n4. Motor developmental disorder (F82).\n5. Unspecified neurodevelopmental disorder (F89).\n\n**Evaluating potential diagnoses**\n\nI'm analyzing the case while avoiding any fabrications. The presence of diffuse hypotonia and feeding problems suggests possible growth and developmental issues. While the father didn't mention delays, it's crucial to assess typical milestones by 12 months, such as crawling or babbling. I might consider using \"Other specified neurodevelopmental disorder\" associated with suspected Cri-du-chat. However, there\u2019s a challenge in identifying specific impairments. \n\nGiven the context, I can offer a list of potential diagnoses, like \"Global developmental delay\" and \"Intellectual developmental disorder.\" I'll carefully select the most relevant options while ensuring they fit the case specifics.\n\n**Assessing diagnoses for developmental concerns**\n\nI'm grappling with how to identify the appropriate diagnoses for this case involving a 12-month-old. Global developmental delay seems fitting due to some hints of impairment, like hypotonia and feeding difficulties. The cat-like cry could indicate a genetic issue, possibly suggesting Cri-du-chat syndrome. \n\nI\u2019m considering a key list of diagnoses such as Global developmental delay (F88), Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (F50.82), and Unspecified intellectual disability (F79). Diagnosing motor issues like Developmental coordination disorder (F82) may also be relevant. It\u2019s quite a challenge, but I want to ensure everything aligns correctly!\n\n**Determining appropriate diagnoses**\n\nI'm considering a range of diagnoses for this case, focusing on global developmental delay, which seems appropriate given the child\u2019s features like hypotonia and feeding difficulties. My thoughts are narrowing down to five diagnoses: Global developmental delay (F88), Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID, F50.82), Unspecified intellectual disability (F79), Developmental coordination disorder (F82), and possibly Autism spectrum disorder (F84.0). \n\nHowever, I'm cautious about overlapping diagnoses and want to ensure they are distinct yet relevant. It\u2019s a complex situation!\n\n**Exploring potential diagnoses**\n\nI'm analyzing various DSM diagnoses for this case, particularly considering the relation to Cri-du-chat syndrome. I have a list that includes options like \"Unspecified communication disorder\" and \"Other specified neurodevelopmental disorder,\" but there's overlap with global developmental delay. Since we want to ensure distinct diagnoses, maybe I should primary diagnose as \"Unspecified neurodevelopmental disorder\" (F89) due to the known abnormalities like microcephaly and hypotonia, while listing global developmental delay (F88) as a secondary possibility. This makes sense given the uncertainty around explicit developmental milestones. It's tricky, but I think I'm getting there!\n\n**Drafting psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI'm working on building a structured list of potential DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses for this case, particularly considering Cri-du-chat syndrome. I need a primary diagnosis and four secondary ones, but I have to be careful about duplicating codes like F88. Given the information, it seems logical to choose \"Global developmental delay\" as the primary diagnosis since it fits the description of developmental challenges. For secondary options, I can include \"Developmental coordination disorder,\" \"Avoidant\/restrictive food intake disorder,\" \"Autism spectrum disorder,\" and \"Unspecified intellectual disability.\" It\u2019s a bit tricky, but I think I\u2019m piecing it together!\n\n**Finalizing psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI'm working on the top five psychiatric diagnoses for the case, considering Cri-du-chat syndrome. I believe \"Other specified neurodevelopmental disorder (associated with suspected chromosomal deletion syndrome)\" - F88 should be primary since it aligns with the symptoms. For secondary options, I can include \"Global developmental delay\" - F88 (even though it duplicates), \"Intellectual developmental disorder, unspecified\" - F79, \"Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder\" - F50.82, and \"Unspecified communication disorder\" - F80.9. These choices are informed by the available information while adhering to DSM requirements. I have to make sure everything fits!\n\n**Determining primary diagnoses**\n\nI'm considering the appropriate primary diagnosis for this case. \"Global developmental delay\" seems typical for Cri-du-chat syndrome, but I have to weigh this against the instruction not to fabricate details. While there are signs like hypotonia and microcephaly, DSM-5 requires behavioral symptoms for neurodevelopmental disorders. I\u2019m leaning towards \"Other specified neurodevelopmental disorder (suspected Cri-du-chat syndrome)\" - F88 as the primary diagnosis. Then for secondary diagnoses, I can include \"Global developmental delay\" - F88. It\u2019s quite a puzzle, but I\u2019m narrowing it down!\n\n**Formulating potential diagnoses**\n\nI'm weighing the best options for diagnosing this case. I could list \"Other specified neurodevelopmental disorder\" if we want to avoid duplicates. For my top five, I\u2019m considering including \"Global developmental delay\" \u2013 that seems fitting for someone under five with hypotonia and feeding difficulties. I can structure the list as follows: \n\n1. Other specified neurodevelopmental disorder (suspected genetic syndrome) - F88. \n2. Intellectual developmental disorder, unspecified - F79. \n3. Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder - F50.82. \n4. Autism spectrum disorder - F84.0. \n5. Unspecified communication disorder - F80.9. \n\nI must ensure that each diagnosis is distinct, but it\u2019s tricky navigating the codes!\n\n**Drafting the diagnosis list**\n\nI'm trying to finalize the top diagnoses for the case. To avoid duplication, I'll focus on the most appropriate categories. My current list looks like this: \n\n1. Global developmental delay (suspected neurodevelopmental disorder associated with a genetic syndrome, e.g., 5p deletion\/Cri-du-chat) - F88. \n2. Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder - F50.82. \n3. Other specified motor disorder (hypotonia with motor developmental impairment) - F82. \n4. Intellectual developmental disorder, unspecified - F79. \n5. Autism spectrum disorder - F84.0. \n\nI need to gauge if keeping the specifier in parentheses is acceptable but want to ensure I stick to the core of what\u2019s required.\n\n**Finalizing diagnosis list**\n\nTo meet the requirements, I need to create a straightforward list of diagnoses without additional reasoning. I'll include:\n\n1. Global developmental delay - F88  \n2. Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder - F50.82  \n3. Other specified motor disorder - F82  \n4. Unspecified intellectual disability - F79  \n5. Autism spectrum disorder - F84.0  \n\nI\u2019ll verify the terms for accuracy and ensure they're aligned with DSM-5-TR specifications. It\u2019s essential to present the primary diagnosis and four secondary ones clearly, with no extra commentary.\n\n**Crafting final diagnoses list**\n\nI'm considering the most appropriate primary diagnosis for the case. Since there's likely global developmental delay, I'll use that as the primary diagnosis\u2014it's under F88. I also need to limit my top 5 diagnoses to psychiatric ones, avoiding labels like \"Cri-du-chat syndrome.\"\n\nHere's the final list:\n\n1. Global developmental delay - F88  \n2. Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder - F50.82  \n3. Unspecified intellectual disability - F79  \n4. Other specified motor disorder - F82  \n5. Autism spectrum disorder - F84.0  \n\nI need to ensure the formatting is correct before finalizing this output!",

Ms. Jacobs had a history of mood symptoms that had been under good control with lithium and sertraline, but her depressive symptoms had returned soon after she had arrived in a new city for school, 3 months earlier. She had become preoccupied with ways in which she might kill herself without inconveniencing others. Her dominant suicidal thoughts involved shooting herself in the head while leaning out the window, so as not to cause a mess in the dorm. Although she did not have access to a gun, she spent time searching the Web for places where she might purchase one.\n\nMs. Jacobs\u2019s psychiatric history began at age 15, when she began to regularly drink alcohol and smoke marijuana, usually when out at dance clubs with friends. Both of these substances calmed her, and she denied that either had become problematic. She had used neither alcohol nor marijuana since starting graduate school.\n\nAround age 17, she began experiencing brief, intense depressive episodes, marked by tearfulness, feelings of guilt, anhedonia, hopelessness, low energy, and poor concentration. She would sleep more than 12 hours a day and neglect responsibilities at school and home.\n\nThese depressive episodes would generally shift after a few weeks into periods of increased energy, pressured speech, and unusual creativity. She would stay up most of the night working on projects and building architectural models. These revved-up episodes lasted about 5 days and were punctuated by feelings that her friends had turned against her and that they were not really friends at all. Worried especially about the paranoia, her family had brought her to a psychiatrist, who diagnosed her as having bipolar II disorder and prescribed lithium and sertraline. Although Ms. Jacobs\u2019s moods did not completely stabilize on this regimen, she did well enough at a local university to be accepted into a prestigious graduate program far from home. At that point the depression returned, and she became intensely suicidal for the first time.\n\nUpon evaluation, the patient was visibly depressed and tearful, and had psychomotor slowing. She said it was very difficult to get out of bed and she was not attending class most days. She reported hopelessness, poor concentration, and guilt about spending family money for school when she was not able to perform.

I could also list \"Depersonalization\/derealization disorder\" but wonder if it\u2019s better viewed as a symptom of anxiety. I\u2019m also thinking about borderline traits and possibly \"Obsessive-compulsive disorder\" due to preoccupations, but I need to clarify this better.\n\n**Selecting top diagnoses**\n\nI need to identify the top five diagnoses, starting with \"Bipolar II disorder\" as the primary. For secondary diagnoses, I\u2019ll consider \"Major depressive disorder, recurrent,\" \"Borderline personality disorder,\" \"Depersonalization\/derealization disorder,\" or \"Panic disorder.\" I\u2019ll rank the secondary diagnoses based on likelihood. Borderline personality disorder is a contender despite some denials of key features, though it could co-occur with bipolar. Major depressive disorder might be less likely due to hypomanic episodes, but I still want to consider it. Panic disorder is a possibility too, given occasional panic attacks.\n\n**Assessing diagnoses**\n\nTo meet the DSM-5 criteria, there need to be recurrent unexpected panic attacks and at least a month of worry or behavioral changes, which seems less likely here. Depersonalization\/derealization disorder doesn't fit either. For adjustment disorder with depressed mood, symptoms returned after moving, but there's a history of mood disorder, suggesting stress triggered exacerbation. My primary diagnosis should be \"Bipolar II disorder,\" followed by \"Bipolar I disorder\" if paranoia points to psychosis, then \"Major depressive disorder,\" \"Borderline personality disorder,\" and finally \"Panic disorder.\" I need to weigh the possibilities carefully!\n\n**Finalizing diagnostic list**\n\nI need to compile a list of the top five most likely diagnoses with corresponding F-codes, focusing strictly on the psychiatric aspects. First on the list will be \"Bipolar II disorder, current episode depressed\" - F31.81. Next, \"Major depressive disorder, recurrent severe, without psychotic features\" - F33.2 comes second. Following that, I'll list \"Borderline personality disorder\" - F60.3. Next, \"Panic disorder\" - F41.0, and \"Depersonalization\/derealization disorder\" - F48.1. This should cover the top diagnoses based on the information reviewed!\n\n**Creating diagnosis list**\n\nI'm considering potential diagnoses with F-codes to develop a list of the top five. Starting with \"Bipolar II disorder, current episode depressed\" - F31.81, as the primary diagnosis. Next, I\u2019ll include \"Borderline personality disorder\" - F60.3. For the third spot, I want to add \"Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe without psychotic features\" - F33.2. Then comes \"Depersonalization\/derealization disorder\" - F48.1, and finally \"Other specified anxiety disorder (panic attacks)\" - F41.8. This should cover a comprehensive differential list!\n\n**Compiling potential diagnoses**\n\nFor the dissociative symptoms, I might consider \"Other specified dissociative disorder\" - F44.89 if there's not enough for a complete diagnosis of depersonalization\/derealization disorder. The case I'm looking at involves a 22-year-old with suicidal ideation and mood symptoms, possibly indicating misdiagnosis of borderline personality disorder as bipolar. I need to focus on the top five structured diagnoses with their corresponding F-codes, strictly without reasoning. My final list includes:  \n\n1. Bipolar II disorder, current episode depressed - F31.81  \n2. Borderline personality disorder - F60.3  \n3. Depersonalization\/derealization disorder - F48.1  \n4. Panic disorder - F41.0  \n5. Other specified anxiety disorder - F41.8\n\n**Finalizing psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI need to clarify the F-codes for the diagnoses I want to include. We're considering \"Bipolar II disorder, current episode depressed\" - F31.81 as the primary diagnosis. Following that, I think \"Borderline personality disorder\" - F60.3 and \"Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe\" - F33.2 should be next, along with \"Panic disorder\" - F41.0 and \"Depersonalization\/derealization disorder\" - F48.1. \n\nSo my final list is:  \n1. Bipolar II disorder, current episode depressed - F31.81  \n2. Borderline personality disorder - F60.3  \n3. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe - F33.2  \n4. Panic disorder - F41.0  \n5. Depersonalization\/derealization disorder - F48.1\n\n**Deciding on the final diagnoses**\n\nI'm considering the final list of diagnoses and wondering if \"Panic disorder\" should be included. It seems less likely but still plausible, along with the other conditions. \"Depersonalization\/derealization disorder\" might not be central either. I also think about including \"Obsessive-compulsive disorder\" or \"Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder,\" but I decide against it. \n\nUltimately, I land on these diagnoses:\n1. Bipolar II disorder, current episode depressed - F31.81  \n2. Borderline personality disorder - F60.3  \n3. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe - F33.2  \n4. Other specified anxiety disorder (panic attacks) - F41.8  \n5. Depersonalization\/derealization disorder - F48.1",

The patient frequently punches her mother in the legs, and in the stomach, and the patient even threw her ipad at the pediatrician when she asked the patient what was upsetting her. Most of the patients psychiatric history is gathered from her mother, given how irritable the patient is during the exam.

    "model_thoughts":"**Determining ICD-10 codes**\n\nI'm recalling the ICD-10-CM codes for bipolar disorder: F31.11 for mild, F31.12 for moderate, F31.13 for manic without psychotic features, and F31.2 for manic with psychotic features. The question asks specifically about the F-codes, probably wanting those base codes. For a diagnosis involving psychotic symptoms, I think I should consider F31.2. However, since there's mention of grandiosity, I might lean toward F31.1 to avoid overpathologizing, despite potential severity and hospitalization suggesting more complications.\n\n**Assessing bipolar diagnosis**\n\nIf I select psychotic features, I need to be cautious since the question focuses on diagnostic reasoning for mania with those features. There\u2019s a chance she might have pediatric bipolar disorder due to mood swings and irritability. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder could also be a possibility, but episodic mania suggests Bipolar I disorder is primary. For secondary diagnoses, I wonder about Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) considering her aggression and defiance. She exhibits some symptoms, like losing her temper, but I\u2019m unsure about the consistency across settings needed for a solid diagnosis.\n\n**Evaluating potential disorders**\n\nI\u2019m considering Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) since there are tantrums and aggression, but those episodes last for hours, which suggests mania instead. In IED, outbursts are usually impulsive, not premeditated, and might occur between normal periods. While IED could be a secondary diagnosis, the signs of decreased sleep and talkativeness point more towards primary mania. ADHD is also a possibility, especially with impulsivity, but there\u2019s no information on early symptoms. Trauma-related disorders could be worth exploring due to the father\u2019s deployment, yet the mania symptoms don\u2019t align with that.\n\n**Determining psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m considering various diagnoses. \"Other specified bipolar and related disorder\" could apply if episodes were shorter, but the length and hospitalization suggest Bipolar I disorder is appropriate. I might label it as \"Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe, with psychotic features\" for the primary diagnosis. Next, I could consider \"Oppositional Defiant Disorder\" or possibly \"Conduct Disorder.\" Attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder could also be relevant, along with \"Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder\" and potentially \"Intermittent Explosive Disorder,\" but we have to prioritize based on the information we have for the highest likelihood.\n\n**Identifying potential diagnoses**\n\nSince mania episodes are evident, Bipolar I disorder is the clear primary diagnosis. I\u2019m considering secondary options, such as Oppositional Defiant Disorder or Conduct Disorder. ADHD might also be relevant, but I need more information. Intermittent Explosive Disorder could fit, yet it\u2019s usually excluded during manic episodes. I should analyze whether any disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is possible, but it seems unlikely due to the presence of mania. Additionally, I need to list diagnoses with F-codes, focusing on the most plausible options based on the criteria that are likely met.\n\n**Listing potential diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m considering that mania episodes might classify as \"Other specified bipolar and related disorder\" due to their shorter duration, though they last several weeks. Therefore, the top five diagnoses I see are: \n\n1. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe (with possible psychotic features) - F31.2.  \n2. Oppositional Defiant Disorder - F91.3.  \n3. Attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder, combined presentation - F90.2.  \n4. Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder - F34.81.  \n5. Intermittent Explosive Disorder - F63.81.  \n\nI also need to ensure these are plausible, including potential differentials, without excessive reasoning, just listing them clearly.\n\n**Finalizing diagnoses and coding**\n\nI'm mapping out the appropriate ICD-10-CM codes for bipolar I disorder. For the current episode being manic, severe, and with psychotic features, I should use F31.2, or F31.13 if there are no psychotic symptoms. I lean towards F31.13 since there are serious behaviors like property destruction and aggression, suggesting severe mania without confirmed psychotic features. \n\nFor secondary diagnoses, I'll consider:  \n- Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder - F34.81  \n- Oppositional Defiant Disorder - F91.3  \n- Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder, combined presentation - F90.2  \n- Intermittent Explosive Disorder - F63.81  \n\nI'll ensure these are accurately coded and reflect the user's condition.\n\n**Narrowing down diagnoses**\n\nI'm analyzing the behaviors to figure out if the user might meet criteria for conduct disorder, but based on their actions, it seems there aren't enough criteria met. Instead, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) may be possible, but I feel uncertain about that diagnosis since there\u2019s mood dysregulation involved. \n\nI believe I should finalize the following diagnoses to provide a structured list:  \n1. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe, without psychotic features - F31.13  \n2. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder - F34.81  \n3. Oppositional defiant disorder - F91.3  \n4. Attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder, combined presentation - F90.2  \n5. Intermittent explosive disorder - F63.81  \nI'll consider potential overlaps and exclusions as I finalize the list.\n\n**Exploring differential diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m considering possible diagnoses following the user's symptoms that suggest bipolar I disorder, particularly current manic episodes. DMDD could be mentioned, but it appears less likely due to the episodic nature of mania. I might also look into \"Other specified bipolar and related disorder\" or \"Cyclothymic disorder\", depending on the duration of symptoms. \n\nFor top diagnoses, I\u2019ll structure them as follows:  \n1. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe - F31.13  \n2. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder - F34.81  \n3. Attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder, combined presentation - F90.2  \n4. Oppositional defiant disorder - F91.3  \n5. Other specified bipolar and related disorder - F31.89  \nConsidering the prompt, I\u2019ll ensure the list aligns with DSM-5 guidelines to present effectively.\n\n**Finalizing diagnosis codes**\n\nI need to follow the instructions precisely and provide a structured list of diagnoses with their respective codes without any additional reasoning or details. \n\nHere is my final output:  \n1. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe, without psychotic features - ICD-10 F31.13  \n2. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder - ICD-10 F34.81  \n3.

I'm double-checking the ICD codes to ensure accuracy and compliance. Here\u2019s my final output:\n\n1.

    "vignette":"Ashley, age 17, was referred for a diagnostic reevaluation after having carried diagnoses of autism and intellectual disability for almost all of her life. She was recently found to have Kleefstra syndrome, and the family wanted to reconfirm the earlier diagnoses and assess the genetic risk to the future children of her older sisters.\n\nAt the time of the reevaluation, Ashley was attending a special school with a focus on functional skills. She was able to dress herself, but she was not able to shower independently or be left alone in the house. She was able to decode (e.g., read words) and spell at a second-grade level but understood little of what she read. Changes to her schedule and heightened functional expectations tended to make her irritable. When upset, Ashley would often hurt herself (e.g., biting her wrist) and others (e.g., pinching and hair pulling).\n\nIn formal testing done at the time of the reevaluation, Ashley had a nonverbal IQ of 39 and a verbal IQ of 23, with a full scale IQ of 31. Her adaptive scores were somewhat higher, with an overall score of 42 (with 100 as average).\n\nBy history, Ashley first received services at age 9 months after her parents noticed significant motor delays. She walked at 20 months and was toilet trained at 5 years. She spoke her first word at age 6. She received a diagnosis of developmental delay at age 3 and of autism, obesity, and static encephalopathy at age 4. An early evaluation noted possible facial dysmorphology; genetic tests at that time were noncontributory.\n\nHer parents indicated that Ashley knew hundreds of single words and many simple phrases. She had long been very interested in license plates and would draw them for hours. Her strongest skill was memory, and she could draw precise representations of license plates from different states. Ashley had always been very attached to her parents and sisters, and although affectionate toward babies, she showed minimal interest in other teenagers.\n\nAshley\u2019s family history was pertinent for a father with dyslexia, a paternal uncle with epilepsy, and a maternal male cousin with possible \u201cAsperger\u2019s syndrome.\u201d Her siblings, both sisters, were in college and doing well.\n\nOn examination, Ashley was an overweight young woman who made inconsistent eye contact but often peered out the corner of her eye. She had a beautiful smile and would sometimes laugh to herself, but most of the time her facial expressions were subdued. She did not initiate joint attention by trying to catch another person\u2019s eyes. She frequently ignored what others would say to her. To request a preferred object (e.g., a shiny magazine), Ashley would rock from foot to foot and point. When offered an object (e.g., a small decorated box), she brought it to her nose and lips for inspection. Ashley spoke in a high-pitched voice with unusual intonation. During the interview, she used multiple words and a few short phrases that were somewhat rote but communicative, such as \u201cI want to clean up,\u201d and \u201cDo you have a van?\u201d\n\nIn the months prior to the evaluation, Ashley\u2019s parents noticed that she had become increasingly apathetic. A medical evaluation concluded that urinary tract infections were the most likely cause for her symptoms, but antibiotics seemed only to make her more listless. Further medical evaluation led to more extensive genetic testing, and Ashley was diagnosed with Kleefstra syndrome, a rare genetic defect associated with multiple medical problems, including intellectual developmental disorder. The parents said they were also tested and found to \u201cbe negative.\u201d\n\nThe parents specifically wanted to know whether the genetic testing results affected Ashley\u2019s long-standing diagnoses and access to future services. Furthermore, they wanted to know whether their other two daughters should get tested for their risk of carrying genes for autism, intellectual disability, and\/or Kleefstra syndrome.",

I see F98.8 for \"Other specified behavioral and emotional disorders,\" but that's an ICD-10 code, not DSM-5. The user wants DSM-5-TR diagnoses, so I should focus on those categories. We could look at \"Other specified neurodevelopmental disorder\" F88, or maybe \"Unspecified intellectual disability\" F79, depending on the severity I know.\n\n**Assessing adaptive behavior levels**\n\nI'm thinking about Ashley's adaptive behavior score of 42, which is significantly below the average. That might indicate moderate intellectual disability, as her abilities seem to align with an elementary school level and require some support. \n\nWhile she has some independence in dressing, she struggles with showering and can't be left alone. She understands some written language and can communicate basic requests, which feels more than typical for severe intellectual disability. So, it seems more fitting to categorize her as having moderate intellectual disability.\n\n**Evaluating intellectual disability classification**\n\nI'm considering whether to categorize Ashley as having moderate or severe intellectual disability. She requires support for daily tasks, can't shower alone, but can dress herself and express simple phrases. \n\nHer IQ of 31 puts her in the severe range, but her adaptive behavior score of 42 might suggest she falls into a borderline category between moderate and severe. Moderate typically fits her skills better, but I need to provide a clear diagnosis. I\u2019ll decide between \"Intellectual Developmental Disorder, Severe\" (F72) or \"Moderate\" (F71) for the structured list.\n\n**Assessing Ashley's abilities**\n\nI'm evaluating Ashley's skills: she can dress herself and decode words at a second-grade level, and she uses multiple words and short phrases. She has a good memory for things like license plates and is attached to family, but she needs help with showering and can't be left alone. \n\nShe\u2019s in a special school focusing on functional skills. Her abilities align with moderate intellectual disability, matching her need for support in complex tasks and her social communication style. Overall, it seems moderate ID fits her best.\n\n**Mapping F-codes for diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m working through the appropriate F-codes for Ashley's situation. For her, I'd suggest the following:\n\n1.

His wife of 49 years noted that 1\u20132 years before developing Parkinson\u2019s disease, Mr. Anderson had become somewhat less enthusiastic and motivated compared with his baseline personality, but not to the point of causing any concern or impairment.

He denied wishing for death, explaining that although he was not afraid of death, he wanted to enjoy life as long as possible. He added, \u201cGod does not give me more than I can handle. I can\u2019t ask for a better family, and I have had a full life.\u201d\n\nOther new symptoms over the prior few months included increasing fatigue, impaired concentration and memory, unintentional weight loss, and sleep-onset insomnia. Further history on his more chronic sleep symptoms revealed that, around 3:00 a.m. or 4:00 a.m. on most nights, Mr. Anderson began violently moving his extremities and moaning as though in distress, all while still seemingly asleep in bed. He often awakened his wife with these movements and occasionally struck her in his sleep. She sometimes used a different bedroom because of this. When he awoke from such an incident, he was coherent and briefly anxious, often reporting that he had been dreaming of swimming or running from something.\n\nHis wife took over driving shortly after his Parkinson\u2019s disease diagnosis, but Mr. Anderson was otherwise independent in activities of daily living such as paying bills and managing his medications. His wife described him as \u201cmaybe a little more forgetful\u201d over the past few years, but neither of them was concerned about this mild memory loss.\n\nPast medical history included prostate cancer (in remission), glaucoma, and gout. Labs from his recent neurology visit were unremarkable, including blood counts, serum chemistries, thyroid function, and vitamin B12 levels. Family psychiatric history was positive only for a granddaughter with ADHD. He denied past problematic substance use and all current substance use except two or three glasses of wine monthly. He denied any previous depressive episodes, psychiatric treatment, or psychiatric evaluations.\n\nOn mental status examination, Mr. Anderson was pleasant, cooperative, and interpersonally engaging. Resting tremor, shuffling gait, hypophonia, and bradykinesia all were evident at mild to moderate levels. He occasionally smiled, but his affect was difficult to fully gauge because of masked facies. He reported his mood as \u201cblah.\u201d There was no evidence of psychosis.\n\nOn cognitive testing, he had some difficulty on the Trail Making Test part B, figure copying, and word-list recall, the latter being helped by category prompts. On a standardized brief cognitive assessment, he scored 25 out of 30 points, which was in the normal range.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Reinterpreting diagnosis instructions**\n\nI think we need to clarify the instructions regarding DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses and their associated ICD-10 codes, especially F-codes. If DSM uses G-codes, we might need to exclude those from our top five. However, I might include comorbidities, like \"Other specified depressive disorder.\" It's essential to differentiate between diagnoses, such as \"Major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate\" (F32.1), as well as insomnia-related disorders like F51.0 and its variations. There's a bit to sort through!\n\n**Determining accurate coding**\n\nI\u2019m considering coding as F51.01, but I wonder if that would be accurate. Sleep-onset insomnia has emerged recently and could be tied to depression, but we can diagnose it if it's the predominant complaint for at least three months. We need to look at other conditions too, like \"Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder\" (RBD), which may classify under F51.8 for nonorganic sleep disorders. It seems ICD-10 has a different code (G47.52) for RBD, so this needs careful thought!\n\n**Exploring appropriate diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m considering using \"Parasomnia, unspecified\" (F51.9) since it allows for some flexibility. It might fit since there\u2019s evidence of parasomnia related to dream enactment, but then again, I\u2019m not sure if that's entirely appropriate. For the top five diagnoses, I\u2019m thinking about including \"Major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate\" (F32.1) and maybe a depressive disorder due to Parkinson's. The ICD-10 has specific codes for mood disorders linked to physiological conditions, like F06.32 for a major depressive-like episode. There's a lot to unpack here!\n\n**Structuring diagnosis list**\n\nI\u2019m facing a dilemma here. If I choose \"Major Depressive Disorder\" (MDD) as the primary diagnosis, I can't also select F06.32 because they're alternatives. However, I can list it as a differential in the top five diagnoses since they asked for the most likely diagnoses, including four secondary ones. This could include plausible alternatives, not necessarily comorbid. I should consider including options like \"Adjustment disorder with depressed mood\" (F43.21) and maybe \"Persistent depressive disorder\" (F34.1) as well. It's a lot to balance!\n\n**Evaluating potential diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m grappling with several possible diagnoses. If we choose \"Major Depressive Disorder\" (MDD), we can't also select F06.32 as they\u2019re alternatives, but we could include it in a differential. It seems we need to focus solely on diagnoses that use F-codes. While considering options like \"Unspecified neurocognitive disorder\" and \"Mild cognitive disorder\" (F06.7), I realize we can't include G codes. \n\nIt's a bit tough, but I need to ensure we're aligning with the requirements while also considering all the relevant symptoms.\n\n**Clarifying diagnoses and coding**\n\nI\u2019m wrestling with coding and diagnosing this case. The question asks for the top 5 likely diagnoses with corresponding ICD-10 F-codes while avoiding non-psychiatric diagnoses. While major neurocognitive disorder (NCD) due to Lewy bodies is probably not an option, mild NCD might fit but doesn\u2019t use the required F-codes. \n\nI\u2019m considering depression and its ties to Parkinson's disease, along with the symptoms presented. It's crucial to keep the responses aligned strictly with the F-code requirements while also ensuring they reflect the case's complexity.\n\n**Evaluating feasible diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m considering \"Mild neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson's disease,\" but its code doesn't fit with the F requirements. Instead, maybe I can use F06.7 for \"Mild cognitive disorder.\" However, DSM-5's criteria don\u2019t fully align. I need to stick to the necessary F-codes while also reflecting the specifics of the case. Depressive symptoms are present, and I need to differentiate between MDD due to Parkinson's and typical depressive symptoms. I also need to ensure we have a robust list of plausible diagnoses without diverting from the guidelines.\n\n**Examining symptoms for diagnosis**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether the symptoms might stem from \"Parkinson's disease-related apathy\" instead of depression, but we can't code apathy directly. We might think about \"Other specified depressive disorder\" if he doesn't meet full criteria for MDD, but he seems to qualify. His loss of pleasure and fatigue could be due to PD, not depression. There\u2019s a need to differentiate between depressive symptoms and apathy. I should create a list of plausible diagnoses while sticking to the F codes required.\n\n**Assessing diagnosis options**\n\nI\u2019m considering that mild neurocognitive disorder (NCD) requires some cognitive decline in one or more areas, showing concern but not impacting daily independence. He has some forgetfulness, but it doesn\u2019t bother him much. Although that fits mild NCD, it codes as G31.84, not F. However, F06.7 for mild cognitive disorder might work instead. \n\nI need to remember to only list diagnoses that use F codes, like major depressive disorder, depressive disorder due to another condition, and adjustment disorders. I\u2019ll create a structured list while ensuring I include the correct codes.\n\n**Finalizing differential diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m evaluating the different options for coding mild cognitive impairment and related disorders. I can consider using F06.7 for mild cognitive disorder since it\u2019s aligned with the DSM-5. However, since the instructions specify names for psychiatric diagnoses along with F codes, that might complicate things.\n\nI should also include diagnoses such as major depressive disorder and depressive disorder due to another medical condition. I need to ensure I stick to the F codes while including pertinent sleep disorders, like \u201cOther specified sleep disorder\u201d using F51.8. I\u2019ll compile a structured list for clarity.\n\n**Choosing diagnoses carefully**\n\nI\u2019m working to determine appropriate diagnoses for a case involving mild cognitive disorder and other related issues. Since the instructions specify using DSM-5-TR and F codes, I need to keep that in mind. \n\nI can include diagnoses such as major depressive disorder and adjustment disorder with depressed mood. I also want to consider including an appropriate parasomnia, potentially coding it as \"Other specified parasomnia\" with F51.8. Ultimately, I\u2019m focused on compiling a final list of five diagnoses that adhere to the requirements, even if some codes lean toward G rather than F.\n\n**Refining diagnostic choices**\n\nI\u2019m working through a list of possible diagnoses, focusing on neurocognitive disorders and related issues due to Parkinson's disease. I initially considered including \"Unspecified neurocognitive disorder,\" but that doesn't quite fit. \n\nInstead, I'm leaning toward depressive disorders since other diagnoses like major depressive disorder and depressive disorder due to Parkinson\u2019s seem more relevant. I also want to include insomnia and specific parasomnia that aligns with REM sleep behavior disorder. Ultimately, I need to select the primary diagnosis that best encapsulates the patient\u2019s condition and symptoms, prioritizing accuracy and compliance with the required coding.\n\n**Determining primary diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m sorting through the top diagnoses related to the patient\u2019s condition, focusing on major depressive disorder, REM sleep behavior disorder, and mild neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson's. However, I need to use specific F codes, and I\u2019m unsure about including G codes as that would conflict with the instructions. \n\nI\u2019m considering the primary diagnosis carefully\u2014whether to label it as Major Depressive Disorder or a Depressive Disorder due to another medical condition. There\u2019s a lot of nuance in differentiating between the two based on the patient's symptoms.\n\n**Clarifying depressive diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about the patient\u2019s depressive symptoms and their neurobiological basis, which may indicate they preceded motor symptoms. This suggests that mood changes could be an early sign of Parkinson's disease. I need to determine if the primary diagnosis should be \"Major depressive disorder\" or a mood disorder due to the medical condition. \n\nThe case asks for a structured list of psychiatric diagnoses, so I need to be careful and not over-specify when diagnosing. Let's narrow it down while ensuring I follow the line of provided information.\n\n**Determining top diagnoses for depression**\n\nI'm considering potential diagnoses like \"Mild neurocognitive disorder,\" but I might be mixing up coding systems. The patient's cognitive assessment appears normal, so maybe we don't include that. Instead, I could consider \"Other specified depressive disorder\" or \"A depressive disorder due to another medical condition.\" \n\nIt's essential to craft a structured list of the top five diagnoses that comply with the instructions. I might lean towards including major depressive disorder, a sleep disorder, and insomnia while ensuring I don\u2019t stray from the F coding requirements.\n\n**Exploring neurocognitive and depressive disorders**\n\nI'm evaluating options like \"Adjustment disorder with depressed mood\" and \"Mild cognitive disorder.\" While I think about the potential for \"Adjustment disorder,\" the stressors are unclear, especially since he's dealt with Parkinson's disease for two years without significant changes. \"Mild cognitive disorder\" might fit since he shows some deficits, but this isn't a DSM diagnosis. \n\nI\u2019ll lean toward a structured list focusing on DSM-5-TR diagnoses while respecting F codes. I need to ensure the selections are plausible and reflect the user's instructions accurately.\n\n**Refining diagnostic possibilities**\n\nAlright, I'm considering diagnoses like \"Other specified parasomnia\" and \"Unspecified parasomnia.\" Both have corresponding codes (F51.8 and F51.9) in DSM-5. Given the patient's symptoms of REM sleep behavior disorder, it makes sense to classify it as \"Other specified parasomnia.\" I\u2019m weighing whether to include \"Insomnia disorder\" as a separate diagnosis or treat it as a symptom of depression. \n\nI need to narrow down to five primary diagnoses. The plausible contenders are major depressive disorder, REM sleep behavior disorder, and depressive disorders related to Parkinson\u2019s. My final selections will balance accuracy and user instructions.\n\n**Selecting final diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m considering the most appropriate diagnoses for this case. The top contenders include major depressive disorder, mood disorder related to Parkinson's, and REM sleep behavior disorder. I need to decide whether to include insomnia or adjust it as a symptom of depression, but given the sleep issues, insomnia could warrant its own diagnosis.\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards specifying \"Other specified parasomnia\" (REM sleep behavior disorder) with code F51.8. For mild neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson's, I might have to use F06.7, even though it's not a perfect match. I\u2019ll need to focus on core symptoms and ensure the selected diagnoses accurately reflect the patient's condition.\n\n**Finalizing psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI think we're looking at potential mild neurocognitive disorder and possible major depressive disorder due to the symptoms, which include anhedonia and fatigue. After considering the ICD-10 codes that apply, I can list the final diagnoses:\n\n1. Major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate - F32.1  \n2. Depressive disorder due to another medical condition (Parkinson\u2019s disease) - F06.32  \n3. Other specified parasomnia (consistent with REM sleep behavior disorder) - F51.8  \n4. Nonorganic insomnia - F51.0  \n5. Mild neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson\u2019s disease - F06.7  \n\nThis captures the necessary diagnostic information based on the criteria.\n\n**Analyzing neurocognitive disorders**\n\nI'm diving into the codes and potential diagnoses related to neurocognitive disorders, particularly looking into the DSM-5's \"Unspecified neurocognitive disorder,\" which maps to F09. It seems plausible that this includes symptoms that cause distress without meeting more intense criteria. I\u2019m considering whether to include unspecified NCD or another specified disorder based on subtle cognitive deficits seen in testing. \n\nUltimately, we need to identify the five most likely diagnoses, incorporating major depressive disorder and potential sleep-related issues, alongside neurocognitive considerations and adjustment disorders.\n\n**Finalizing DSM diagnoses and codes**\n\nI\u2019m working on the final list of DSM diagnoses and their corresponding F codes to ensure accuracy. I think I\u2019ll go with major depressive disorder as F32.1 because of the symptoms presented. Next, I\u2019d opt for depressive disorder due to another medical condition, coded F06.32. \n\nFor the third diagnosis, I\u2019ll select other specified parasomnia with F51.8, followed by other specified neurocognitive disorder as F09. Lastly, I\u2019ll include adjustment disorder with depressed mood coded F43.21. This gives me a structured list of five relevant diagnoses with appropriate codes.\n\n**Listing diagnoses and codes**\n\nI need to compile a list of five diagnoses. For the primary diagnosis, I\u2019ll choose \"Major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate\" coded F32.1. Next, I\u2019ll include \"Other specified parasomnia\" with code F51.8 and \"Other specified neurocognitive disorder\" coded F09.\n\nFor the fifth diagnosis, I think \"Insomnia disorder\" with code F51.0 suits well given its relevance. I might also consider \"Depressive disorder due to another medical condition\" coded F06.32 as a primary option. \n\nThis should give me a structured final output of diagnoses and corresponding F codes!\n\n**Crafting final diagnoses list**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to list \"Depressive disorder due to Parkinson's disease with major depressive-like episode\" as the primary diagnosis (F06.32). For secondary diagnoses, I\u2019ll include \"Major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate\" (F32.1), \"Other specified parasomnia\" (F51.8), \"Insomnia disorder\" (nonorganic insomnia, F51.0), and \"Other specified neurocognitive disorder\" (F09). \n\nThis gives me five diagnoses, all formatted correctly according to requirements. Here's the final list:\n\n1. Depressive disorder due to another medical condition (Parkinson\u2019s disease), with major depressive-like episode - F06.32  \n2. Major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate - F32.1  \n3. Other specified parasomnia - F51.8  \n4. Insomnia disorder - F51.0  \n5. Other specified neurocognitive disorder - F09",

    "vignette":"A psychiatric transplant liaison service was called to evaluate Robert Jennings, a 50-year-old married white man, for a liver transplant in the context of an alcohol use disorder, advanced cirrhosis, and no other prior psychiatric history. Several weeks earlier, he had been hospitalized with acute alcohol-associated hepatitis and diagnosed with end-stage liver disease. Prednisolone 40 mg\/day was prescribed for treatment of the hepatitis. Prior to that hospitalization, he had been unaware that his alcohol consumption was seriously damaging his health and was shocked to learn that he would eventually require a liver transplant. Upon discharge, he began an addiction treatment program that was mandatory for him to be listed for possible transplantation.\n\nOutpatient psychiatric consultation was requested by the transplant team after the patient\u2019s family expressed concern that he had recently become increasingly irritable and anxious and seemed to be having difficulty coping with the requirements for transplantation. Mr. Jennings\u2019s primary care physician had recently prescribed alprazolam 0.5 mg as needed for his anxiety. This was initially helpful, but after several days his family noticed he seemed more irritable, lethargic, and forgetful.\n\nWhen interviewed, the patient said that he had been tired for months prior to the diagnosis and that the fatigue had hampered his ability to work (his job required making deliveries for a shipping firm). Although the diagnosis had been a shock, he said he had left the hospital feeling \u201cgreat, better than I\u2019d felt in years.\u201d For about a week after discharge, he described having enhanced energy and a sense of well-being, but he then began to feel anxious and restless. He slept poorly, unable to concentrate, and worried constantly about his health, finances, and family. He became less engaged with his family and stopped watching movies, normally his favorite pastime.\n\nHe denied having nightmares, flashbacks, avoidant behaviors, or racing thoughts. He also denied low mood, tearfulness, appetite changes, anhedonia, helplessness, hopelessness, or suicidality. He reported that he had started drinking daily 10 years earlier, stating that he enjoyed the taste of beer and liked socializing with friends after work. He developed tolerance to alcohol, needing to consume six to eight drinks per night to achieve the same effect. He described some withdrawal symptoms in the morning but did not drink during work hours; he underwent random testing due to his job as a truck driver. He did miss some family activities, preferring to drink, and this had been a source of marital conflict. He admitted feeling guilty about his alcohol use and its impact on him and his family. He denied using any alcohol since his hospitalization. He admitted to anger over having to undergo addiction counseling and had argued with the transplant team about this requirement. He denied having been an anxious person and considered himself able to handle most of life\u2019s challenges without being overwhelmed. His family confirmed his description of himself and viewed his recent behavior as uncharacteristic.\n\nOn mental status examination, Mr. Jennings was a thin, jaundiced, tired-appearing man. His gait was normal, but he was fidgety while seated. He maintained eye contact and responded appropriately, although he repeatedly made comments like, \u201cSomething isn\u2019t right\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s not all in my head.\u201d His affect was anxious and irritable, and his speech was terse. He appeared distracted but denied confusion and disorientation. He had no delusions or hallucinations. His thoughts were logical and coherent, without disorganization, and there was no latency to his responses. He scored 26 out of 30 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, missing points for recall and serial 7s. He scored in the normal range for Trail Making Test A and B but asked to have the instructions repeated for Trails B.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Clarifying mood disorder codes**\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out the correct ICD-10 code for medication-induced mood disorder. Initially, I thought it might be F06.3, but actually, there\u2019s a specific code for \"Drug-induced mood disorder,\" possibly F06.30. Checking further, F06.30 pertains to mood disorders due to another medical condition. I found that F19.94 might relate better to medication-induced issues. The situation also involves psychiatric symptoms from prednisolone, which can arise quickly and include various effects like euphoria and cognitive impairment.\n\n**Assessing psychiatric symptoms**\n\nI'm analyzing the patient's symptoms, noting a week of euphoria or hypomania followed by anxiety and irritability. It seems like they might be experiencing \"Substance\/Medication-Induced Bipolar and Related Disorder\" with hypomanic features. However, he's feeling anxious now rather than elevated. His initial euphoria suggests possible mania, but the anxiety points to a mixed state. Alternatively, it could relate to alcohol withdrawal, as he stopped drinking after hospitalization. Yet, his anxiety began a week after discharge, which doesn\u2019t fit typical withdrawal patterns.\n\n**Evaluating adjustment and withdrawal issues**\n\nI'm considering the idea of \"protracted withdrawal,\" which can bring anxiety and sleep disturbances over weeks, but DSM criteria for alcohol withdrawal aren't clearly met here. The individual is in a mandatory addiction program and has shown irritability and arguments, suggesting possible \"adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct.\" However, he seems to have anxiety due to stress from health and financial worries, alongside the impact of prednisone and mild cognitive issues related to hepatic disease. It's a complex situation!\n\n**Ranking psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI need to decide on rankings for psychiatric diagnoses. \"Alcohol Use Disorder (F10.20)\" is established and significant for transplant evaluation, but if I\u2019m treating current symptoms, I might consider \u201cSubstance\/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder\u201d or \u201cAdjustment Disorder with Anxiety\u201d as primary. The question asks for a structured list of DSM-5-TR diagnoses, including primary and secondary, without needing to specify a primary reason for the consult. The transplant team is focused on irritability and anxiety within the context of his alcohol use disorder. So, I have to weigh these factors carefully!\n\n**Determining primary psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI need to consider the primary psychiatric diagnosis for a patient who has irritability and anxiety. Possible options include \u201cSubstance\/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder\u201d or \u201cAdjustment Disorder with Anxiety.\u201d Alcohol use disorder is also significant, but I\u2019ll focus on the most relevant symptoms. Additionally, corticosteroids may cause anxiety, suggesting \u201cCorticosteroid-Induced Anxiety Disorder\u201d could fit. I have to create a structured top five diagnoses list, prioritizing those most likely based on the patient\u2019s symptoms and history, including cognitive impairment factors.\n\n**Evaluating diagnosis options**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to include \"Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Intoxication\" due to alprazolam in the top diagnoses list. While cognitive deficits might suggest mild neurocognitive disorder from hepatic encephalopathy, it's plausible that the benzodiazepine contributes more significantly to his symptoms. The patient\u2019s use of low-dose alprazolam and development of lethargy and forgetfulness after a few days supports that idea. I need to ensure the coding aligns with DSM-5 and ICD-10 correctly to avoid inaccuracies in diagnoses.\n\n**Assessing potential diagnoses**\n\nI'm reviewing potential diagnoses for this case. The main focus is on Alcohol Use Disorder (F10.20), which seems definite given the context. Then, I\u2019m considering other possibilities, like Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety (F43.22) and Substance\/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder due to corticosteroids\u2014although I'm uncertain about that code. I might also consider Mild Neurocognitive Disorder due to hepatic impairment, and Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Intoxication (F13.929) because of his experience with alprazolam. I need to ensure these diagnoses are plausible and properly ranked!\n\n**Clarifying psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m really diving into the possible diagnoses for this case. While the mental status exam didn\u2019t show sedation, he does have impaired attention and memory, which raises the possibility of intoxication. Alcohol Use Disorder seems certain (F10.20). I\u2019m also considering Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety (F43.22) and Substance\/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder (F19.980) due to corticosteroids.\n\nI need to ensure I choose the correct codes for everything, including Mild Neurocognitive Disorder (F06.7). So I'll rank these options to get the top five.\n\n**Assessing diagnoses based on symptoms**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the potential diagnoses and considering the initial euphoria transitioning to anxiety, which suggests a steroid-induced mood disorder. Cognitive impairment might be linked to benzodiazepines or hepatic issues, but it's mild.\n\nWhile hypomanic symptoms were present, they don't fully meet the criteria, so I won't classify him as having a bipolar disorder. Instead, I\u2019ll include diagnoses like Alcohol Use Disorder (F10.20), Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety (F43.22), and Substance\/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder (F19.980). I need to double-check the accuracy of these codes, too.\n\n**Determining appropriate diagnoses**\n\nI'm evaluating the patient's anxiety and irritability symptoms, which suggest possible steroid-induced mood issues, but there's no evidence of full mania. Steroid use can lead to mood lability without classic manic symptoms.\n\nI\u2019m ranking possible diagnoses, including Alcohol Use Disorder (F10.20), Substance\/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder due to corticosteroids (F19.980), and Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety (F43.22). The aim is to confirm that the codes accurately reflect the diagnoses, ensuring clarity for the clinical situation at hand and aligning everything with DSM-5 standards.\n\n**Defining the diagnostic codes**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on choosing the correct DSM-5-TR diagnostic name for anxiety symptoms related to corticosteroid use. The best ones would be \u201cSubstance\/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder (corticosteroid-induced)\u201d or \u201cOther Substance\/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder.\u201d I need to ensure that the corresponding ICD-10 codes match, like F19.980 for the unknown substance-induced anxiety. \n\nFor the audit, I\u2019ll ensure I list five diagnoses, considering primary ones for current symptoms like \"Substance\/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder,\" while including relevant secondary options like alcohol use disorder and mild neurocognitive disorder.\n\n**Structuring psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI'm working on listing appropriate DSM-5-TR diagnoses for the case, focusing on the patient's symptoms and their context. The primary diagnosis will likely be \u201cSubstance\/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder (corticosteroid-induced)\u201d with the coding F19.980. Secondary diagnoses will include \u201cAlcohol Use Disorder\u201d (F10.20), \u201cAdjustment Disorder with Anxiety\u201d (F43.22), \u201cSedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Intoxication\u201d (F13.929), and \u201cMild Neurocognitive Disorder due to another medical condition\u201d (F06.7). \n\nI'll ensure that all the codes and names match the specific criteria.\n\n**Deciding on primary diagnoses**\n\nI'm assessing the top diagnoses for a patient with alcohol use disorder and potential medication-induced anxiety. While alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a definite chronic issue, the acute symptoms might be better explained by \u201cSubstance\/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder.\u201d I can think about these conditions: we might also include \u201cAdjustment Disorder with Anxiety\u201d and \u201cMild Neurocognitive Disorder\u201d among others. Based on the current context, I'll ensure the final list strictly adheres to DSM-5-TR terminology and relevant ICD-10 codes for clarity.\n\n**Finalizing diagnostic codes**\n\nI'm concluding the reporting of diagnoses for this case, focusing strictly on the requested ICD-10 codes. The primary diagnosis is \u201cSubstance\/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder\u201d with code F19.980. I\u2019m including \u201cAlcohol Use Disorder, severe\u201d as the second diagnosis, marked as F10.20; third is \u201cAdjustment Disorder with Anxiety\u201d (F43.22). Next is \u201cSedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Intoxication\u201d (F13.929), and finally, \u201cMild Neurocognitive Disorder due to Another Medical Condition\u201d (F06.7). I\u2019ll ensure no extraneous reasoning is included\u2014just the clean list is needed!\n\n**Finalizing diagnostic considerations**\n\nI'm working through the criteria for diagnosing Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). He meets several criteria, leading to a determination of moderate AUD, which corresponds to the code F10.20.

    "vignette":"Peter Winters, a 46-year-old married white minister, was referred to the psychiatry outpatient department by his primary care doctor for depressive symptoms and opioid misuse in the setting of chronic right knee pain.\n\nMr. Winters injured his right knee playing basketball 17 months earlier. His mother gave him several tablets of hydrocodone-acetaminophen that she had for back pain, and he found this helpful. When he ran out of the pills and his pain persisted, he went to the emergency room. He was told he had a mild sprain. He was given a 1-month supply of hydrocodone-acetaminophen. He took the pills as prescribed for 1 month, and his pain resolved.\n\nAfter stopping the pills, however, Mr. Winters began to experience a recurrence of the pain in his knee. He saw an orthopedist, who ordered imaging studies and determined that there was no structural damage. Mr. Winters was given another 1-month supply of hydrocodone-acetaminophen. This time, however, he needed to take more than prescribed in order to ease the pain. He also felt dysphoric and \u201cachy\u201d when he abstained from taking the medication, and described a \u201ccraving\u201d for more opioids. He returned to the orthopedist, who referred him to a pain specialist.\n\nMr. Winters was too embarrassed to go to the pain specialist, believing that his faith and strength should help him overcome the pain. He found it impossible to live without the pain medication, however, because of the pain, dysphoria, and muscle aches when he stopped the medication. He also began to \u201cenjoy the high\u201d and experienced intense craving. He began to frequent emergency rooms to receive more opioids, often lying about the timing and nature of his right knee pain, and even stole pills from his mother on two occasions. He became preoccupied with trying to find more opioids, and his work and home life suffered. He endorsed low mood, especially when contemplating the impact of opioids on his life, but denied any other mood or neurovegetative symptoms. Eventually, he told his primary care doctor about his opioid use and low mood, and that doctor referred him to the outpatient psychiatry clinic.\n\nMr. Winters had a history of two lifetime major depressive episodes that were treated successfully with escitalopram by his primary care doctor. He also had a history of an alcohol use disorder when he was in his 20s. He managed to quit using alcohol on his own after a family intervention. He smoked two packs of cigarettes daily. His father suffered from depression, and \u201calmost everyone\u201d on his mother\u2019s side of the family had \u201cissues with addiction.\u201d He had been married to his wife for 20 years, and they had two school-age children. He had been a minister in his church for 15 years. Results of a recent physical examination and laboratory testing performed by his primary care physician had been within normal limits.\n\nOn mental status examination, Mr. Winters was cooperative and did not exhibit any psychomotor abnormalities. He answered most questions briefly, often simply saying \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d Speech was of a normal rate and tone, without tangentiality or circumstantiality. He reported that his mood was \u201clousy,\u201d and his affect was dysphoric and constricted. He denied symptoms of paranoia or hallucinations. He denied any thoughts of harming himself or others.

    "model_thoughts":"**Considering overlapping diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m weighing the potential diagnoses: 1) Opioid-induced depressive disorder (F11.24) and 2) Major depressive disorder, recurrent (F33.9). This gives me five diagnoses in total, including two mood-related ones, but it feels contradictory. The DSM-5 notes that you wouldn't diagnose a substance-induced disorder if there's already an independent one. Still, if he meets the criteria for both types, we could list MDD as possible. However, I need to focus on providing the requested diagnoses.\n\n**Interpreting diagnosis instructions**\n\nI need to give the top 5 diagnoses with their ICD-10 F-codes, which includes a primary diagnosis and four secondary ones. This effectively means creating a differential list, so I can include less likely diagnoses even if I\u2019m not entirely certain. They've asked for psychiatric diagnoses, implying these should be the most likely. So, I can include Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) due to the patient's history, even as a secondary diagnosis. Other options could be adjustment disorder or unspecified depressive disorder, but I need to limit myself to four secondary diagnoses.\n\n**Formulating diagnoses**\n\nAs a psychiatry resident, I need to include diagnoses like opioid use disorder (OUD) and opioid-induced depressive disorder versus Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The prompt instructs me to use DSM-5-TR diagnoses with F codes and to base my answer on available information and my clinical expertise, without fabricating details. While I can't state he meets full MDD criteria unless there\u2019s clear support, I can include it as a differential diagnosis due to his history. I might list \"Major depressive disorder, recurrent, unspecified\" as less likely but still plausible given his current symptoms. However, I\u2019m tasked with providing a structured list of the top five diagnoses.\n\n**Identifying potential diagnoses**\n\nThe patient definitely has Opioid Use Disorder (OUD), tobacco use disorder, and alcohol use disorder (currently in remission). He likely has a depressive condition, which could be substance-induced or adjustment-related. That's four diagnoses. I need one more; \u201cOpioid withdrawal\u201d or \u201cChronic pain disorder\u201d could fit, and we can consider \"Somatic symptom disorder, with predominant pain\" (F45.1). However, I need more evidence of excessive thoughts or behaviors to support this. He has a history of MDD and presents with low mood and dysphoria, which might suggest \"Opioid-induced depressive disorder,\" possibly occurring during intoxication.\n\n**Finalizing the diagnoses list**\n\nHe seems to be experiencing low mood, indicating possible guilt and demoralization. I\u2019m considering a diagnosis of Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) with opioid-induced depressive disorder as primary. I definitely need to include tobacco use disorder and alcohol use disorder (in remission). For the fifth diagnosis, I might consider opioid withdrawal because he experiences symptoms when abstaining; that aligns with withdrawal criteria. \n\nSo, the final structured list of diagnoses I\u2019ll consider is:\n1. Opioid use disorder, severe (F11.20)\n2. Opioid withdrawal (F11.23)\n3. Opioid-induced depressive disorder (F11.24)\n4. Tobacco use disorder (F17.210)\n5. Alcohol use disorder, in sustained remission (F10.21).\n\n**Choosing the right diagnoses**\n\nI need to finalize the diagnoses list. The primary diagnosis is clearly severe Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). For the secondaries, I\u2019m weighing the options like Substance\/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder and Adjustment Disorder due to the patient's mild depressive symptoms and history of MDD. Given the potential overlap and the need for clarity, I\u2019ll choose:\n\n1. Opioid use disorder, severe - F11.20  \n2. Opioid withdrawal (history\/when abstinent) - F11.23  \n3. Opioid-induced depressive disorder - F11.24  \n4. Tobacco use disorder - F17.210  \n5. Alcohol use disorder, in sustained remission - F10.21  \n\nThis setup should cover all bases without double-coding.\n\n**Refining diagnostic considerations**\n\nI'm evaluating whether to include \"opioid-induced depressive disorder\" or go with \"depressive disorder, unspecified.\" The patient's low mood seems reactive, which complicates things. Given his history and current symptoms, a possible option is \"Other Specified Depressive Disorder\" for insufficient symptoms causing distress. I'm also considering tobacco and alcohol use disorders, as he has a history of both. My final diagnostic list will reflect severity and relevance while aiming for clarity without overlapping too much.  \n\n1. Opioid use disorder, severe - F11.20  \n2. Opioid withdrawal - F11.23  \n3. Depressive disorder, unspecified - F32.9  \n4. Tobacco use disorder - F17.210  \n5. Alcohol use disorder, in sustained remission - F10.21\n\n**Evaluating diagnostic options**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to list \"substance\/medication-induced depressive disorder\" or go with an unspecified depressive disorder. The ICD-10 codes are crucial here, especially for opioid-related conditions. If I choose F11.24, that implies opioid dependence with depressive disorder, but possibly we should focus on \"adjustment disorder with depressed mood\" instead. His symptoms seem more about guilt rather than direct chemical effects. So, a clear primary diagnosis might emerge with \"opioid use disorder, severe, with withdrawal\" to avoid duplicating codes. After that, I\u2019ll compile potential secondary diagnoses.\n\n**Identifying diagnostic considerations**\n\nI\u2019m determining the best way to diagnose this case. It seems he experiences withdrawal symptoms, so coding as F11.23, \u201copioid dependence with withdrawal,\u201d makes sense as a primary diagnosis. Then I\u2019ll need four additional diagnoses. I\u2019m considering options like adjustment disorder or unspecified depressive disorder for the second. For the others, I might include tobacco and alcohol use disorders. I can also note a history of major depressive disorder, possibly in remission, to reflect his past without fabricating information, given he has had two major depressive episodes before.\n\n**Deciding diagnostic codes**\n\nI'm determining the top five psychiatric diagnoses and their corresponding ICD-10 codes for the patient. Given that there's history of major depressive disorder, I could list \u201cMajor depressive disorder, recurrent\" without specifying whether it\u2019s in full remission. I\u2019ll prioritize \"Opioid use disorder, severe\" as the primary diagnosis. The potential secondary diagnoses could include \"Opioid-induced depressive disorder\" and \"tobacco use disorder,\" followed by \"alcohol use disorder in sustained remission.\" I need to finalize this list while adhering to the guidelines provided.\n\n**Finalizing diagnoses and codes**\n\nI'm putting together the top five psychiatric diagnoses and their corresponding ICD-10 codes for the patient. The primary diagnosis will be \u201cOpioid use disorder, severe\u201d coded as F11.20. For secondary diagnoses, I\u2019m considering \"Adjustment disorder with depressed mood\" (F43.21), \"Tobacco use disorder\" (F17.210), \"Alcohol use disorder in sustained remission\" (F10.21), and possibly \"Major depressive disorder, recurrent\" (F33.9). Though there\u2019s a debate on whether opioid withdrawal might be more relevant than recurrent MDD, I want to prioritize what's most clinically significant.\n\n**Clarifying diagnoses and codes**\n\nI'm working on clarifying the top five psychiatric diagnoses and their ICD-10 codes for the patient. The primary diagnosis will be \u201cOpioid use disorder, severe\u201d coded as F11.20. For the secondary diagnoses, I\u2019m considering including \u201cOpioid-induced depressive disorder\u201d (F11.24), \u201cTobacco use disorder\u201d (F17.210), \u201cAlcohol use disorder in sustained remission\u201d (F10.21), and \u201cMajor depressive disorder, recurrent\u201d (F33.9). It\u2019s challenging to balance current symptoms with historical diagnoses, but capturing the nuances is important!\n\n**Finalizing psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m working on the final list of psychiatric diagnoses and their corresponding codes. For the primary diagnosis, I have \u201cOpioid use disorder, severe\u201d (F11.20) and for secondary ones, I'm considering \u201cOpioid withdrawal\u201d (F11.23), \u201cOther specified depressive disorder\u201d (F32.8), \u201cTobacco use disorder\u201d (F17.210), and \u201cAlcohol use disorder in sustained remission\u201d (F10.21). I'm trying to balance current symptoms with historical conditions, but clarity and accuracy here are key. Also, I think \u201cOther specified depressive disorder\u201d fits better than \u201cAdjustment disorder\u201d given the context.\n\n**Creating a structured diagnosis list**\n\nI'm working on crafting the top 5 most likely psychiatric diagnoses based on the case vignette. I think the primary diagnosis should be \"Opioid use disorder, severe\" (F11.20). For secondary diagnoses, I\u2019m considering \u201cOpioid withdrawal\u201d (F11.23), \u201cAdjustment disorder with depressed mood\u201d (F43.21), \u201cTobacco use disorder\u201d (F17.210), and \u201cAlcohol use disorder in sustained remission\u201d (F10.21). I find including \"Major depressive disorder, recurrent\" plausible due to the history, potentially reflecting partial remission. But I need to ensure we only reflect 5 accurate diagnoses.\n\n**Finalizing the diagnosis list**\n\nI'm deciding on the most appropriate psychiatric diagnoses based on the information provided. My primary choice is \"Opioid use disorder, severe.\" For the secondary diagnoses, I'm considering \"Major depressive disorder, recurrent,\" \"Tobacco use disorder,\" and \"Alcohol use disorder in sustained remission.\" I could also include \"Opioid withdrawal,\" but I need to prioritize the most relevant conditions. Given his symptoms, I might also consider \"Other specified depressive disorder\" as it reflects his current state better, rather than labeling it as substance-induced. Balancing these options is tricky!\n\n**Deciding on diagnoses**\n\nI'm weighing the most relevant psychiatric diagnoses for the case. It seems we can include \"Opioid use disorder, severe\" and \"Major depressive disorder, recurrent, in partial remission.\" I need to consider whether to include \"Opioid withdrawal,\" \"Tobacco use disorder,\" or \"Alcohol use disorder in sustained remission.\" Each diagnosis carries weight, so I need to balance them well. The goal is to incorporate current symptoms while recognizing historical ones. The final five include OUD, MDD recurrent, and possibly others based on the context. Tricky choices!\n\n**Clarifying diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m sorting through the psychiatric diagnoses for this case, focusing on \"Opioid use disorder, severe\" and \"Major depressive disorder, recurrent, in partial remission.\" It gets tricky when considering withdrawal symptoms and past depressive episodes. The interaction between opioid use and depressive symptoms complicates whether to classify them as partial remission or something else like \"Other specified depressive disorder.\" Ultimately, I need to provide a structured list of five diagnoses, each with precise codes that align with DSM-5-TR guidelines. Balancing accuracy with simplicity is crucial.\n\n**Deciding on diagnoses**\n\nI'm weighing options for listing the diagnoses in this case. One idea is to use \"Opioid use disorder, severe with withdrawal\" as F11.23 and avoid duplication. I\u2019ve outlined several options that capture various aspects\u2014like including both opioid-induced depressive disorder and recurrent major depressive disorder. It seems essential to ensure that the list fits the criteria of being distinct yet relevant to the client's history and current situation. I want to make sure we adhere to what\u2019s permissible in the guidelines and ensure clarity in our final choices.\n\n**Clarifying diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m working through how the DSM-5 and ICD codes relate, especially since the DSM removed the distinction between abuse and dependence. For our purposes, since the patient has severe OUD, I\u2019ll use F11.24 for opioid dependence with induced mood disorder. However, I need to ensure that the list includes a primary diagnosis and four secondary ones. My goal is to choose coexisting conditions like tobacco use disorder, alcohol in remission, and possibly opioid withdrawal while keeping it clear and manageable.",

    "vignette":"The patient is an 18-year-old non-binary college freshman with a complex psychiatric presentation. They report a history of childhood anxiety, perfectionism, and ritualistic self-punishment behaviors starting in the third grade. Currently, their most debilitating symptom is anxiety about \"contaminated air\" when others cough or sneeze, prompting them to cover their face and hold their breath even when the trigger is far away or on television. They engage in checking and counting behaviors based on the number 3, including checking mirrors while driving, locking\/unlocking their car, and tapping their toothbrush. These compulsions are experienced as uncontrollable, with the patient reporting they sometimes modify behaviors (like holding an imaginary door handle in their pocket) when the original compulsion would be disruptive. At approximately age 16, the patient developed anorexia nervosa, restricting their food intake and ultimately requiring intervention from parents and a treatment team. Despite gaining weight under external pressure, the patient continues to restrict eating, has a distinct fear of gaining weight, becoming fat, fasting until dinner, drinking coffee to intentionally upset their stomach. Their BMI currently falls within the normal range. Around the same time their eating disorder developed, the patient experienced depressive symptoms including hopelessness, low motivation, and self-harm behaviors (pulling hair, cutting, punching stomach). They had suicidal ideation during high school, including thoughts of jumping in front of a train and fantasizing about wandering into hallways during a school shooting. Current suicidal thoughts are less frequent and persistent. Current depressive symptoms have been subsyndromal (though not entirely absent) for about 7 months. Specifically, the patient currently denies experiencing depressive symptoms for more than a few hours every couple of weeks but rates their chance of self-harm in the next three months at 50% (suicide attempt chance at 0%). They report minimal alcohol and marijuana use. Notably, the patient expresses resistance to treatment, stating that \"getting better means getting fat\" and feeling they need to \"stay sad for a while longer\".",

It seems wise to choose F50.01 with the partial remission specifier.

I\u2019m thinking about trying \"Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood\" due to college, but symptoms are chronic. I can\u2019t include Z codes either, so I need to think it through some more.\n\n**Choosing additional diagnoses**\n\nI need to think about additional comorbidities or possible rule-outs.

    "model_thoughts":"**Analyzing diagnoses**\n\nI'm reading that the inquiry suggests a focus on differential diagnoses since they ask for the top 5 most likely ones. I should consider providing one primary and four secondary diagnoses. Now, including Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with and without psychotic features could feel redundant, but it might reveal uncertainty around psychosis. While she denies unusual thoughts, stating something like \"deaths of thousands of dogs\" seems improbable but might not be a delusion. It suggests potential exaggeration or guilt, so I could list both variations of MDD.\n\n**Evaluating differential diagnoses**\n\nOkay, in determining the differential diagnosis, it seems I can start with \"Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, severe, with psychotic features\" as my primary. For the second one, I thought about \"Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, severe, with anxious distress,\" but I can't code it separately, so I need to rethink that. \n\nHmm, \"Alcohol use disorder, mild\" could work since she increased her wine intake before bed. However, after checking the criteria, it looks like she doesn\u2019t meet several symptoms for that either. So, it's likely not applicable.\n\n**Finalizing likely diagnoses**\n\nI considered \"Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder,\" but it doesn't apply here.

But since we can\u2019t include anything that requires more information than we have, I\u2019ll focus on plausible options and list them without reasoning. For instance, Bipolar I seems less likely due to the lack of prior mania or hypomania history.\n\n**Determining top diagnoses**\n\nI'm considering the plausibility of including various diagnoses. Schizoaffective Disorder is less likely due to mood-congruent psychotic features. As I compile the top five, I think \"Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, severe, with psychotic features\" should be my primary choice. \n\nFor the second, \"Delusional Disorder\" fits well.

    "model_thoughts":"**Clarifying mental disorder codes**\n\nI need to check memory about the DSM-5 coding. For catatonia associated with another mental disorder, they mention coding first the associated disorder, then using code 293.89 (F06.1) for catatonia associated with it. For unspecified catatonia, it\u2019s 298.89 (F06.1), which might relate to specified schizophrenia, though I\u2019m a bit uncertain about that. I should aim to list five likely diagnoses with their F-codes, including major depressive disorder and catatonia as separate diagnoses.\n\n**Structuring psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI see that the request is for a structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses, and I\u2019m considering if I can list catatonia as the primary diagnosis. \"Catatonia associated with major depressive disorder\" is F06.1, which fits since it applies to catatonic disorder or its specifier. But I need to determine the most likely diagnosis based on her acute symptoms like immobility, negativity, and signs of catatonia, all while noting her history of major depressive disorder. Evaluating the details is crucial here.\n\n**Crafting psychiatric differential diagnoses**\n\nThe patient previously functioned well in her career and family life but now is presenting with catatonia at age 36. There are no signs of hallucinations or delusions, and her mutism limits assessment. However, her earlier odd behavior might hint at psychosis. Given her history of major depressive disorder, it seems she\u2019s likely experiencing a severe depressive episode with catatonia. I\u2019m considering both diagnoses for the list while also exploring options like schizoaffective disorder, aiming to finalize the top five for the differential.\n\n**Selecting psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m considering listing \"Catatonia associated with another mental disorder\" (F06.1) separately. Next, I thought of \"Schizophrenia spectrum disorder with catatonia\" (F20.9), but I'm unsure if there's enough data to support that. I also considered \"Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type\" (F25.1). Then there's \"Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum\" or \"Brief psychotic disorder,\" but I\u2019m questioning the catatonia relation there. Since there's no history of mania or substance use, I need to select the top five plausible diagnoses based on the information available.\n\n**Selecting structured psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m refining my approach to determine the top diagnoses for this case. The primary diagnosis could be \"Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe, with catatonic features\" (F33.2). I feel it\u2019s also important to recognize \"Catatonia associated with another mental disorder\" (F06.1) as a secondary diagnosis, even if it seems redundant since I can only list five. Other considerations might include \"Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type\" or \"Schizophrenia spectrum disorder with catatonia,\" though I need to be careful about the lack of psychotic symptoms. It's tricky to prioritize and avoid overlaps.\n\n**Organizing psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m working to finalize the top diagnoses for this case. It looks like the primary could be \"Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe, with catatonic features\" (F33.2). For the secondaries, I\u2019m considering \"Catatonia associated with another mental disorder\" (F06.1), \"Schizophrenia\" (F20.9), \"Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type\" (F25.1), and potentially \"Bipolar I disorder, current episode depressed, severe\" (F31.4). While I want to be careful about avoiding duplicates, it's essential to maintain accurate coding and ensure I'm complying with all requirements.\n\n**Refining psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI'm determining the top diagnoses for this case. I think the primary should be \"Catatonia associated with major depressive disorder\" along with the F-code. For secondary diagnoses, I'm considering \"Bipolar I disorder, current episode depressed, severe\" (F31.4), \"Schizophreniform disorder\" (F20.81), \"Other specified schizophrenia spectrum\" (F28), and potentially \"Unspecified catatonia\" (F06.1). I want to avoid duplicates while ensuring accurate coding to comply with the user\u2019s request for structured diagnoses and corresponding ICD-10 F-codes.\n\n**Determining psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI'm analyzing the vignette, which suggests catatonia features like mutism, posturing, and stupor. Given the patient's history of major depressive disorder, the primary diagnosis might be \"Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe, with catatonic features\" (F33.2). For secondary diagnoses, I could consider \"Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition\" (F06.1), \"Schizophrenia\" (F20.9), \"Bipolar I disorder, current episode depressed, severe\" (F31.4), and \"Brief psychotic disorder\" (F23). I want to ensure my final list has unique codes while accurately capturing the diagnosis.\n\n**Clarifying catatonia and diagnostic criteria**\n\nIn this case, catatonia is a key feature\u2014she exhibits symptoms like mutism and stupor. Given her history of major depressive disorder (MDD), it's tempting to diagnose this as \"MDD with catatonic features.\" Yet, without explicit depressive symptoms, we might not fulfill all criteria for MDD. Instead, it may be more appropriate to code her as \"Unspecified catatonia\" (F06.1) for now, recognizing the possibility of MDD as a secondary diagnosis but acknowledging that we can't confirm her current mood state or symptoms without more evidence from the vignette.\n\n**Structuring catatonia diagnoses**\n\nHere\u2019s my plan: I\u2019ll start with \"Unspecified catatonia\" (F06.1) as it fits the evidence. For the secondary diagnoses, I\u2019m considering \"Major depressive disorder, recurrent, unspecified\" (F33.9). Next, \"Schizophrenia spectrum disorder\" (F29) could be plausible due to the bizarre behavior and catatonia. Then, there's \"Bipolar I disorder, unspecified\" (F31.9) for consideration. I want to ensure no duplicates with my final list, focusing on the most likely diagnoses based on available information.\n\n**Identifying top diagnoses**\n\nFirst, I need to ensure the primary diagnosis reflects the most likely condition. I could go with \"Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe, with catatonic features\" (F33.2). Next, for secondary diagnoses, I should include \"Catatonia associated with another mental disorder\" (F06.1), \"Schizophrenia\" (F20.9), \"Bipolar I disorder, current episode depressed, severe\" (F31.4), and \"Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type\" (F25.1). I'll make sure to format these clearly while avoiding redundancy and ensure they comply with DSM-5-TR.\n\n**Determining psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to code the major depressive episode with catatonia. I believe \"Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe, with catatonic features\" (F33.2) is accurate. I'll also list \"Catatonia associated with another mental disorder\" (F06.1). For secondary diagnoses, I can focus on catatonia's relationship to other disorders and include schizophrenia spectrum (F20.9) and bipolar I disorder (F31.4), along with a possible catatonic disorder. Ultimately, I\u2019ll focus on five clear diagnoses with their respective codes for clarity.\n\n**Finalizing psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m working on listing the psychiatric diagnoses for the patient, ensuring I avoid duplicates while staying accurate. I think the primary diagnosis should be \"Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, severe, with catatonic features\" - F33.2. For the secondary diagnoses, I\u2019ll include \"Catatonia associated with another mental disorder\" - F06.1, \"Schizophreniform disorder\" - F20.81, \"Bipolar I disorder, current episode depressed, severe\" - F31.4, and \"Brief psychotic disorder\" - F23. This gives a comprehensive view while reflecting the patient's symptoms correctly.\n\n**Choosing psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI'm working on finalizing the top 5 psychiatric diagnoses for this case. I think the primary should be \"Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe, with catatonic features\" - F33.2. For secondary diagnoses, I'd include \"Catatonia associated with another mental disorder\" - F06.1, \"Schizophrenia\" - F20.9, \"Bipolar I disorder, current episode depressed, severe\" - F31.4, and then perhaps \"Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type\" - F25.1. This way, I can create unique codes while addressing the important considerations around catatonia.\n\n**Finalizing differential diagnoses**\n\nI'm considering the potential differential diagnoses for this case, focusing on the most relevant ones. I think \"Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition\" - F06.1 is essential to rule out. Then, I\u2019m looking at \"Schizophrenia\" - F20.9 and \"Bipolar I disorder, current episode depressed, severe\" - F31.4 as possible options. \"Brief psychotic disorder\" - F23 might also fit. It's tricky to determine which of these should be prioritized, but I want to ensure I\u2019m covering all potential diagnoses accurately.\n\n**Deciding on diagnoses**\n\nI'm working on finalizing the differential diagnoses. We're including \"Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode, severe, with catatonic features\" - F33.2, as our primary. Then, I\u2019m considering \u201cSchizophrenia (with catatonia)\" - F20.9 and \"Bipolar I disorder, current episode depressed, severe\" - F31.4 as possible secondaries. I want to include \"Brief psychotic disorder\" - F23 and possibly \"Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition\" - F06.1. It's challenging because I need to balance between unique codes and keeping everything accurate while ensuring we're clear on the potential diagnoses.\n\n**Finalizing differential diagnoses**\n\nI'm considering the top five differential diagnoses based on catatonic behavior and the patient's history. The primary diagnosis could be \"Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode, severe, with catatonic features\" - F33.2. For secondaries, I might include \"Catatonia associated with another mental disorder\" - F06.1, \"Schizophrenia\" - F20.9, and \"Bipolar I disorder\" - F31.4. I also think about potential alternatives like \"Persistent depressive disorder\" - F34.1 or \"Brief psychotic disorder\" - F23, but I\u2019m unsure if there's enough evidence to justify those.\n\n**Deciding on primary diagnosis**\n\nI\u2019m thinking it makes sense to use \"Catatonia associated with major depressive disorder\" as the primary diagnosis because it captures the key clinical presentation. However, MDD must also be explicitly included as a secondary condition. For a structured list, I could go with:  \n\n1. Catatonia associated with another mental disorder (likely MDD) - F06.1  \n2. Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode, severe - F33.2  \n3. Schizophrenia - F20.9  \n4. Bipolar I disorder, current episode depressed, severe - F31.4  \n5. Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type - F25.1  \n\nIt's tough to determine the best diagnosis without full details, especially concerning psychosis and the timeline.\n\n**Finalizing psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI'm deciding on a clear list of psychiatric diagnoses while keeping in mind the importance of uniqueness in coding. I want to include \"Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe, with catatonic features\" as the primary diagnosis. For the secondary diagnoses, I will include \"Catatonia associated with another mental disorder,\" \"Bipolar I disorder, current episode depressed, severe,\" \"Schizophreniform disorder,\" and \"Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type.\" However, I\u2019m still evaluating whether to replace one diagnosis to avoid duplicate codes, especially regarding catatonia. Balancing these factors is tricky!\n\n**Organizing psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m figuring out the right list of psychiatric diagnoses, particularly focusing on ensuring no duplicates in the F-codes. It looks like I need to include \"Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode, severe, with catatonic features\" as the primary diagnosis. For the secondaries, I\u2019ll have \"Catatonia associated with another mental disorder,\" \"Schizophrenia,\" \"Bipolar I disorder, current episode depressed, severe,\" and \"Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type.\" This gives me a solid set while balancing the constraints of unique codes!\n\n**Deciding on primary diagnosis**\n\nI\u2019m contemplating the best primary diagnosis for this case. If I go with \"Major depressive disorder with catatonic features,\" it highlights the underlying cause. However, for a more nuanced approach, I might consider \"Catatonia associated with another mental disorder\" as primary. Since the vignette points to catatonic signs in the patient\u2019s behavior, it feels right to list that as primary. Ultimately, I\u2019ll finalize my structured list with the correct DSM-5 names and codes.",

    "vignette":"Nadine was a 15-year-old girl whose mother brought her for a psychiatric evaluation to help with her long-standing shyness.\n\nAlthough Nadine was initially reluctant to say much about herself, she said she felt constantly tense. She added that the anxiety had been \u201creally bad\u201d for several years and was often accompanied by episodes of dizziness and crying. She was generally unable to speak in any situation outside of her home or school classes. She refused to leave her house alone for fear of being forced to interact with someone. She was especially anxious around other teenagers, but she had also become \u201ctoo nervous\u201d to speak to adult neighbors she had known for years. She said it felt impossible to walk into a restaurant and order from \u201ca stranger at the counter\u201d for fear of being humiliated. She also felt constantly on her guard, needing to avoid the possibility of getting attacked, a strategy that really only worked when she was alone in her home.\n\nNadine tried to conceal her crippling anxiety from her parents, typically telling them that she \u201cjust didn\u2019t feel like\u201d going out. Feeling trapped and incompetent, Nadine said she contemplated suicide \u201call the time.\u201d In the month before her mother finally brought her in for a psychiatric evaluation, Nadine had begun to cut herself on her thighs to \u201cfeel pain and relieve stress.\u201d No one in the family was aware of this development.\n\nNadine had always been \u201cshy\u201d and had been teased at recess since she started kindergarten. The teasing had escalated to outright bullying by the time she was in seventh grade. The bullying took on a cultural\/racially motivated undertone; Nadine and her family were of a different ethnicity than the vast majority of her schoolmates. For 2 years, day after difficult day, Nadine\u2019s peers turned on her \u201clike a snarling wolf pack,\u201d calling her \u201cstupid,\u201d \u201cugly,\u201d and \u201ccrazy.\u201d Not infrequently, one of them would stare at her and tell her she would be better off committing suicide. One girl (the ringleader, as well as a former elementary school chum) hit Nadine on one occasion, giving her a black eye. Nadine did not fight back. This event was witnessed by an adult neighbor, who told Nadine\u2019s mother. When Nadine\u2019s mother asked her about the incident, Nadine denied it, saying she had \u201cfallen\u201d on the street. She did, however, mention to her mother \u201cin passing\u201d that she wanted to switch schools, but her delivery was so offhand that at the time, her mother casually advised against the switch. Nadine suffered on, sobbing herself to sleep most nights and wishing that she would not wake up.\n\nFull of hope and ideas of escape from the bullies and their narrowness, Nadine transferred to a specialty arts high school for ninth grade. Although the bullying ceased, her anxiety symptoms paradoxically worsened. She felt even more unable to venture into public spaces and felt increasingly embarrassed by her inability to develop the sort of independence typical of a 15-year-old. She said she had begun to spend whole weekends \u201ctrapped\u201d in her home and had become scared to even read by herself in the local park. Nadine\u2019s social anxiety had evolved into true agoraphobia. She had nightly nightmares about the bullies in her old school. Her preoccupation with suicide grew.\n\nHer parents had thought she would outgrow being shy and sought psychiatric help for her only after a teacher remarked that her anxiety and social isolation were keeping her from making the sort of grades and doing the sort of extracurricular activities that were necessary to get into a good college.\n\nNadine described her mother as loud, excitable, aggressive, and \u201ca little frightening.\u201d Her father was a successful tax attorney who worked long hours. Nadine described him as shy in social situations (\u201cHe\u2019s more like me\u201d). Nadine said she and her father sometimes joked that the goal of any evening was to avoid tipping the mother into a rage. Nadine added that she \u201cnever wanted to be anything like her mother.\u201d",

    "model_thoughts":"**Compiling diagnoses list**\n\nI need to list the diagnoses and codes clearly, without reasoning. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve crafted:  \n\n1. Social Anxiety Disorder (generalized) - F40.11  \n2. Agoraphobia - F40.00  \n3. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder - F43.10  \n4. Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) - F34.1  \n5. Selective Mutism - F94.0  \n\nI\u2019m wondering about selective mutism in adolescence and the possibility of unspecified depressive disorder (F32.A). Given the severe suicidality mentioned, it might lean more towards major depressive disorder (MDD).\n\n**Assessing depressive diagnoses**\n\nI'm considering the best diagnosis for depression. \"Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, severe, without psychotic features\" (F32.2) comes to mind, but I'm unsure about severity. Alternatively, I could go with \"Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, unspecified\" (F32.9). Given that we need the top five likely diagnoses and there's clinical suspicion due to suicidal ideation, it's crucial to avoid fabricating details. Maybe it's safer to include \"Unspecified Depressive Disorder\" instead, as expert reasoning leans towards that when criteria aren't met.\n\n**Considering PTSD and diagnoses**\n\nFor PTSD, I realize we might not confirm all criteria, but it could still be a likely diagnosis. The goal is to provide the top five most plausible diagnoses based on available data, with DSM-5-TR F-codes. Social anxiety and agoraphobia are clear contenders; selective mutism and PTSD might fit too. With selective mutism, she doesn't speak in certain social situations, which aligns with the criteria. But I need to ensure all choices reflect what's feasible based on her circumstances.\n\n**Evaluating selective mutism and anxiety**\n\nShe speaks in school classes, but may struggle with speaking outside of that setting. There\u2019s an expectation to communicate with peers and teachers, and she might not even talk to familiar adult neighbors or order at restaurants. This could indicate selective mutism, but it shouldn\u2019t be explained by a communication disorder, and there's a potential for extreme social anxiety here. However, selective mutism typically relates to early childhood. I might consider including \"Generalized Anxiety Disorder\" instead of selective mutism as the fifth diagnosis since that could fit better.\n\n**Finalizing diagnoses and codes**\n\nI'm working on the final list of diagnoses and corresponding F-codes based on the evidence provided. The individual's behaviors suggest important considerations, especially regarding anxiety and trauma:\n\n1. Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia), generalized - F40.11  \n2. Agoraphobia - F40.00  \n3. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder - F43.10  \n4. Unspecified Depressive Disorder - F32.A  \n5. Selective Mutism - F94.0  \n\nI\u2019m weighing whether to include \"Generalized Anxiety Disorder\" instead of selective mutism, but I've opted to keep selective mutism at this point.\n\n**Determining diagnoses and codes**\n\nI'm considering the inclusion of selective mutism based on her speaking difficulties, but is it consistent? She struggles to speak outside of home and school classes, which suggests a specific failure to communicate. Her anxiety has lasted several years and impacts her daily functioning. While she may not be mute, her inability to speak could stem from social phobia or severe social anxiety. \n\nI need to confirm that all diagnoses align with DSM-5-TR standards and clarify the appropriate ICD-10 F-code for unspecified depressive disorder. There are several codes, including F32.9 and F32.A, to sort through. F32.A seems to correspond with unspecific depressive disorder, which many clinicians may prefer due to insurance recognition. I'm still double-checking this connection.\n\n**Clarifying diagnosis codes**\n\nI\u2019m checking the DSM-5 regarding social anxiety disorder, which has the code F40.10. There\u2019s also a performance-only specifier. I\u2019m not sure if ICD-10-CM's F40.11 for generalized social phobia aligns well since DSM-5 doesn't include a generalized specifier. It's tricky because while DSM-5 uses F40.10, F40.11 might still be applicable for billing purposes. However, I understand there\u2019s a difference between \"social phobia\" and \"social anxiety disorder,\" even if they often mean the same thing.\n\n**Finalizing diagnosis codes**\n\nIn ICD-10-CM, F40.10 is for unspecified social phobia, while F40.11 is for generalized social phobia, and F40.12 is for performance-related issues. Since we're dealing with generalized anxiety, I'll use F40.11. For PTSD, it\u2019s F43.10, which is unspecified. Then for persistent depressive disorder, it's F34.1, and selective mutism is F94.0. \n\nSo, the final output will look like this:\n1. Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia) - F40.11\n2. Agoraphobia - F40.00\n3. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder - F43.10\n4. Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) - F34.1\n5. Selective Mutism - F94.0\n\nI want to make sure to clarify the labels without mudding the waters with unnecessary details.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Considering diagnoses and codes**\n\nI need to provide the top five most likely diagnoses along with their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes. I assume the user wants a differential, so I\u2019ll start with the primary diagnosis as the most likely and then suggest four plausible secondary diagnoses. First, I'll use anorexia nervosa, restricting type - F50.01. The second could be other specified feeding or eating disorder, atypical anorexia nervosa - F50.89. Next, I'll consider anorexia nervosa, binge-eating\/purging type - F50.02. Lastly, I'll include avoidant\/restrictive food intake disorder - F50.82.\n\n**Identifying additional diagnoses**\n\nI'm considering that the user might be looking at ARFID (avoidant\/restrictive food intake disorder) since excessive exercise and calorie counting imply a focus on weight\/shape rather than just sensory issues. I'll categorize this under F50.82. Another option is unspecified feeding or eating disorder - F50.9. I\u2019m also thinking about bulimia nervosa - F50.2, but I see there's confusion with subtypes. Since there aren't binge episodes, bulimia doesn't seem likely. I wonder if obsessive-compulsive disorder should be included, but we lack typical compulsions aside from food and exercise rules.\n\n**Deciding on diagnoses**\n\nI'm considering traits of obsessive-compulsive disorder, but at age 16, it might lean more toward obsessive-compulsive personality disorder\u2014I'm not certain. I think it's better to focus on eating disorders. I also ponder unspecified anxiety disorder or major depressive disorder, but she denies those symptoms. So, I\u2019ll outline the top five likely diagnoses: anorexia nervosa restricting type, binge-eating\/purging type, OSFED atypical anorexia, OSFED purging disorder, ARFID, and unspecified feeding\/eating disorder. We need to narrow this down to four secondary diagnoses based on the information we have.\n\n**Evaluating primary diagnosis**\n\nI'm pondering whether the primary diagnosis should be anorexia nervosa, binge-eating\/purging type, since laxative use qualifies as purging. However, extreme exercise plays a role too. Typical features include significantly low body weight and fear of gaining weight, which we don\u2019t have data for. Still, the caloric target is under 1000 calories, and daily exercise is 2.5 hours\u2014signs of weight preoccupation. Given her intake control and missed periods, I lean towards either anorexia nervosa, restricting type or binge-eating\/purging type as the primary diagnosis.\n\n**Crafting final list of diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m considering that laxative use could imply misuse related to weight control, but she mentions constipation. If she uses them every morning and night, there\u2019s a chance it could still be misuse. While anorexia nervosa, binge-eating\/purging type could be included, it might be more cautious to opt for distinct diagnoses. I\u2019ll develop the final list with unique codes: 1. Anorexia nervosa, restricting type - F50.01. 2. Anorexia nervosa, binge-eating\/purging type - F50.02. 3. OSFED atypical anorexia - F50.89. 4. Unspecified eating disorder - F50.9. Lastly, I can add bulimia nervosa - F50.2, even though it\u2019s less likely, providing a rounded perspective.\n\n**Building differential diagnoses**\n\nAs I'm analyzing the clinical case, I need to consider the symptoms provided. The vignette suggests severe restriction, laxative use, and amenorrhea, which typically align with anorexia nervosa. I\u2019m leaning towards \"Anorexia nervosa, binge-eating\/purging type\" primarily due to laxative use. Acknowledging that we need distinct diagnoses, I'll outline the top five: \n\n1. Anorexia nervosa, binge-eating\/purging type - F50.02\n2. Anorexia nervosa, restricting type - F50.01\n3. Other specified feeding or eating disorder (atypical anorexia) - F50.89\n4. Bulimia nervosa - F50.2 \n5. Unspecified feeding or eating disorder - F50.9 \n\nThis structure captures the likely scenarios accurately.\n\n**Formulating differential diagnoses**\n\nI'm considering the patient's severe restriction, amenorrhea, and laxative use. These symptoms suggest anorexia nervosa, but we lack weight details. If she's not underweight, purging disorder could fit. However, the absence of binge eating complicates this. The missed periods indicate a potential energy deficit consistent with athletes, which might lead us to \"Other specified feeding or eating disorder (atypical anorexia nervosa)\" as primary.\n\nFor the final diagnoses:  \n1. Anorexia nervosa, binge-eating\/purging type - F50.02  \n2. Anorexia nervosa, restricting type - F50.01  \n3. Other specified feeding or eating disorder (atypical anorexia) - F50.89  \n4. Bulimia nervosa - F50.2  \n5. Unspecified feeding or eating disorder - F50.9\n\n**Listing diagnoses and codes**\n\nI need to finalize the list of likely diagnoses while ensuring we stick to exactly five lines with appropriate formatting. \n\n1. Anorexia nervosa, binge-eating\/purging type - F50.02  \n2. Anorexia nervosa, restricting type - F50.01  \n3. Other specified feeding or eating disorder (atypical anorexia nervosa) - F50.89  \n4.

    "vignette":"Ursula Norman, a 32-year-old nurse, was brought to an emergency department 6 days after giving birth. Her husband stated that she had been behaving very strangely and that she had become convinced that she had smothered and killed her baby.\n\nHer husband reported that after a normal pregnancy and uncomplicated delivery, Ms. Norman had happily gone home with their first child. On the third day after delivery, however, her mood and affect began to shift rapidly between elation and weepiness. She became irritable and anxious. She slept only an hour a night, even when her baby was asleep. Her behavior became increasingly bizarre, with overactivity and agitation. Her speech was rapid and digressive. Although not previously a religious person, she became convinced that God was speaking through her and that she had special powers that could solve the problems of the world. She told her husband that she could identify evil people by looking into their eyes and had begun to worry that she was surrounded by evil people, including her own mother. Most disturbing for her, whenever she was out of sight of her son, she became totally convinced that she had smothered him, and no one could convince her otherwise.\n\nMs. Norman had a history of three episodes of major depressive disorder in her teens and early 20s. These episodes resolved with psychotherapy and antidepressant medication. She also had a psychiatric admission for mania 3 years prior to the delivery of her child, after a flight from Asia to Europe. Following treatment with antipsychotic medication, she became depressed for several months. Although a diagnosis of bipolar disorder was discussed at this time, she was reluctant to accept this label, attributing the episode to stress and jet lag. She had discontinued the psychiatric medication in anticipation of getting pregnant.\n\nMs. Norman\u2019s own mother had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital shortly after the birth of her first child. This episode was not talked about in the family, and there were few other details. She had no other family history of note.\n\nUntil just before delivery of her child, Ms. Norman had been a highly functional nurse in a renal unit. Her husband was the head of a sales team, and they lived in comfortable social circumstances. She had no history of illicit drug use and, prior to pregnancy, drank only 2 or 3 units of alcohol a week.\n\nOn mental status examination, Ms. Norman wandered around the room, seemingly unable to sit for more than a few moments. She was distractible and overtalkative, and demonstrated flight of ideas, flitting from one subject to another. Her mood was labile. At times she appeared happily euphoric. At other times she was tearful, and she could become quickly irritable when she felt she was not being understood. It was clear that she had a number of delusional beliefs but was unwilling to discuss most of them with the examiner. She did insist that she had already killed her own child, which led to several minutes of tears, but she returned to an edgy euphoria within a few minutes. She denied intent to harm herself or anyone else. She appeared inattentive, with poor concentration, but would not participate in formal cognitive testing.\n\nPhysical examination and laboratory testing results were all within normal limits.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Considering bipolar disorder classifications**\n\nI\u2019m looking at whether to list \"Bipolar I disorder\" instead of \"Bipolar affective disorder,\" with DSM code F31.2. I also want to factor in that \"Bipolar I disorder, manic episode with psychotic features and peripartum onset\" might be primary. The secondary could be \"Bipolar I disorder, manic episode with mixed features and psychotic features,\" but I'm hesitant to include too many other disorders. I have to consider top possibilities, like obsessive-compulsive disorder, but it might be less likely given the presence of mania and delusions.\n\n**Evaluating psychiatric possibilities**\n\nI need to think carefully about the situation. The patient has a delusion about smothering the baby, which raises concerns about infanticide and suicide if postpartum psychosis is involved. I\u2019m considering \"Bipolar I disorder\" with possible rapid cycling, but the timeline doesn\u2019t fit. Other specified bipolar disorders might not apply either. Another plausible diagnosis could be \"Bipolar I disorder, current manic episode with psychotic features,\" while postpartum psychosis might be conceptually viewed as \"other specified schizophrenia spectrum,\u201d though DSM lacks that exact term. Brief psychotic disorder seems less likely compared to bipolar disorder.\n\n**Analyzing diagnostic options**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether \"Schizophrenia\" fits, but mania features with postpartum onset make it unlikely. Alternatively, \"Unspecified bipolar and related disorder\" might apply if there's insufficient info about the length of mania. However, her mania symptoms began on day three postpartum, and now it's day six, so they last three days. Mania needs to last at least a week unless hospitalization is required. Since she\u2019s in the ED and may require hospitalization due to severity and psychosis, a mania diagnosis is plausible based on those criteria.\n\n**Considering hospitalization criteria**\n\nI'm weighing the nuances of postpartum mania with psychosis, which has lasted 3-6 days and may not meet the one-week requirement for diagnosis. However, the severity of her symptoms suggests she likely needs hospitalization. I'm contemplating whether to classify this as \"Bipolar I disorder, current episode with mixed features,\" although it's not required. I need to stick to the information provided and my clinical expertise, ensuring I don't fabricate details. Since she may require hospitalization, it seems reasonable to treat it as mania given the severe psychotic features.\n\n**Identifying potential diagnoses**\n\nI'm exploring possible diagnoses for the patient. Postpartum mania with psychosis could suggest \"Bipolar I disorder\" as primary, potentially with mixed features. For secondary diagnoses, I'm considering various differentials like \"Major depressive disorder with psychotic features\" and \"Brief psychotic disorder postpartum.\" Physical examinations show no medical causes, but I could include \"Psychotic disorder due to known physiological condition\" for completeness. Overall, I need to stick to what's most likely, which focuses on established primary and potential differential diagnoses for her acute situation.\n\n**Ranking possible diagnoses**\n\nI need to rank the top 5 diagnoses by probability. First, \"Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features, with peripartum onset\" seems most likely. Second could be \"Brief psychotic disorder with postpartum onset,\" which ranks moderately. Third, I might consider \"Major depressive disorder with psychotic features, peripartum onset,\" but it feels lower due to absence of depression. Fourth could be \"Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type,\" but the prior mood episodes complicate it. Lastly, \"Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder\" could be my fifth since the features lean more towards mania.",

    "vignette":"A 16-year-old boy with no history of psychiatric illness in self or family and no psychoactive substance use presented with a seizure disorder of 5 years' duration. The semiology of the seizure was such that there would be an aura-tingling sensation in limbs, ringing in ears, and fearfulness for less than a minute, followed by focal onset seizure-twisting of the upper limb and head toward left with stiffening and jerky movements of all four limbs with unconsciousness associated with tongue bite, injury due to fall and episodes also occurred during sleep. He would be confused for a few minutes after gaining consciousness, complain of headaches, and would sleep at times. He had stopped going to school for 4 years and would refuse to visit his relatives because of fear of a seizure episode. He was treated with sodium valproate up to 800\u2009mg for a year, 2 years back with irregular follow-ups. As a few episodes of seizure occurred in-between, the family opted for treatment from traditional healers instead of medicine, and he had been noncompliant for a year. For the last 4 months, the frequency had increased to 1\u20133 episodes within a day.\n\nA detailed clinical evaluation was done, and he was diagnosed as a case of focal onset generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizure and advised for baseline blood investigations, EEG, and MRI and was restarted on sodium valproate 300\u2009mg BD with the view of using an adequate dose and optimized to 900\u2009mg in a week. The general physical and systemic examination, blood parameters, and MRI brain were normal. EEG showed slow background activity with sharp and spike-wave complexes in both cerebral hemispheres.\n\nAfter optimizing the dose of valproate, he was seizure-free for 6 days. However, he presented to the emergency department with drowsiness, decreased alertness, lethargy, and drooling of saliva with a serum valproate level of 76\u2009mg\/L. In view of the sedating side effect of sodium valproate, the antiepileptic was changed to tablet LEV 500\u2009mg BD. The drowsiness improved after stopping valproate and starting LEV. On the 2nd day, he started saying that he felt like going crazy. On the fourth day, he was restless, agitated, and tried to run away from the ward with delusion of persecution and auditory hallucination, second person voices commenting. The brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS) score was 34, with scores in suspiciousness, hostility, and uncooperativeness.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Evaluating psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nI should list the top five psychiatric diagnoses to consider. The primary one could be Substance\/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder, specifically due to levetiracetam. For secondary options, I might include Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition, like epilepsy, and differentiate from delirium. I need these diagnoses to align with DSM-5-TR and include only the relevant ICD-10 F-codes. Given the patient\u2019s fear of seizures, conditions like agoraphobia or specific phobias may also apply.\n\n**Analyzing fear and symptoms**\n\nThe patient\u2019s fear seems centered on having a seizure rather than the situation itself, which might suggest agoraphobia if he avoids situations due to the potential for a seizure and needing help. He\u2019s stopped attending school and avoided visiting relatives for fear of seizure occurrence, possibly indicating conditions like agoraphobia or a specific phobia. We also need to consider \"Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition\" linked to his epilepsy. Given his sedation issues from valproate, \"Medication-induced delirium\" could be an option, but decreased alertness issues complicate things.\n\n**Clarifying the diagnosis**\n\nThe patient has actual epilepsy, which complicates things. The main psychiatric concern appears to be acute psychosis resulting from levetiracetam, making \"Substance\/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder\" the best fit. I need to find the correct F-code for this diagnosis. According to DSM-5-TR, these codes fall under categories F10-F19 based on the substance. For medication-induced cases, we might use \"F19.9,\" but \"F06.2\" could represent the psychotic disorder due to levetiracetam or epilepsy. There's also \"F19.959\" that might fit, but it's not entirely accurate.\n\n**Determining appropriate codes**\n\nI\u2019m looking at various ways to code the patient\u2019s psychosis related to medications like levodopa or levetiracetam. \"F06.2 Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition\" is a valid option, especially relating to epilepsy or antiepileptic meds. However, for \"Substance\/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder,\" I'd need to peg the right F-code. Using codes like \"F19.951\" may work, but I must remember to keep it strictly within the F-code range. I\u2019ll check established mappings for clarity, especially for conditions like alcohol-induced disorders.\n\n**Identifying potential diagnoses**\n\nFirst, we need to consider the presence of both hallucinations and delusions. DSM-5 specifiers indicate we should note whichever is predominant. For \"Substance\/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder,\" I can specify delusions or hallucinations based on what stands out; in this case, it might be delusions of persecution with auditory hallucinations present. However, since he avoided multiple situations due to fear of seizures, \"Agoraphobia\" may be a secondary diagnosis. \n\nI'll compile the top five diagnoses, which could include:  \n- Substance\/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder (levetiracetam) \u2013 potentially using F19.959 or F06.2.\n- Brief Psychotic Disorder \u2013 coded as F23.\n- Schizophreniform Disorder \u2013 possibly F20.81.\n- Psychotic Disorder due to another medical condition \u2013 using F06.2.\n- Agoraphobia as a secondary condition, given his avoidance of school and relatives due to seizure fear.\n\n**Determining potential diagnoses**\n\nI think one possibility is \"Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition,\" coded as F06.4, which fits since anxiety could be tied to epilepsy. However, it\u2019s hard to confirm whether the anxiety is a direct effect of the condition or a psychological response, so I might list it as a secondary diagnosis.\n\nNext, the timeline is crucial. The patient started experiencing psychosis a few days after beginning levetiracetam, which suggests a medication side effect. This could lead us to \"Substance\/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder,\" likely coded as F19.959, alongside \"Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition,\" coded as F06.2, might go on the list as well. \n\nI\u2019ll craft a differential diagnosis list that might include these options:  \n1. Substance\/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder (levetiracetam) - F19.959  \n2. Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (epilepsy\/postictal psychosis) - F06.2  \n3. Brief Psychotic Disorder - F23  \n4. Schizophreniform Disorder - F20.81  \n5. Agoraphobia as a secondary consideration, given avoidance behavior.\n\n**Evaluating possible diagnoses**\n\nIt seems clear that we\u2019re identifying potential diagnoses related to psychosis possibly stemming from medication or another medical condition. \"Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition\" coded F06.4 is a contender, but we can't confirm if its symptoms are due to the condition itself or a psychological response. \n\nLooking closer at the history, there are strong possibilities like \"Substance\/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder\" (F19.959 due to levetiracetam) and \"Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition\" (F06.2 for epilepsy-related psychosis). Now I\u2019ll list my top five:\n\n1. Substance\/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder (levetiracetam) - F19.959.  \n2. Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (epilepsy) - F06.2.  \n3. Brief Psychotic Disorder - F23.  \n4. Schizophreniform Disorder - F20.81.  \n5. Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (epilepsy) - F06.4.\n\n**Identifying diagnoses for the vignette**\n\nI\u2019m considering significant behaviors that might indicate diagnoses like agoraphobia or specific phobia. Because he avoids situations due to fears of seizures, there's clear anxiety at play. However, for the psychiatric diagnoses, I want to focus on current acute presentations, specifically the psychosis.\n\nIn crafting the top five likely diagnoses, I\u2019m leaning toward:\n\n1. Substance\/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder (likely from levetiracetam) - F19.959.  \n2. Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (epilepsy-related) - F06.2.  \n3. Brief Psychotic Disorder - F23.  \n4. Schizophreniform Disorder - F20.81.  \n5. Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition - F06.4.   \nI\u2019m even contemplating substituting anxiety with agoraphobia due to his avoidance behaviors.\n\n**Finalizing potential diagnoses**\n\nIn reviewing the case, I see we need to focus on significant avoidance behavior and the possible anxiety related to his condition. The avoidance of school and refusal to visit relatives point to some anxiety, but we need to ensure we remain focused on the acute psychosis as well.\n\nFor the top five likely diagnoses, I propose:\n\n1. Substance\/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder (levetiracetam-induced) - F19.959.  \n2. Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (epilepsy-related) - F06.2.  \n3. Brief Psychotic Disorder - F23.  \n4. Schizophreniform Disorder - F20.81.  \n5. Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (epilepsy-related) - F06.4.  \n\nI\u2019m trying to make sure everything aligns smoothly, balancing the acute and persistent features.\n\n**Outlining potential diagnoses**\n\nI need to carefully evaluate the primary and secondary diagnoses while considering the specifics of the case. \n\nThe top five likely diagnoses I\u2019m proposing are:\n\n1. Substance\/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder (due to levetiracetam) - F19.959.  \n2. Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (epilepsy-related) - F06.2.  \n3. Delirium (possibly medication-induced or related to a medical condition) - F05.  \n4. Brief Psychotic Disorder - F23.  \n5. Schizophreniform Disorder - F20.81.  \n\nWhile anxiety is significant, these top five focus on the acute psychosis presented in the vignette.\n\n**Listing psychiatric diagnoses**\n\nThe key task here is to identify the top five likely DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses based on the case vignette. \n\nAfter careful consideration, here\u2019s the list:\n\n1. Substance\/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder (likely levetiracetam-induced) - F19.959.  \n2. Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (epilepsy-related) - F06.2.  \n3. Brief Psychotic Disorder - F23.  \n4. Schizophreniform Disorder - F20.81.  \n5. Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (epilepsy-related) - F06.4.  \n\nThis format aligns with the request to avoid clinical reasoning and focus on the diagnoses with their respective codes.",

They describe their living situation as \"overwhelming\" due to parental boundary issues, though they maintain a supportive romantic relationship since 2019. Their psychiatric history includes diagnoses of MDD and GAD at age 15-16, PTSD in 2016 following emotional abuse by high school friends, and ADHD in 2018 (without neuropsychological evaluation). Current medications include Lisdexamfetamine 50mg (since 2018), various supplements, and a contraceptive injection. They previously tried multiple antidepressants (2011-2015) but discontinued each after approximately two weeks due to suicidal ideation and, in one case, motor disturbances. The patient consumes alcohol socially (3-5 drinks monthly) and has been vaping marijuana 1-3 times weekly for three months primarily to aid sleep and manage anxiety. The patient's primary symptoms onset around age 5 with intrusive visualizations of falling down stairs along with perfectionism through rewriting notes until they felt \"just right\". Currently, they experience significant distress when surroundings are not in the \"right spot\", spending up to 12 hours reorganizing belongings without breaks, which would cause severe distress if interrupted. This \"not just right\" feeling impairs their ability to meet deadlines, complete job applications, and fulfill social obligations. They also engage in checking behaviors when packing (counting socks repeatedly, checking for essential items) and experience distressing sexual intrusive thoughts. Additionally, the patient exhibits skin-picking behaviors, spending over an hour picking at ingrown hairs until bleeding, scratching their neck and jaw during conversations, and tearing at cuticles, with symptoms worsening during periods of anxiety. They've attempted to stop by wearing pants constantly but have been unsuccessful. The patient has a significant history of depression with three past suicide attempts (overdoses in 2014, 2015, and 2017) and self-injury through cutting (stopped in 2017). They currently experience passive suicidal ideation, anhedonia, decreased appetite, sleep difficulties, psychomotor agitation, feelings of worthlessness, and concentration problems, though they report 0% chance of self-harm in the next three months. Social anxiety manifests as persistent fear of judgment and rejection, with distressing rumination about social interactions and excessive reassurance-seeking that has cost them friendships. The patient also reported past sexual abuse by a boyfriend for 4-5 months but denied PTSD symptoms. They disclosed a history of binge eating episodes. During the binge, they ate more rapidly than normal and felt disgusted and embarrassed after. After these eating binges, pt fasted for ~3 days. These eating binges occurred <1 time per week, and the patient has not engaged in these behaviors in the past 2 months.",

The prompt asks for a structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses including F-codes. I can include specifiers, but I want to keep it minimal. For example, urgent clarity with \"Obsessive-compulsive disorder: F42.\" There are subcategories like F42.0 for obsessional thoughts and F42.1 for compulsive acts. F42.2 seems best for mixed symptoms. For Social anxiety disorder, the code is F40.10, and Excoriation disorder is 698.4 in DSM-5.\n\n**Reviewing eating disorder codes**\n\nI\u2019m examining the codes for various eating disorders. For Major depressive disorder recurrent moderate, the code is F33.1. For Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (OSFED), I think it should be F50.8 or possibly F50.89. I want to confirm the differences: F50.89 is for \"Other specified eating disorder,\" while F50.8 covers \"Other eating disorders.\" \n\nI remember codes for anorexia (F50.0), bulimia (F50.2), and binge eating (F50.81). For OSFED, I believe it\u2019s F50.89, and the unspecified feeding disorder is F50.9.\n\n**Clarifying ICD-10 F-codes**\n\nThe prompt specifies \"ICD-10 F-codes,\" which means I might be able to use F50.8 or F50.89. However, since it asks for F-codes and possibly not full ICD-10-CM, I need to be careful. F50.8 covers \"Other eating disorders,\" which includes atypical bulimia, while F50.9 is unspecified. The real catch is that DSM-5-TR uses ICD-10-CM codes, so for OSFED, I believe it's F50.89, alongside others like F33.1 for Major Depressive Disorder and F40.10 for Social Anxiety Disorder.\n\n**Determining diagnostic priorities**\n\nIn ICD-10-CM, F40.10 refers to Social phobia, unspecified, while F40.11 is for Social phobia, generalized. The DSM-5 specifies performance-only, but for now, F40.10 works well. For recurrent moderate Major Depressive Disorder, the code is F33.1. \n\nI should include OCD as a primary condition since it involves significant impairment. My top five likely diagnoses will be: 1) primary OCD, 2) MDD recurrent moderate, 3) Social anxiety disorder, 4) Excoriation disorder, and 5) Other specified feeding or eating disorder, potentially F50.89.

    "vignette":"Felicia Allen was a 32-year-old single woman brought to the emergency room (ER) by police after she apparently tried to steal a city bus in Chicago. Because she appeared to be an \u201cemotionally disturbed person,\u201d a psychiatry consultation was requested.\n\nAccording to the police report, Ms. Allen threatened the driver with a knife, took control of the almost empty city bus, and crashed it. A more complete story was elicited from a friend of Ms. Allen\u2019s who had been on the bus but who had not been arrested. According to her, they had boarded the bus on their way to a nearby shopping mall. Ms. Allen became frustrated when the driver refused her dollar bills, instead demanding exact change. She looked in her purse, but instead of finding exact change, she pulled out a kitchen knife that she carried for protection. The driver fled, so she got into the empty seat and drove the bus across the street into a nearby parked car.\n\nOn examination, Ms. Allen was a handcuffed, heavyset young woman with a bandage on her forehead. She fidgeted and rocked back and forth in her chair. She appeared to be mumbling to herself. When asked what she was saying, the patient made momentary eye contact and just repeated, \u201cSorry, sorry.\u201d She did not respond to other questions.\n\nMore information was elicited from a psychiatrist who had come to the ER soon after the accident. He said that Ms. Allen and her friend were longtime residents at the state psychiatric hospital where he worked. They had just begun to take passes every week as part of an effort toward social remediation; it had been Ms. Allen\u2019s first bus ride without a staff member.\n\nAccording to the psychiatrist, Ms. Allen had received a diagnosis of \u201cchildhood-onset, treatment-resistant paranoid schizophrenia.\u201d She had started hearing voices by age 5 years. Big, strong, intrusive, and psychotic, she had been hospitalized almost constantly since age 11. Her auditory hallucinations generally consisted of a critical voice commenting on her behavior. Her thinking was concrete, but when relaxed she could be self-reflective. She was motivated to please and recurrently said her biggest goal was to \u201chave my own room in my own house with my own friends.\u201d The psychiatrist said that he was not sure what had caused her to pull out the knife. She had not been hallucinating lately and had been feeling less paranoid, but he wondered if she had been more psychotic than she had let on. It was possible that she was just impatient and irritated. The psychiatrist also believed that she had spent almost no period of life developing normally and so had very little experience with the real world.\n\nMs. Allen had been taking clozapine for 1 year, with good resolution of her auditory hallucinations. She had gained 35 pounds on the clozapine, but she had less trouble getting out of bed in the morning and was functioning at a higher level. She was hoping to get a job and live more independently, and the bus trip had been intended as a step in that direction. Because of these improvements and goals, she had insisted on continuing to take the clozapine despite the weight gain.",

It has variations, including potential fourth-digit specifiers like F20.0 for paranoid schizophrenia, although it lacks remission specifiers. I\u2019m considering a vignette involving a person displaying symptoms like mutism, stereotypy, and agitation. There\u2019s a chance it fits catatonia associated with another mental disorder, but it requires at least three symptoms. The details matter, especially regarding her behavior and reactions.\n\n**Considering catatonia diagnosis**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a case where a person repeatedly says \"Sorry,\" which might indicate verbigeration or perseveration linked to catatonia. She seems anxious and is rocking, but I wonder if she\u2019s truly catatonic, especially after a head injury. That could lead to delirium, classified under F05, but there\u2019s confusion due to her bandaged forehead. This complicates the diagnosis \u2013 a traumatic brain injury could be causing her mutism. I\u2019m thinking about how to approach diagnosing catatonia associated with schizophrenia, coded as F06.1.\n\n**Clarifying catatonia coding**\n\nI\u2019m looking into how catatonia is coded in ICD-10-CM and DSM-5. Catatonia associated with another mental disorder should use the underlying disorder's code plus F06.1. It gets a bit confusing since DSM-5 lists three catatonia diagnoses, and F06.1 refers to catatonic disorder due to a medical condition. For catatonic schizophrenia, I see F20.2 is used, but DSM-5 removed this type. It\u2019s tricky, especially with coding and understanding how to properly specify catatonia.\n\n**Reviewing catatonia codes**\n\nI\u2019m trying to clarify the coding for catatonia in DSM-5 and ICD-10-CM. I think catatonia associated with another mental disorder uses the ICD-10-CM code F06.1, which can also refer to medical conditions. It\u2019s a bit confusing since F06.1 is designated for catatonic disorder due to a known physiological condition. Meanwhile, the DSM-5 lists catatonia associated with another mental disorder under code 293.89. With limited features observed, I'm considering the possibility of including \"catatonia associated with schizophrenia\" as well.\n\n**Evaluating potential diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m considering various potential secondary diagnoses for the case at hand. There are possibilities like \"Unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder\" or \"Adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct,\" but I'm not convinced. Other options include \"Other specified disruptive disorder,\" but that doesn't fit either. I contemplate \"Borderline intellectual functioning,\" but there\u2019s no evidence of intellectual disability. I also evaluate catatonia diagnoses and different psychotic disorders. Given the complexity and her history, I think we should focus on established diagnoses like schizophrenia and look closely at her current mental state and possible residual symptoms.\n\n**Assessing diagnoses for clarity**\n\nI\u2019m considering secondary diagnoses, including \"Schizoid personality\" or developmental disorders, but they don't fit well. The bus incident might lead to \"Other specified disruptive disorder,\" yet it lacks sufficient support. I'm looking at \"Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum\" or \"Brief psychotic disorder,\" but given her chronic schizophrenia, those don\u2019t seem right either. It\u2019s crucial to derive a list of top 5 plausible diagnostics while avoiding fabrication. I should highlight her main issues, like catatonia and the exacerbation of schizophrenia, adjusting for any symptoms observed in her behavior.\n\n**Evaluating possible diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m considering various diagnoses for the individual. Starting with primary \"Schizophrenia,\" I think about adding things like an \"Unspecified depressive disorder\" or \"Schizoaffective disorder,\" but those don\u2019t seem to fit well. There\u2019s potential for a \"Catatonia\" diagnosis, given her behavior and the situation, and maybe we can consider \"Intermittent explosive disorder\" for the bus incident. Additionally, I should explore possibilities like \"Unspecified anxiety disorder\" or \"Intellectual disability,\" though these lack solid evidence. It's important to compile top diagnoses that are plausible based on her history and symptoms.\n\n**Determining diagnoses**\n\nI'm exploring various potential diagnoses, starting with \"Schizophrenia\" as the primary. I\u2019m considering conditions like \"Intermittent explosive disorder\" or \"Unspecified disruptive disorder,\" but there's no strong evidence for a pattern of behavior. \"Catatonia\" could be a viable option given her symptoms. However, I need to provide exactly five diagnoses with corresponding codes. I should focus on the most likely conditions: \"Schizophrenia,\" \"Catatonia associated with schizophrenia,\" and perhaps some anxiety or impulse control disorders, but I want to avoid unsupported diagnoses.\n\n**Reviewing potential diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m considering diagnoses focusing on psychiatric F-codes since G-codes are not an option. I'm thinking about conditions like \u201cOther specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder\u201d or \"Adjustment disorder,\" but they might not fit. I need to produce five specific primary and secondary diagnoses, likely including \u201cSchizophrenia\u201d and \u201cCatatonia associated with schizophrenia.\u201d It\u2019s essential to evaluate the aggression and whether it fits impulse-control disorders. I\u2019m noting down codes while ensuring they align with DSM-5-TR guidelines. I want to be thorough and accurate!\n\n**Determining diagnoses for schizophrenia**\n\nI'm focused on establishing the top five psychiatric diagnoses related to schizophrenia, given the onset clues and symptoms. Auditory hallucinations by age five suggest complexities\u2014it could relate to developmental issues. I have some potential secondary diagnoses like \"Catatonia associated with another mental disorder,\" \"Unspecified impulse-control disorder,\" and \"Mild intellectual disability.\" Also, \"Unspecified anxiety disorder\" might be relevant due to her behaviors. Specifying the right conditions meticulously is essential while considering the main diagnosis of schizophrenia!\n\n**Finalizing schizophrenia diagnoses**\n\nI'm working on a structured list of psychiatric diagnoses, focusing on schizophrenia with additional considerations. I can use specifiers like \"Schizophrenia, multiple episodes, currently in partial remission\" alongside \"Catatonia associated with another mental disorder.\" I have four secondary diagnoses like \"Intermittent explosive disorder\" and \"Unspecified anxiety disorder.\" However, I want to make sure these choices are well-supported by evidence, avoiding unnecessary assumptions. Ultimately, my final list aims to align with DSM-5-TR standards while ensuring accuracy.\n\n**Crafting schizophrenia differentials**\n\nI need to provide a list of the top five differential diagnoses in this clinical case. Even though it could include various possibilities like \"Delirium\" or \"Catatonia,\" I must focus on plausible diagnoses. My candidates include \"Schizophrenia,\" given the chronic history, and other conditions like \"Intermittent explosive disorder\" or \"Acute stress reaction.\" I\u2019ll also consider \"Catatonia associated with schizophrenia\" along with \"Delirium due to head injury.\" My goal is to ensure these diagnoses are credible while adhering to the DSM-5-TR standards.\n\n**Listing diagnoses for assessment**\n\nI\u2019m finalizing a list of top differential diagnoses for this case. I\u2019m considering \"Schizophrenia\" as the most likely, followed by \"Catatonia\" and \"Delirium\" due to the head injury. I can include \"Adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct\" as the fourth diagnosis, given her recent stress. Lastly, I might list \"Unspecified dissociative disorder,\" though I ponder if another option would fit better. I\u2019ll ensure that all chosen diagnoses align with F-codes for proper categorization.\n\n**Finalizing differential diagnoses**\n\nI need to outline the top five most likely psychiatric diagnoses. Starting with \"Schizophrenia\" as the primary, I've also considered \"Catatonia,\" especially given her current symptoms like mutism and stereotyped movements. \"Delirium\" could be relevant due to her head injury, followed by \"Unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder\" reflecting her acute response to the crash. Lastly, I'll include \"Other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder\" for her impulsive aggression. Each diagnosis aligns with the necessary F-codes, ensuring clarity and alignment with the assessment criteria.\n\n**Refining possible diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m considering potential psychiatric diagnoses based on the provided details. Starting with \"Schizophrenia\" is a must, given the symptoms. I'm looking at adding \"Catatonia\" and \"Delirium\" based on her behaviors. The additional two could be \"Unspecified psychotic disorder\" and \"Unspecified dissociative disorder,\" but I must ensure these are supported by her symptoms or history. I'm focusing on creating a set of plausible diagnoses that align with the clinical criteria and information provided while refraining from including unrelated disorders.\n\n**Deciding on diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m putting together a list of potential diagnoses that could fit the case. Starting with \"Schizophrenia,\" \"Catatonia associated with schizophrenia,\" and \"Delirium.\" I\u2019m also considering \"Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder\" as possible and \"Unspecified impulse-control disorder.\" However, I have to ensure these align with DSM-5 criteria. Ultimately, I settle on these top five: Schizophrenia, Catatonia, Delirium, Other specified trauma-related disorder, and Other specified disruptive, impulse-control disorder, making sure everything is appropriately supported by the information provided.\n\n**Finalizing diagnosis codes**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on ensuring I have the correct ICD-10 codes for the feasible diagnoses I need to present. First, I\u2019ll stick with \"Schizophrenia - F20.9.\" Next, I'll include \"Catatonia associated with another mental disorder (schizophrenia) - F06.1,\" followed by \"Delirium due to another medical condition - F05.\" I\u2019ll also opt for \"Unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder - F43.9,\" and finally go with \"Unspecified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder - F91.9.\" This gives me a clear list of five relevant diagnoses with their associated codes.\n\n**Clarifying diagnoses**\n\nI'm considering the appropriateness of including \"Unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder\" in my top five diagnoses, but I think \"Adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct - F43.24\" is more fitting. This diagnosis relates to her recent stress from using the bus without staff, which likely triggered her aggressive behavior. However, I must ensure that other adjustments account for her long-standing schizophrenia. \n\nUltimately, my list looks like this:\n\n1. Schizophrenia - F20.9\n2. Catatonia associated with another mental disorder - F06.1\n3. Delirium due to another medical condition - F05\n4. Adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct - F43.24\n5. Other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder - F91.8\n\n**Finalizing diagnostic considerations**\n\nI\u2019m weighing the inclusion of \"Intermittent explosive disorder\" as a potential diagnosis, but I think it's better to go with \"Other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder\" instead. This is because the behavior stems from her history, and I should avoid assuming recurrent episodes. \n\nI\u2019ve decided on my final list of diagnoses:  \n1. Schizophrenia - F20.9  \n2. Catatonia associated with another mental disorder (schizophrenia) - F06.1  \n3. Delirium due to another medical condition - F05  \n4. Adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct - F43.24  \n5. Unspecified dissociative disorder - F44.9\n\n**Finalizing diagnostic considerations**\n\nThe situation with the bus incident raises questions about the possible diagnoses. She showed signs of agitation and possible dissociation, but there are alternatives to consider. \"Unspecified anxiety disorder\" could be plausible given her anxious behavior, but symptoms didn't fully align. Dissociative disorder may fit her mumbling and lack of response better.  \n\nFor the final list, I have:  \n1. Schizophrenia - F20.9  \n2. Catatonia associated with another mental disorder (schizophrenia) - F06.1  \n3. Delirium due to known physiological condition - F05  \n4. Adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct - F43.24  \n5. Unspecified dissociative disorder - F44.9",

Melanie\u2019s mother indicates \u201cMelanie is a unique kid. She doesn\u2019t really make good eye contact with me, her father or her friends, and seems to be overly focused on doing puzzles all day.

    "model_thoughts":"**Evaluating diagnostic codes**\n\nIn ICD-10, hoarding isn't separately coded, so it defaults to F42.3. I should confirm that. To avoid confusion, I want to stick to standard references, but I\u2019m hesitant to link it directly to OCD. Another option could be using F88 for \"Other specified neurodevelopmental disorder,\" but that seems off. I wonder if I should include things like \"Tic disorder, unspecified\" (F95.9) or \"Other specified tic disorder\" (F95.8), but I'm not convinced those fit either. There are more relevant psychiatric diagnoses to consider!\n\n**Identifying plausible comorbidities**\n\nI need to consider plausible comorbidities like Stereotypic Movement Disorder (SMD), anxiety, and OCD. We should list the top five. I could include \"Obsessive-compulsive disorder\" for differential diagnosis and maybe use \"Other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (tic-related)\" or \"Unspecified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder\" (F42.9). Looking at the case, the eye-blinking began around age 8, along with comments about compulsions versus premonitory urges. There\u2019s a pattern with stress-related tics, including self-injurious behaviors and outbursts of screaming.\n\n**Assessing behavioral diagnoses**\n\nIt seems this could be a tic attack rather than OCD. The mother denies any bizarre rituals like excessive handwashing or counting, which emphasizes that they want to highlight the tics instead of OCD. While I could still include OCD as a possibility, it might be less likely. I\u2019m considering other options like \"Unspecified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder\" due to slurs, though those might also be tics. Alternatively, \"Language disorder\" could be relevant because of the noted language delay at 48 months. That seems more supported than OCD since it's a key developmental milestone.\n\n**Examining language and developmental disorders**\n\nEarly delays likely indicate some deficits, but they might have improved with therapy. The history strongly supports Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and language disorder could fit as a specifier within ASD rather than being separate. Still, I consider including \"Language disorder\" as a comorbid condition but wonder if it\u2019s necessary. I ponder including \"Intellectual developmental disorder, unspecified\" due to delays, but labeling it \"Unspecified intellectual disability\" (F79) might not be right either. I think it's better to focus on ASD, Tourette\u2019s disorder, Stereotypic Movement Disorder, Language disorder (F80.2), and Unspecified anxiety disorder.\n\n**Finalizing diagnostic considerations**\n\nI need to ensure we don\u2019t miscode; language disorder corresponds to F80.2. Considering expressive delays and the absence of articulation issues might point towards a language disorder but requires evidence of persistent deficits and functional impairment. I\u2019m contemplating including language disorder as a secondary diagnosis and possibly \"Unspecified communication disorder\" (F80.9) if there\u2019s not enough detail. The symptoms of tics and stereotypies, including self-injury, need careful evaluation alongside her anxiety, and I\u2019ll finalize a list of psychiatric diagnoses referencing DSM-5.\n\n**Determining potential diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m considering signs of ADHD, but it seems more aligned with ASD, given the social deficits. There doesn\u2019t appear to be enough evidence to support ADHD or other neurodevelopmental disorders. While there are indicators of a possible language disorder due to early speech delay, I want to include compelling evidence for my final list of diagnoses. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll continue with my diagnoses for now, listing Autism Spectrum Disorder and Tourette's disorder confidently, along with others: \n\n1. Autism spectrum disorder - F84.0  \n2. Tourette's disorder - F95.2  \n3. Stereotypic movement disorder, with self-injury - F98.4  \n4. Unspecified anxiety disorder - F41.9  \n5. Language disorder - F80.2.  \n\nI\u2019m pondering if I should list other potential conditions that could capture her behaviors more accurately.\n\n**Finalizing diagnoses list**\n\nI'm evaluating the recurrent aggressive outbursts and finding they don't neatly fit into another mental disorder's criteria while weighing the possibility of impulse-control issues or obsessive-compulsive related disorders. But ultimately, I\u2019m preparing my final diagnoses based on the criteria and past developmental notes. \n\nHere's the structured list I\u2019ve settled on:  \n\n1. Autism spectrum disorder - F84.0  \n2. Tourette's disorder - F95.2  \n3. Stereotypic movement disorder, with self-injury - F98.4  \n4. Language disorder - F80.2  \n5. Unspecified anxiety disorder - F41.9  \n\nI will focus on this list for clarity and accuracy!\n\n**Finalizing diagnosis codes**\n\nI\u2019m double-checking the terms and codes I need to ensure everything aligns with DSM-5-TR standards. I want to make sure I capitalize \"Tourette's Disorder\" properly, and I've confirmed that the code F80.2 is accurate for the DSM-5 Language Disorder, which is great. \n\nNow that I've reviewed everything, I'm ready to finalize the list. It's all coming together nicely!",

    "model_thoughts":"**Determining diagnoses**\n\nI need to create a structured list of psychiatric diagnoses using ICD-10 F-codes based on the information provided, ensuring no fabrication. There\u2019s a vignette about a 31-year-old single man with self-confidence issues and a series of unsatisfying relationships. I'll focus on the top five most likely DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses: one primary diagnosis and four secondary ones. It\u2019s important to parse the vignette carefully to capture the nuances of his situation correctly.\n\n**Identifying potential disorders**\n\nHe feels desperate about being single, but that desperation complicates his chances of finding a girlfriend, creating a negative spiral. Since his latest breakup, he's been sad with frequent crying spells, prompting him to seek treatment. Interestingly, he denies classic depression symptoms like sleep or appetite changes. However, he was prescribed alprazolam for anxiety, which he\u2019s been escalating and getting from multiple doctors, indicating potential benzodiazepine dependence. The psychiatrist considers diagnosing him with a benzodiazepine use disorder alongside a personality disorder and notes an adjustment disorder with depressed mood.\n\n**Determining primary diagnoses**\n\nI need to identify the most likely diagnoses based on clinical data, not just coding. Benzodiazepine use disorder could potentially be the primary diagnosis, but I should also consider personality disorders. Dependent personality disorder stands out due to her reliance on others for decision-making and her fear of being alone. This connects to her self-esteem issues and assertiveness struggles. It\u2019s challenging to determine what should be primary, especially since alprazolam misuse poses significant risks. I'll need to decide on the top five diagnoses for clarity.\n\n**Choosing primary diagnosis**\n\nI need to determine the primary diagnosis and consider listing Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder, Severe (benzodiazepine) as prime due to the daily alprazolam use from multiple prescribers. There are also long-term dependent personality traits to account for. While I need to follow the rubric for Level 5 reasoning, the focus is on listing five key diagnoses. For the first, I\u2019ll confirm it's F13.20 for uncomplicated dependence. Noting the withdrawal symptoms when reducing dosage, F13.23 (with withdrawal) could also be relevant.\n\n**Finalizing diagnoses**\n\nI must clarify the primary diagnosis. The severe Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder is likely the primary due to the daily alprazolam usage and noted withdrawal symptoms. However, the presence of dependent personality traits is significant too. The top five diagnoses I'll list are: \n\n1. Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder, Severe - F13.20\n2. Dependent Personality Disorder - F60.7\n3. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood - F43.21\n4. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder - F41.9\n5. Other Specified Depressive Disorder - F32.A \n\nThis set feels right based on the provided information.\n\n**Clarifying diagnosis codes**\n\nI'm sorting out the diagnosis codes for this case, particularly F32.A, which is something I'd consider using, but it might not be widely recognized. F13.20 is solid for sedative use disorder as primary, particularly with the severe usage. Dependent Personality Disorder (F60.7) and Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood (F43.21) follow. For a potential fourth diagnosis, Sedative Withdrawal is suggested, code F13.239 likely fits. I think it\u2019s all about weighing the evidence and ensuring we\u2019re specifying accurately for the best support.\n\n**Deciding on diagnosis codes**\n\nI'm contemplating whether to use F13.23 as the primary code, since the patient experiences withdrawal symptoms when cutting back. However, he's not currently in withdrawal, which complicates things. F13.20 is safe for uncomplicated dependence. I'm also weighing including withdrawal as a primary diagnosis. For the final five, I'm considering F13.20 for sedative use disorder, F60.7 for dependent personality disorder, F43.21 for adjustment disorder, F41.9 for unspecified anxiety, and F32.A for unspecified depressive disorder. These seem like plausible choices based on the situation.\n\n**Evaluating diagnosis codes**\n\nI'm considering whether F13.20 is the best code since it reflects current use but not necessarily withdrawal. F13.23 could connect dependence with withdrawal, which he likely experienced when reducing intake. It's a tricky situation; he may have a history of withdrawal symptoms but isn't currently in that state. My top five likely diagnoses might include \"Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder,\" \"Dependent personality disorder,\" \"Adjustment disorder with depressed mood,\" \"Unspecified anxiety disorder,\" and possibly \"Other specified depressive disorder\" based on his symptoms.\n\n**Finalizing diagnosis codes**\n\nI'm looking to finalize five key diagnoses. Firstly, I think \"Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, severe\" (F13.20) makes sense as the primary diagnosis. Then I can include \"Dependent personality disorder\" (F60.7), \"Adjustment disorder with depressed mood\" (F43.21), \"Unspecified anxiety disorder\" (F41.9), and \"Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal\" (F13.239). Although there\u2019s a risk of redundancy with withdrawal, it reflects his past symptoms. This combination feels well-supported and plausible based on his reported experiences!\n\n**Determining top diagnoses**\n\nI'm debating the best five diagnoses to list. \u201cSedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, severe\u201d (F13.20) seems like a strong primary diagnosis, along with \u201cDependent Personality Disorder\u201d (F60.7) and \u201cAdjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood\u201d (F43.21). Including \u201cSedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal\u201d (F13.239) is also likely, as he has experienced withdrawal. For the fifth, I\u2019m considering \u201cUnspecified Anxiety Disorder\u201d (F41.9) due to his anxiety when cutting back, but there\u2019s some uncertainty there! I think that captures his situation well.\n\n**Deciding on diagnoses**\n\nI'm determining the top five likely diagnoses based on the situation. I think it's reasonable to list \u201cAdjustment disorder with depressed mood\u201d and \u201cUnspecified depressive disorder\u201d as separate options, and the primary two should be \u201cSedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder\u201d (F13.20) and \u201cDependent Personality Disorder\u201d (F60.7). Then I could add \u201cSedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Withdrawal\u201d (F13.239) as the fourth and maybe finish with \u201cUnspecified Anxiety Disorder\u201d (F41.9) to cover all bases.\n\n**Confirming diagnoses and codes**\n\nI need to finalize the top five diagnoses for this case. I'll include:\n\n1. Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder (alprazolam) - F13.20\n2. Dependent Personality Disorder - F60.7\n3. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood - F43.21\n4. Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Withdrawal - F13.239\n5. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder - F41.9\n\nI've confirmed these codes are correct, and I should specify that Sedative Withdrawal is accurately coded as F13.239. I'll ensure everything matches up without extra disclaimers.",

On limited assessment, pt denied thinking the devil was after him and did not make any grandiose statements about him being God. He did not appear internally preoccupied but was very sleepy. He was later assessed in the afternoon after he was repotedly asking to leave. He denied suicidal ideations, homicidal ideations, or auditory\/visual hallucinations. While he was still irritable, he was more cooperative and states he does not recall being at a gas station. He does endorse to using marijuana, methamphetamine, and PCP \u201cfor 2 days straight\u201d. He is currently homeless and wants to go to the shelter.

    "model_thoughts":"**Reviewing ICD-10 codes**\n\nI'm checking some ICD-10 codes related to cannabis use. For cannabis dependence, the code is F12.20, while F12.10 is for cannabis abuse. When considering DSM-5-TR classifications, it seems like we might want to choose F12.10 since we don't know the user's severity level. However, it might be best to lean towards using F12.20, especially since there's a history of substance use disorder. So, F12.20 seems widely accepted for severe cases.\n\n**Considering diagnosis codes**\n\nThe instructions are clear: I should base my answer strictly on the provided info and my clinical expertise without fabricating details. Selecting F12.20 could imply a severe dependence, but maybe we should consider using \"Cannabis use disorder, unspecified severity.\" However, that doesn't exist. Another option could be F12.929 for unspecified intoxication. Since there's evidence of intoxication, using intoxication codes might be more straightforward. I might still want to include the history of substance use disorder in my considerations.\n\n**Identifying diagnosis codes**\n\nFrom the vignette, I can state that we have a few key diagnoses: Substance\/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder related to methamphetamine, PCP, or cannabis, along with stimulant and cannabis intoxication. I need to summarize the top three intoxications plus the psychotic disorder.\n\nI see that for cannabis intoxication, F12.929 is \"Cannabis use, unspecified with intoxication, unspecified.\" The general pattern for intoxication codes follows a similar structure, and I want to make sure I get it all right!\n\n**Clarifying alcohol intoxication codes**\n\nI'm diving into the coding for alcohol intoxication in the DSM-5. I think F10.129 is the code for \"Alcohol intoxication, uncomplicated,\" but it also sounds like it might include alcohol abuse. There's also 303.00 linked to intoxication with a disorder. I'm a little unsure since F10.129 describes it as \"Alcohol abuse with intoxication, unspecified,\" which seems off. Additionally, F10.929 is for \"Alcohol use, unspecified with intoxication, unspecified.\" It's tricky to keep track of these distinctions!\n\n**Mapping DSM-5 codes**\n\nI\u2019m working with the diagnosis codes based on the user's instructions. For \"Substance\/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder,\" I suspect F19.959 is the right fit, especially with unspecified psychotic disorder. However, since there are symptoms of delusions, F19.951 might be better. For alcohol-induced psychotic disorders, there are various codes to consider, like F10.151 and F10.159. \n\nAlso, for stimulant use disorder, F15.20 might reflect moderate\/severe dependence, but it\u2019s tricky since we don't know the full severity. Given past history, I think F15.20 could be my best option.\n\n**Confirming diagnoses and codes**\n\nI\u2019m contemplating coding options for stimulant use disorder. F15.90 refers to \"Other stimulant use, unspecified,\" which isn\u2019t accurate for a use disorder. Instead, I could list stimulant intoxication with code F15.929, as the user had recent meth use. Given his history of substance use and the evidence of intoxication, I want to cross-reference potential diagnoses, prioritizing the substance-induced psychotic disorder. \n\nThe top five diagnoses I\u2019m considering are:  \n1. Substance-induced psychotic disorder  \n2. Methamphetamine use disorder  \n3. Cannabis use disorder  \n4. Phencyclidine use disorder  \n5. Schizophrenia  \n\nNext, I\u2019ll ensure the corresponding ICD-10 codes accurately reflect the DSM-5-TR diagnoses. For the primary diagnosis, I might go with F19.959 for \"Other psychoactive substance-induced psychotic disorder.\"\n\n**Reviewing ICD-10-CM codes**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about the proper ICD-10-CM codes and whether to include decimals. The user mentioned F19.5, but since that\u2019s not ICD-10-CM, it might be seen as incomplete. Given that they specified DSM-5-TR and F-codes, I realize DSM-5-TR uses ICD-10-CM in the U.S., which typically has more digits. For accuracy, I\u2019ll provide complete ICD-10-CM codes where possible and confirm that the needed codes, like F19.959 for substance-related psychotic disorder, exist.\n\n**Exploring ICD-10-CM codes**\n\nI\u2019m considering using code F19.959 for \"Other psychoactive substance use, unspecified with psychotic disorder,\" even if the delusions specification isn't confirmed. It might still be acceptable because we know delusions are present. I think the last digit in the code indicates complications like hallucinations or delusions. For example, I recall that for alcohol use, it\u2019s F10. I\u2019ll need to clarify these codes carefully to ensure everything is accurate.\n\n**Evaluating diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m considering if we should choose multiple diagnosis options. The code for PCP-induced psychotic disorder feels more precise, but I don\u2019t want to fabricate details. It\u2019s important to attribute it to PCP as at least one cause. However, since multiple substances were used, it complicates things. Maybe a better diagnosis could be \"Substance-induced psychotic disorder\" without specifying the substance, but the DSM often requires identification if it\u2019s known.\n\n**Organizing diagnostic codes**\n\nI want to make sure I'm labeling the disorders correctly and matching codes accurately. For \"Stimulant use disorder,\" I'm considering labeling it as \"Other stimulant use disorder\" with code F15.20, since F15.90 might not align properly. Also, I can use F12.20 for \"Cannabis use disorder\" and F16.20 for hallucinogens like PCP. I\u2019ll ensure the format is strict: just the diagnosis with the ICD-10 F-code in a clear list, without any extra explanations.\n\n**Deciding on diagnosis codes**\n\nI'm considering how to classify the unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders with code F29. I want to confirm that F16.20 relates to hallucinogen dependence, which seems right. However, I'm also thinking about whether to list \"Schizophrenia\" instead. The patient has psychosis history and has taken antipsychotics, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's schizophrenia. It might be safer to stick with F29. The unspecified schizophrenia spectrum seems to fit better given the uncertainty.",

    "vignette":"A 39-year-old Caucasian male presented to inpatient psychiatry after initially presenting to the emergency department with psychosis. He had been found crawling in a parking lot with several feet of intestines dragging on the ground. The patient was only responding internally during the examination, and a urine drug screen was positive only for cannabis. He received an emergent exploratory laparotomy with a partial colectomy. He stabilized medically but became briefly catatonic on day six of hospitalization, which was resolved with intravenous diazepam. On day seven, he was transferred to the inpatient psychiatry unit on a voluntary basis.\n\nOn admission to inpatient psychiatry, the patient was fully oriented and able to recall stabbing himself in the abdomen because characters in his mind told him to, having an out-of-body experience as he watched himself pull out several feet of intestines. He felt compelled to follow the voices' commands because he had guilt about his history of sexual abuse towards women. He then recalls running out of his apartment and waking up in the hospital. He endorsed paranoia and auditory hallucinations for the last 10 years but never sought treatment. He felt hopeless, yet believed his potential was infinite. He had no suicidal ideation and expressed a fear of hurting himself upon returning home if the voices persisted.\n\nHe had never been diagnosed with a psychiatric illness or received treatment, but he did see a psychiatrist at age 17 after he was charged with indecent exposure. He recalled periods in his life when he had little need for sleep, had racing thoughts, and felt that signs and advertisements were speaking directly to him. His social history was notable for heavy cannabis use beginning at age 18. He was a daily user for 5-6 years and began experiencing paranoia and auditory hallucinations. Despite quitting for two years, the psychotic symptoms persisted, and he reported currently using cannabis 3-4 days per week. He also had a history of trauma and was emotionally and physically abused by his father who had alcohol use disorder.\n\nOn a physical exam, the patient had normal speech and appearance, an expansive affect, and poor insight.

    "model_thoughts":"**Structuring diagnoses list**\n\nI need to follow the instructions closely while reading the clinical case and building a differential diagnosis. They want me to provide a structured list of DSM-5-TR diagnoses, starting with the top five likely ones along with ICD-10 F-codes. \n\nI could list schizophrenia as primary and include schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, bipolar I with psychotic features, cannabis-induced psychotic disorder, and cannabis use disorder. Although cannabis use isn't an alternative diagnosis\u2014it's more of a comorbidity\u2014I think it\u2019s important to include since the patient uses cannabis regularly. Maybe I should reconsider adding catatonia instead?\n\n**Finalizing differential diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m considering the acute nature of catatonia as a specifier. Should I include \"Other specified dissociative disorder\" due to the out-of-body experience the patient described? He mentioned watching himself, which could indicate dissociation, but that experience occurred during self-injury. Given the context of psychosis and trauma, it\u2019s tricky. He feels guilt about sexual abuse, which could hint at OCD, but he hasn't had treatment. \n\nI'm thinking of listing:  \n1. Schizophrenia - F20.9  \n2. Cannabis use disorder, moderate\/severe - F12.20  \n3. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type - F25.0  \n4. Bipolar I disorder, most recent episode manic, with psychotic features - F31.2  \n5. Catatonia associated with another mental disorder - F06.1  \n\nBut should catatonia rank above bipolar? Perhaps I should lower it in the list, and I might need to consider \"Posttraumatic stress disorder,\" although there's insufficient evidence.\n\n**Evaluating diagnostic options**\n\nI'm considering whether to include \"Other specified personality disorder (antisocial traits).\" We need to assess risk factors like heavy cannabis use, trauma, early sexual misconduct, and a possible personality disorder, but I can\u2019t make a definitive diagnosis. \n\nSo, for the top five diagnoses, I\u2019m thinking: a primary psychotic disorder, comorbid cannabis use disorder, a mood disorder, catatonia, and substance-induced psychosis. Regarding cannabis-induced psychotic disorder, it usually resolves quickly, suggesting the persistence might indicate a primary issue. \n\nCatatonia is present and possibly more relevant than cannabis-induced psychosis, but it may relate to a medical condition. I'm contemplating PTSD as a significant factor in paranoia or hallucinations due to trauma, but there aren\u2019t any intrusive symptoms. \n\nMaybe I should explore \"Unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder,\" but including \"Other specified paraphilic disorder\" or \"Exhibitionistic disorder\" feels uncertain as well. Including \"Unspecified personality disorder\" seems unnecessary too.\n\n**Confirming ICD-10 codes**\n\nI\u2019ll keep catatonia and mood in my differential list. The output will just be the list, so I need to confirm the ICD-10 codes, ensuring they\u2019re accurate.\n\n1. F20.9: Schizophrenia, unspecified.  \n2. F12.20: Cannabis dependence, uncomplicated, which aligns with the DSM's cannabis use disorder. There\u2019s also F12.10 for cannabis abuse, but DSM-5 removed those terms. I think F12.20 fits better given the heavy, continued use, suggesting moderate\/severe.  \n3. F25.0: Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type.  \n4. F31.2: Bipolar disorder, current episode manic with psychotic symptoms (or Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features).  \n5. F06.1: Catatonia associated with another mental disorder (specifier).\n\n**Finalizing diagnostic list**\n\nI\u2019m clarifying that \"Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features\" corresponds to F31.2. We should be careful to exclude non-psychiatric diagnoses that don\u2019t use F-codes, like \"exploratory laparotomy.\" \n\nNow, let\u2019s go with the final output and format it correctly, avoiding any extra spaces or bullet points. Here\u2019s the structured list:\n\n1. Schizophrenia - F20.9  \n2. Cannabis use disorder - F12.20  \n3. Catatonia associated with another mental disorder - F06.1  \n4. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type - F25.0  \n5. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, with psychotic features - F31.2  \n\nDouble-checking: F12.20 is indeed fine for cannabis dependence. Let\u2019s respond!",

    "model_thoughts":"**Listing diagnostic codes**\n\nI'm thinking about specifying \"Oppositional Defiant Disorder\" along with its severe form. I need to verify codes for various disorders without going into reasoning. The codes I\u2019m considering are: F91.3 for Oppositional Defiant Disorder, F91.9 for Conduct Disorder (unspecified onset), F90.9 for Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (unspecified), F34.81 for Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, and F43.24 for Adjustment Disorder with Disturbance of Conduct. I should ensure that everything aligns with DSM-5-TR.\n\n**Evaluating disorder codes**\n\nI'm assessing whether to include \"Disruptive Behavior Disorder, Unspecified\" or \"Intermittent Explosive Disorder\" (F63.81) in this context. The situation involves behaviors like kicking a desk, but it doesn't show clear physical aggression, which IED requires. I see some stress mentioned related to a parent, but I'm leaning away from adjustment disorder since parent-child conflict is more relevant, even if Z-codes are excluded. I\u2019m thinking it could be better to include \"Unspecified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder\" instead of adjustment disorder, but we already have Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) coded.\n\n**Clarifying disorder criteria**\n\nI need to determine five diagnostic options, so I'm considering including \"Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder\" (F91.8) to address partial ODD criteria. I could also think about adding \"ADHD\" and \"Specific Learning Disorder\" with code F81.9. However, the evidence is lacking for that. I wonder if \"Adjustment Disorder with Disturbance of Conduct\" might be better since there could be stress from a conflict with a parent. But I\u2019m not completely sure if that fits. It's tricky!\n\n**Evaluating potential diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to include \"Unspecified Depressive Disorder\" (F32.A) or \"Other Specified Anxiety Disorder\" (F41.8), but those don\u2019t seem fitting since the user denies any issues. The most likely diagnosis looks like Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), and it makes sense to have a plausible secondary disorder, but I want to avoid feeling too high about \"Conduct Disorder.\" I need to interpret behaviors like arguing and deliberately annoying others to see if they match ODD criteria, which involve patterns of anger and defiance lasting at least six months.\n\n**Assessing possible diagnoses**\n\nI'm analyzing behaviors like arguing with authority and making messes to determine if they match ODD. He mentions stress from his mom, which could contribute but doesn't directly indicate blame. There's a chance of \"Conduct Disorder,\" given some disrespectful behaviors, but he doesn't meet enough criteria to support it. Overall, ODD seems to fit best, and I need secondary diagnoses. Possible options include ADHD, Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, Adjustment Disorder, and Intermittent Explosive Disorder. It\u2019s tricky to find the right balance and ensure I\u2019m not repeating codes while staying within the top five.\n\n**Determining diagnoses**\n\nI see the question is about a child with defiant and argumentative behavior, which seems to point to Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD). The task is to provide the top five diagnoses, including differentials like Conduct Disorder, ADHD, DMDD, and Adjustment Disorder. I\u2019m leaning toward ODD as the primary, with Conduct Disorder included as a secondary, even if the criteria aren't fully met. It\u2019s challenging, given the behaviors described, but I need to choose plausible diagnoses. Let's consider the data more carefully and finalize the top five!\n\n**Finalizing F-codes**\n\nI'm ensuring to provide only F-codes for the diagnoses. I\u2019ve reviewed: F91.3 for Oppositional Defiant Disorder, F90.9 for Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder, F91.9 for Conduct Disorder, F34.81 for Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, and F43.24 for Adjustment Disorder. \n\nI'm contemplating including \"Intermittent Explosive Disorder\" or possibly \"Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder\" but focusing on what's most plausible. After careful consideration, I\u2019m finalizing the top five diagnoses based on the clinical vignette I analyzed.\n\n**Finalizing Diagnoses and F-codes**\n\nI\u2019m evaluating conduct disorder as part of the differential. Looking at the criteria, there are none that fit from the available data. Therefore, it's less likely to be a primary issue. As for Intermittent Explosive Disorder, while there are some signs, its presence is weak. \n\nFor the structured list, I will summarize the top five diagnoses without extra punctuation or unnecessary text: \n\n1. Oppositional Defiant Disorder - F91.3  \n2. Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder, Unspecified Type - F90.9  \n3. Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder - F34.81  \n4.

    "model_thoughts":"**Analyzing diagnosis hierarchy**\n\nI'm thinking about hierarchical diagnoses related to DMDD and ODD. If DMDD is diagnosed, ODD shouldn't be included. The question asks for the top five likely diagnoses, which makes me consider ODD as a differential. However, they want a structured DSM-5-TR list, implying actual diagnoses. Since DMDD is primary, I might list Conduct Disorder or ODD as secondary. The phrasing suggests I should focus on rankings rather than comorbidity, possibly allowing for alternative diagnoses.\n\n**Considering differential diagnoses**\n\nThe question about the \"top 5 most likely diagnoses\" feels more like a differential list. I think we can include Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) and Conduct Disorder, even if DMDD might negate ODD. However, I want to base everything on the provided information; I can't assume DMDD fully meets criteria.\n\nPossible diagnoses could include Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, ODD, and Conduct Disorder. I\u2019m considering the specifics for ADHD and Specific Learning Disorder, but I'm not sure if ADHD fits since there aren't symptoms present.\n\n**Evaluating potential diagnoses**\n\nI'm considering how repeated academic struggles might indicate neurodevelopmental issues rather than strictly psychiatric ones. Potential diagnoses include Social Anxiety Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder due to signs of social isolation and irritability. I also thought about Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder, which does have an ICD-10 code.\n\nThen there's Autism Spectrum Disorder; given the social issues and irritability, it could fit, although there's no evidence of restricted interests. Other options include Intermittent Explosive Disorder and Adjustment Disorder, but the longstanding nature of issues makes those less likely.\n\n**Identifying differential diagnoses**\n\nI think it's better to select four secondary diagnoses that represent differentials. The user noted significant social isolation, which might stem from social skill deficits, low self-esteem, mood issues, or bullying experiences. However, he also tries to engage socially, like wanting to join a basketball team, which indicates interest in social contexts but struggles with interpersonal conflicts.\n\nConsidering irritability and aggressive incidents, DMDD, ODD, ADHD, and possibly depression or ASD come to mind. Given his hospitalization and signs of severe aggression, Conduct Disorder could fit, though his apparent perception of unfairness complicates things since it doesn't necessarily indicate remorse.\n\n**Determining top diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m noting that the user is the primary caretaker of pets, suggesting kindness, which is a good sign against cruelty. Given his recurrent fights, Intermittent Explosive Disorder comes to mind, but DMDD aligns better since it involves chronic irritability. I\u2019m considering my top five diagnoses:\n\n1. Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder - F34.81\n2. Oppositional Defiant Disorder - F91.3\n3. Conduct Disorder, adolescent-onset type - F91.2\n4. Specific Learning Disorder - F81.9\n5. Autism Spectrum Disorder - F84.0 or possibly Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder - F90.9. \n\nBoth ASD and ADHD could reflect social struggles, but we'll need to focus on the strongest support for each diagnosis based on his behaviors.\n\n**Finalizing diagnoses list**\n\nI could consider replacing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) with Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Many teens with chronic irritability and conflicts often have ADHD. Given his social isolation, lack of friends, and academic difficulties, these could indicate ADHD. However, his irritability leans more toward a defiant or aggressive behavior pattern from his being kicked off the basketball team. \n\nSo, the final top diagnoses would likely be:\n\n1. Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (F34.81)\n2. Oppositional Defiant Disorder (F91.3)\n3. Conduct Disorder, unspecified onset (F91.9)\n4. Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder, unspecified presentation (F90.9)\n5. Specific Learning Disorder (F81.9)\n\nThis list balances the evidence while ensuring I use the correct codes!\n\n1. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder - F34.81  \n2. Oppositional defiant disorder - F91.3  \n3. Conduct disorder, unspecified onset - F91.9  \n4.

While Mr. Young sat quietly beside her, she reported that a change had come over him during the last 6 months. He was either quiet and withdrawn or uncharacteristically irritable. He had begun to drink alcohol to excess in social situations, sometimes embarrassing her. He often came home late, or not at all, claiming to have been at the office. When away from home, he rarely answered phone calls and text messages. She wondered if he was having an affair. Mr. Young denied seeing anyone else and indicated he had just been having a hard time.\n\nAfter his wife left the psychiatrist\u2019s office, Mr. Young reported a great deal of stress at work over the last year as he tried to deal with industry-wide setbacks and personal financial losses. He said he felt down and depressed most of the time. He reported difficulty sleeping most nights, loss of interest in his wife and children, low energy, and feelings of failure and self-criticism. He had frequent thoughts of wanting to be dead and of suicide, but he denied any suicidal intent or plans.\n\nWhen asked about the alcohol, he acknowledged that he had been drinking heavily for at least 6 months. When asked about other substances, he asked about therapeutic confidentiality and then acknowledged that he had been using cocaine several times per week for about 9 months. He kept his cocaine use from his wife because he knew she would be judgmental. In the beginning, cocaine put him in a reliably positive, optimistic mood, and he found that he could more successfully churn through large volumes of otherwise tedious and discouraging work. Although his work required some socializing in the evening, he also began to regularly go to bars in the evening just so that he would have a place to comfortably combine cocaine with alcohol. He craved the high from cocaine, went out of his way to obtain it, and spent a lot of time getting high that he would previously have been spending with his family.\n\nWhen asked to clarify the sequence of work stress, cocaine use, and depression symptoms, he reported that he had felt worried and discouraged about work for a year, but the feelings of depression, loss of interest, irritability, insomnia, and low self-esteem had not begun until about 6 months earlier, 3 months after he had begun to use cocaine regularly. He experienced those depressive symptoms most of the day every day, whether or not he had taken cocaine within the last several days.\n\nMr. Young denied any previous episodes of depression, other mood or anxiety disorders, or suicide attempts. He drank socially. He had experimented with cannabis and cocaine as a teenager but had never developed a pattern of regular use or impairment until the past year.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Clarifying DSM diagnoses and ICD codes**\n\nI\u2019m checking ICD-10-CM codes related to cocaine dependence, like F14.24 for cocaine dependence with mood disorder and F14.20 for uncomplicated dependence. I\u2019m thinking about using \"Cocaine-induced depressive disorder\" which might map to F14.24, but it includes unspecified mood disorder. There\u2019s also F14.94 to consider. However, the vignette seems to suggest cocaine use disorder alongside major depressive disorder. I need to be cautious; they can't both be assigned simultaneously, but maybe as comorbid possibilities?\n\n**Identifying diagnoses for the case**\n\nI\u2019m outlining the top 5 diagnoses, considering both primary and secondary ones, including comorbid conditions. MDD and Cocaine Use Disorder seem likely, along with Alcohol Use Disorder, and possibly Generalized Anxiety Disorder, though his anxiety symptoms aren\u2019t strong enough for that. I\u2019m hesitant about including \"Adjustment disorder with depressed mood,\" but maybe as a differential. I should also consider \"Substance\/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder.\" Overall, maybe Primary could be Major Depressive Disorder with moderate features or suicidal ideation?\n\n**Determining primary diagnosis**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about which diagnosis should be primary. Major Depressive Disorder seems likely since the main complaint involves depressive symptoms alongside substance use. However, I need to consider both conditions. Based on the details, the individual appears to have binge drinking in social situations, which could meet the criteria for Alcohol Use Disorder. Although I want to avoid fabricating, I feel it might be reasonable to infer moderate severity based on heavy use and social impairment, but I need to ensure there\u2019s enough information to support the diagnosis.\n\n**Assessing alcohol use disorder criteria**\n\nI'm evaluating the criteria for Alcohol Use Disorder. It seems there's recurrent alcohol use, but it\u2019s not making clear role obligations difficult. While his drinking embarrasses his wife, it doesn't clearly lead to significant social issues. The criteria for physically hazardous situations, tolerance, withdrawal, and craving aren't met. However, if his drinking is mainly to combine with cocaine, I think it could qualify as \"Alcohol Use Disorder, mild\" with at least two criteria being satisfied, such as using more than intended and experiencing social problems.\n\n**Formulating diagnoses for the vignette**\n\nI'm carefully evaluating the criteria for various diagnoses, especially focusing on Major Depressive Disorder since that's a likely primary concern due to the depressive symptoms noted. Cocaine Use Disorder provides strong evidence for a second diagnosis, while Alcohol Use Disorder is also plausible. I need to decide on the severity of MDD, possibly leaning towards moderate based on the symptoms. There\u2019s also the option of Stimulant-Induced Depressive Disorder or Adjustment Disorder as differentials. The prompt asks for a structured list of the top five diagnoses, which may include differentials rather than strictly comorbid conditions. So I'll consider including both diagnoses that fit as possibilities based on the details provided in the vignette.\n\n**Listing primary and secondary diagnoses**\n\nI need to specify a primary diagnosis and four secondary diagnoses as requested. For the primary, I'll go with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) since it aligns well with the symptoms observed. The secondary diagnoses can include Cocaine Use Disorder, Alcohol Use Disorder, Substance\/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder, and possibly Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood. \n\nThe corresponding ICD-10 codes would be:  \n1. Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, moderate: F32.1  \n2. Cocaine Use Disorder: F14.20  \n3. Alcohol Use Disorder, mild: F10.10  \n4. Substance\/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (cocaine-induced): F14.24  \n5. Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood: F43.21\n\n**Identifying and coding diagnoses**\n\nI'm examining the criteria for diagnosing alcohol use disorder based on the user's drinking habits. While there's ambiguity in some criteria, it appears that criterion (f) of social or interpersonal problems is satisfied. We might consider \"Alcohol use disorder\" given the evidence of excessive drinking. For the formal diagnosis, I\u2019ll list the top five diagnoses with their respective codes: \n\n1. Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, moderate - F32.1  \n2. Cocaine Use Disorder - F14.20  \n3. Alcohol Use Disorder, mild - F10.10  \n4. Substance\/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (cocaine-induced) - F14.24  \n5. Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood - F43.21\n\n**Finalizing the diagnoses list**\n\nI\u2019m refining the list of diagnoses for this case. The challenge is ensuring I stick to distinct diagnoses without redundancy. It seems I can include Major Depressive Disorder (F32.1), Cocaine Use Disorder (F14.20), Alcohol Use Disorder (F10.10), and Substance\/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (cocaine-induced, F14.24). Lastly, I\u2019ll add Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood (F43.21) to round out the five, even though some may overlap. Here\u2019s the structured list I\u2019ll present:\n\n1. Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, moderate - F32.1  \n2. Cocaine Use Disorder, moderate - F14.20  \n3. Alcohol Use Disorder, mild - F10.10  \n4. Substance\/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (cocaine-induced) - F14.24  \n5. Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood - F43.21\n\n**Clarifying primary and secondary diagnoses**\n\nI\u2019m looking at whether to prioritize Major Depressive Disorder or Cocaine Use Disorder as the primary diagnosis. Given the significant depressive symptoms, especially with suicidal thoughts, I think Major Depressive Disorder (F32.1) should be the primary. However, I also need to include Cocaine Use Disorder (F14.20) and Alcohol Use Disorder (F10.10). \n\nThe fourth diagnosis could be Substance\/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (F14.24) due to cocaine use, and lastly, Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood (F43.21). Here\u2019s the final structured list:\n\n1. Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, moderate - F32.1  \n2. Cocaine Use Disorder, moderate - F14.20  \n3. Alcohol Use Disorder, mild - F10.10  \n4. Substance\/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (cocaine-induced) - F14.24  \n5. Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood - F43.21\n\n**Assessing depressive symptoms and substance use**\n\nI\u2019m examining how the user\u2019s depressive symptoms relate to their cocaine and alcohol use. The symptoms began after starting to use cocaine regularly, and while they suggest substance-induced depression, they also persist even when the user hasn\u2019t taken cocaine for days. This complicates the primary diagnosis. Given the timeline, it seems likely that Cocaine Use Disorder might be primary, with Substance\/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder as secondary. \n\nI need to consider Major Depressive Disorder as well since the user experiences significant distress. The goal is to outline the top five diagnoses clearly:\n\n1. Cocaine Use Disorder, moderate - F14.20  \n2. Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, moderate - F32.1  \n3. Alcohol Use Disorder, mild - F10.10  \n4. Substance\/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (cocaine-induced) - F14.24  \n5. Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood - F43.21\n\n**Evaluating diagnoses for depressive symptoms**\n\nI'm considering whether the user's depressive symptoms are substance-induced due to cocaine or alcohol use. His symptoms persist across days, which fits stimulant withdrawal patterns but also aligns with major depressive disorder (MDD). Interestingly, his depressive symptoms began about three months after starting cocaine use, creating uncertainty about the timeline. I think MDD should be the primary diagnosis due to suicidal ideation. The focus will be to list the top five diagnoses clearly:\n\n1. Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, severe without psychotic features - F32.2  \n2. Cocaine Use Disorder, moderate - F14.20  \n3. Alcohol Use Disorder, mild - F10.10  \n4. Substance\/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder - F14.24  \n5. Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood - F43.21\n\n**Considering possible diagnoses**\n\nI'm assessing diagnoses for the user's emotional struggles and considering options like Generalized Anxiety Disorder and substance-induced conditions. Given the context of his work-related worries and the onset of depressive symptoms after starting cocaine and heavy drinking, I'm leaning towards including Substance\/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder as relevant. \n\nFor the top five diagnoses, I'm contemplating: \n1. Major Depressive Disorder - F32.2 \n2. Cocaine Use Disorder - F14.20 \n3. Alcohol Use Disorder - F10.20 \n4. Substance-Induced Depressive Disorder - F14.24 \n5. Alcohol-Induced Depressive Disorder - F10.14. \n\nI want to ensure clarity and relevance in this list!\n\n**Finalizing diagnostic list**\n\nI need to provide a structured list of the top five psychiatric diagnoses as per the instructions. It's important to treat this as a differential list but also acknowledge their likelihood. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of listing:  \n1. Major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate - F32.1  \n2. Cocaine use disorder, moderate - F14.20  \n3. Alcohol use disorder, mild - F10.10  \n4. Substance\/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (cocaine-induced) - F14.24  \n5. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood - F43.21  \n\nThese codes fit the DSM-5-TR guidelines and are structured correctly.",

    "vignette":"Sebastian Lopez, a 27-year-old Hispanic freelance editor, was brought to his long-time HIV clinic by his worried partner. As the patient entered the clinic waiting room, he announced, \u201cGod has cured me! I can stop my antivirals!\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. Lopez fidgeted on a chair, furiously writing on a yellow pad, his partner provided the recent history. He said that the patient had been doing well until approximately 1 month earlier. At that point, he began an unusually intense editing project. After about 10 days of little sleep, \u201cboundless energy,\u201d and activity, Mr. Lopez seemed edgy, a little pressured, and \u201cglassy-eyed.\u201d That night, the two of them went to a party to celebrate the completion of the work project. Despite several years of Narcotics Anonymous meetings and abstinence from illicit substances, Mr. Lopez took crystal methamphetamine, a stimulant. Acutely anxious and paranoid that they were being followed, Mr. Lopez drank three martinis but still did not sleep that night. Over the ensuing days the patient became less paranoid, but he appeared increasingly distracted and his speech was more pressured.\n\nMr. Lopez\u2019s work project was returned with multiple negative comments and requests for corrections. Instead of focusing on his editing, however, he stayed up late every night, intent on finding a cure for HIV. He made inappropriate, hypersexual advances toward other men at the gym, where he spent much of the day. He lost at least 5 pounds after deciding he should take vitamin supplements instead of food and his antiretroviral medication. He refused to go to the emergency room but finally agreed to come to his routine AIDS clinic appointment to show his doctors how well he had done despite not having taken his medications in over a month.\n\nMr. Lopez\u2019s psychiatric history was without a prior episode of clear-cut mania, but he had been depressed as a teenager during the early phase of his coming-out process. That episode was punctuated by a purposeful overdose and a 2-week psychiatric hospitalization and treatment with antidepressant medication and psychotherapy. Mr. Lopez had discontinued the medication because it made him \u201chyper and edgy,\u201d and he stopped the psychotherapy because \u201cit was pointless.\u201d He used methamphetamine frequently for several years, which led to recurrent unprotected intercourse with strangers.\n\nMr. Lopez was diagnosed with HIV at age 22, at which point he went to an outpatient substance use disorder rehabilitation center and discontinued his use of stimulants and alcohol. His lowest CD4 lymphocyte count had been 216 cells\/mm3, when he was age 24, at which time his viral load was 1.6 million copies. He had been reportedly adherent to his antiretroviral medications since then. His most recent CD4 count, 6 months prior to this episode, had been 526 cells\/mm3. His viral load had been undetectable. He had suffered fatigue but had not had any AIDS-defining illnesses. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain revealed mild cortical atrophy and periventricular white matter disease in excess of what would be expected for his age. The partner was unsure when Mr. Lopez had discontinued his antiretrovirals but thought it might have been months earlier. He also wondered if Mr. Lopez had \u201clost a step\u201d cognitively over the past year.\n\nHis family psychiatric history was significant for a maternal aunt who had received lithium and several courses of electroconvulsive therapy, but her diagnosis was unknown.\n\nOn examination, the patient was a sloppily dressed young man who told a pressured, disjointed story of events over the prior month. He was difficult to direct and was uncharacteristically irritable and devaluing. He was preoccupied with having discovered a cure for HIV through multivitamins and exercise. He denied hallucinations and suicidal and homicidal ideation. He refused cognitive testing, and his insight and judgment appeared poor.",

    "model_thoughts":"**Verifying ICD-10 Codes**\n\nI\u2019m checking the ICD-10 codes for stimulant-related disorders. For abuse, I have F15.10 as uncomplicated, and F15.120 for uncomplicated intoxication. There are specific codes for intoxication with delirium, perceptual disturbances, and others. I also see codes for stimulant-induced mood, psychotic, anxiety disorders, and sexual dysfunction. For dependence, F15.20 is uncomplicated, with variations for intoxication and related disorders. I\u2019ll make sure these codes are accurate for the task at hand!\n\n**Analyzing Substance Use Codes**\n\nI'm looking at the ICD-10 codes for unspecified stimulant use, starting with F15.90 for uncomplicated use. For substance-induced bipolar disorder, I could use F15.24 if it's dependence with stimulant-induced mood disorder or F15.14 for abuse. But I'm noticing DSM refers to it as \"substance-induced bipolar,\" while ICD-10 calls it \"stimulant-induced mood disorder.\" Since the case involves meth after a period of abstinence, coding it as F15.14 for abuse seems fitting. We can't list a rule-out, but as a secondary diagnosis, I could consider F06.33 or F10.20.\n\n**Examining Diagnosis Options**\n\nI'm considering diagnosis options like \"Major depressive disorder, single episode, in full remission\" or \"Other specified bipolar and related disorder.\" The background involves teenage depression treated with antidepressants, which were discontinued because they caused hyperactivity. This might indicate antidepressant-induced hypomania or early signs of bipolar disorder, especially given the family history of bipolarity. Plus, there's mention of mania possibly caused by sleep deprivation and stress, alongside psychotic symptoms like grandiose delusions. It\u2019s a complex case!\n\n**Evaluating Mania Causes**\n\nI\u2019m considering that the mania might stem from HIV-induced CNS disease, especially since the individual stopped antiretrovirals, which could have led to cognitive decline and white matter disease noticed on the MRI. However, I have to stick to the information provided, which means I can't definitively confirm the mania\u2019s medical cause, but it can be part of the differential diagnosis. I\u2019m also weighing between diagnosing \"Bipolar I disorder\" with psychotic features versus just a manic episode. Based on DSM-5 criteria, bipolar I seems appropriate. I'll go with my top five diagnoses.\n\n**Determining Diagnoses and Codes**\n\nI'm navigating through the potential diagnoses, considering \"Stimulant\/medication-induced bipolar disorder\" and what codes to use. To avoid redundancy, I\u2019m weighing whether to label it as mania due to substance use. I think both stimulant use disorder and stimulant-induced mood disorder are relevant, although listing both might seem redundant. The priority is to ensure the codes align with the most appropriate diagnosis, including bipolar I with psychotic features and substance use disorder. It's vital to confirm accuracy across the ICD-10 codes and their definitions to settle on the correct options.\n\n**Identifying Diagnoses and Codes**\n\nI'm considering the potential diagnoses for this case, especially focusing on cognitive decline and mania. The notion of including a neurocognitive disorder due to HIV is interesting, but the vignette suggests more of a mild decline, which should be reflected in the diagnosis. I think the top five diagnoses to consider would include: Bipolar I disorder with psychotic features; stimulant use disorder; alcohol use disorder; and possibly unspecified neurocognitive disorder related to HIV. I\u2019ll need to double-check the corresponding ICD-10 codes as I finalize my list.\n\n**Considering Diagnoses for Mania**\n\nI'm piecing together the possible diagnoses, especially focusing on the implications of HIV and stimulant use. I could list alcohol use disorder, but there isn't enough evidence to confirm it fully. Instead, I think about prioritizing differential diagnoses like Bipolar I disorder, stimulant-induced bipolar disorder, and neurocognitive disorders due to HIV. I\u2019ll verify the corresponding ICD-10 codes for clarity and accuracy. The five diagnoses I\u2019m leaning toward include Bipolar I disorder with psychotic features, stimulant use disorder, and others necessitating careful consideration of comorbidities.\n\n**Determining Diagnoses for Mania**\n\nI'm considering the factors contributing to the patient's manic episode, including sleep deprivation and possible meth use. The MRI findings suggest potential HIV-related CNS disease, which could lead to secondary mania. I\u2019ll prioritize the diagnoses, keeping in mind that bipolar disorder is a primary concern. \n\nI\u2019ll compile the top five likely diagnoses, including bipolar I disorder, stimulant use disorder, and neurocognitive disorder. It's a balance of addressing the acute mania, past history, and any comorbid issues the patient faces.\n\n**Analyzing Stimulant Use Disorder Diagnosis**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to approach diagnosing the patient\u2019s stimulant use disorder. Since he relapsed recently, he can\u2019t be in sustained remission anymore, even though he has a past history of SUD. The criteria require more symptoms over the last 12 months, which he might not fully meet. However, we can diagnose \"Stimulant use disorder, in early remission\" if it\u2019s within the right timeframe. \n\nI need to carefully choose DSM-5 codes, ensuring they align with the patient\u2019s history and current symptoms.\n\n**Finalizing Diagnoses and Codes**\n\nI'm determining the final list of diagnoses for the patient. He has a history of severe stimulant use disorder (SUD) but relapsed recently, so I\u2019m considering how that affects the diagnosis. We can label it as \"stimulant use disorder, severe,\" and possibly include \"substance-induced bipolar disorder\" because of the meth use.\n\nBipolar I disorder seems most likely as the primary diagnosis, with \"bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition\" as a secondary option due to possible HIV. I'll also consider unspecified neurocognitive disorder based on MRI findings. This is a complex case, but I think I can finalize the codes effectively!\n\n**Finalizing Primary and Secondary Diagnoses**\n\nI prefer using F09 for unspecified neurocognitive disorder, given the unclear aspects of the case. Major neurocognitive disorder needs significant cognitive decline evidence, which we don\u2019t have. While negative feedback on his work might indicate impairment, it could also stem from mania or overwork. He has some history with methamphetamine use, so \"stimulant use disorder\" is likely appropriate based on the information, even if confirming two criteria isn't fully feasible. Here\u2019s my final structured list of diagnoses:\n\n1. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, with psychotic features - F31.2  \n2. Stimulant (amphetamine-type) use disorder, severe - F15.20  \n3. Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition (HIV infection) - F06.33  \n4. Substance\/Medication-Induced Bipolar Disorder (methamphetamine-induced) - F15.14  \n5. Unspecified neurocognitive disorder - F09\n\n**Confirming Diagnoses and Codes**\n\nI\u2019m considering which diagnoses and codes to use, particularly focusing on the presence of psychotic features. Here\u2019s my proposed list:\n\n1. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, with psychotic features - F31.2  \n2. Stimulant (amphetamine-type) use disorder (methamphetamine), severe - F15.20  \n3. Substance\/Medication-Induced Bipolar and Related Disorder (methamphetamine-induced) - F15.14  \n4. Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition (HIV infection), with manic features - F06.33  \n5. Unspecified neurocognitive disorder - F09  \n\nI\u2019ll ensure each diagnosis has a unique code, avoiding redundancy while accurately reflecting the clinical situation.",
