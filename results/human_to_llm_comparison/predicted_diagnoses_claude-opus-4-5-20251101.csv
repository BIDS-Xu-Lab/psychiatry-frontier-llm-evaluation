181,"Terry Najarian, a 65-year-old salesman for a large corporation, presented for a psychiatric evaluation after his wife threatened to leave him. Although he said he was embarrassed to discuss his issues with a stranger, he described his sexual interest in women’s undergarments in a quite matter-of-fact manner. This interest had surfaced several years earlier and had not been a problem until he was caught masturbating by his wife 6 weeks prior to the evaluation. Upon seeing him dressed in panties and a bra, she initially “went nuts,” thinking he was having an affair. After he clarified that he was not seeing anyone else, she “shut him out” and hardly spoke to him. When they argued, she called him a “pervert” and made it clear that she was considering divorce unless he “got help.”
 
 Mr. Najarian’s habit began in the setting of his wife’s severe arthritis and likely depression, both of which significantly reduced her overall activity level and specifically her interest in sex. His “fetish” was the bright spot during his frequent and otherwise dreary business trips. He also masturbated at home but generally waited until his wife was out of the house. His specific pattern was to masturbate about twice weekly, using bras and panties that he had collected over several years. He said that intercourse with his wife had faded to “every month or two” but was mutually satisfying.
 
 The patient had been married for over 30 years, and the couple had two grown children. Mr. Najarian had planned to retire comfortably later that year, but not if the two choices were either “to be poor after we split the assets or to sit around the house all day and be called a pervert.”
 
 He became visibly anxious when discussing his marital difficulties. He described some recent difficulty falling asleep and “worried constantly” about his marriage but denied other psychiatric problems. He had made a show of throwing away a half dozen pieces of underwear, which had seemed to reassure his wife, but he had saved his “favorites” and “could always buy more.” He said he was of mixed mind. He did not want to end his marriage, but he saw nothing harmful in his new mode of masturbating. “I’m not unfaithful or doing anything bad,” he said. “It just excites me, and my wife certainly doesn’t want to be having sex a few times a week.”
 
 Mr. Najarian denied any difficulties related to sexual functioning, adding that he could maintain erections and achieve orgasm without women’s undergarments. He recalled being aroused when he touched women’s underwear as a teenager and had masturbated repeatedly to that experience. That fantasy had disappeared when he became sexually active with his wife. He denied any personal or family history of mental illness.","Let me carefully analyze this clinical case vignette to arrive at accurate DSM-5-TR diagnoses.

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

1. **Fetishistic Disorder vs. Fetishism (non-disordered)**
According to DSM-5-TR criteria for Fetishistic Disorder (F65.0):


- A. Recurrent and intense sexual arousal from use of nonliving objects or specific focus on nongenital body parts, manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors over ≥6 months
- B. The fantasies, urges, or behaviors cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning

He clearly meets Criterion A - recurrent, intense arousal from women's undergarments spanning several years with ongoing fantasies and masturbatory behaviors. The critical issue is Criterion B: he explicitly denies personal distress about the behavior itself and views it as harmless. The distress he's experiencing stems from the marital conflict and his wife's reaction, not from the sexual interest itself. This distinction is crucial—the criterion requires distress or impairment directly attributable to the paraphilic interest, not secondary consequences from relationship conflict.

The DSM-5-TR differentiates between a paraphilia (the sexual interest pattern) and a paraphilic disorder (which requires either personal distress unrelated to societal disapproval, or harm to others). Since he lacks intrinsic distress about the behavior and it doesn't involve non-consenting individuals, this appears to be fetishism as a paraphilia rather than fetishistic disorder. That said, the marital dysfunction is creating significant secondary distress that warrants clinical attention.

Regarding whether this is transvestic disorder or fetishistic disorder, the distinction hinges on the source of arousal. His teenage history shows arousal from touching the garments themselves, and his current descriptions emphasize the objects as the primary source of sexual interest. While he does wear the items during masturbation, the focus seems to be on the undergarments as objects rather than on cross-dressing as an identity or presentation. This pattern points more toward fetishistic disorder, though the wearing component could be noted as an associated feature.

The anxiety and sleep disturbance appear directly tied to his wife's discovery and threat of divorce—a clear, recent stressor. His constant worry about the marriage and difficulty falling asleep fit an adjustment disorder presentation better than generalized anxiety disorder, since the symptoms are specifically anchored to this identifiable event rather than pervasive worry across multiple domains. Insomnia is also present but seems secondary to the acute stress response.

The core diagnostic question centers on whether he meets criteria for a paraphilic disorder. He doesn't experience personal distress about the cross-dressing itself—he's matter-of-fact about it—and there's no indication of harm to others. The distress he's experiencing stems from his wife's reaction and the marital consequences, not from the paraphilia itself. The DSM-5-TR is clear that social disapproval alone doesn't satisfy criterion B; the distress must be about the paraphilic interest itself. His embarrassment about discussing it doesn't change this distinction.

The primary diagnostic consideration is whether the significant marital impairment could constitute the required social functioning impairment for a paraphilic disorder diagnosis. This is genuinely borderline. Alternatively, he may have a paraphilia without meeting disorder criteria, though DSM-5-TR doesn't provide a code for that distinction. The adjustment disorder with anxiety symptoms—including sleep disturbance and worry about the marriage—appears to be the clearer diagnosis given his stress response to the marital conflict. stress response to the marital conflict. The cross-dressing component warrants consideration of Transvestic Disorder, though his arousal pattern—beginning with tactile contact with underwear rather than wearing them—aligns more closely with Fetishistic Disorder. DSM-5-TR specifies that Fetishistic Disorder excludes clothing worn during sexual activity, which creates some diagnostic ambiguity here given his current practice of wearing women's underwear during masturbation.

The presentation suggests elements of both: the wearing behavior points toward Transvestic Disorder, while his collection and focus on the garments themselves suggest a fetishistic component. Transvestic Disorder can include a ""with fetishism"" specifier when arousal involves specific fabrics or materials. Given his history of tactile arousal preceding the wearing behavior, combined with his current cross-dressing during sexual activity, Transvestic Disorder appears most appropriate, potentially with the fetishism specifier.

For the diagnostic formulation, I'm weighing whether the primary pattern centers on the act of wearing or the objects themselves. The collection behavior and early tactile arousal suggest object-focused arousal, which would favor Fetishistic Disorder as the primary diagnosis. However, the prominent cross-dressing behavior during masturbation indicates Transvestic Disorder may be more central. I'll prioritize Fetishistic Disorder given the strong object focus and collection pattern, with Transvestic Disorder as an alternative consideration for the wearing component.

The secondary diagnoses include Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety for the clear stress response, Generalized Anxiety Disorder for broader anxiety symptoms, and Insomnia Disorder for the sleep difficulties. Now I need to verify whether he actually meets the distress criterion for Fetishistic Disorder—specifically whether he experiences clinically significant impairment or distress. He's indicated he doesn't view this negatively himself, which raises an important question about whether the diagnostic threshold is truly met. The diagnostic picture includes several conditions beyond the primary paraphilic concern. His anxiety symptoms warrant attention—both the adjustment reaction to the marital crisis and what appears to be more generalized worry. Sleep disturbance is also present, likely stemming from the relationship stress and underlying anxiety. Additionally, cross-dressing behavior may warrant consideration as a separate diagnostic entity depending on the clinical presentation and whether it causes independent distress.","1.

62,"A 27-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of convulsions.
 The patient had been in his usual state of health until 2 years before this admission, when shaking of the trunk, arms, and legs occurred. The episode lasted approximately 4 to 5 minutes and had been preceded by a sharp pain in the back of the head that radiated to the neck, blurred vision, palpitations, nausea, and difficulty concentrating. The patient did not seek evaluation, and no additional convulsive episodes occurred during the subsequent 20 months.
 Four months before this admission, while the patient was drinking alcohol at a party, his body suddenly became stiff, and he fell backward onto a table. Shaking of the trunk, arms, and legs occurred for approximately 5 to 8 minutes. He had urinary incontinence but did not bite his tongue. Five minutes later, similar convulsions occurred. The patient was taken to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. The results of computed tomography of the head were normal, as was an electroencephalogram (EEG) that was obtained over a period of 40 minutes. Treatment with levetiracetam was started. The patient was discharged home with a recommendation for follow-up evaluation at the neurology clinic of the other hospital.
 Three months before this admission, the patient was evaluated at the neurology clinic of the other hospital. He reported that despite the use of levetiracetam, convulsions occurred approximately once per week. The results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, were reportedly normal. Treatment with lamotrigine was started. There was no change in the quality or frequency of the convulsive episodes.
 One month before this admission, while the patient was at work, his colleagues found him on the floor, and they witnessed “shaking and clenching” movements of the trunk, arms, and legs that lasted approximately 2 minutes. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was taken to the emergency department of a second hospital for evaluation.
 At least two additional convulsive episodes occurred at the second hospital. During one episode, the shaking movements became less intense when the physician’s hand was placed on the patient’s shoulder; the movements resumed at the previous intensity when the hand was removed. In addition, the patient’s eyes were closed. When the eyelids were opened manually, no nystagmus or gaze deviation was present. When the eyelids were released, the eyes shut forcefully and Bell’s phenomenon (upward deviation of the eyes when closing) occurred. The patient did not speak but was able to follow simple verbal commands, such as an instruction to squeeze the physician’s hands. In between the convulsive episodes, there were intermittent rocking movements of the upper body and nonrhythmic tremulous movements of the hands, and the patient did not speak or follow commands. After several hours, the episodes stopped, and the patient was able to speak. Admission to the hospital was recommended; however, the patient declined because of work obligations and anxiety about being in the hospital. He was discharged home.
 During the subsequent month, the patient continued to take levetiracetam and lamotrigine. However, the convulsions increased in frequency to one to three times per week.
 On the morning before the current admission, while the patient was at work, his colleagues noticed that he abruptly stopped speaking and began to have shaking movements of the arms and legs. Emergency medical services were called. On their arrival, the patient’s body was stiff, and there was twitching of the trunk, arms, and legs. No urinary or fecal incontinence or biting of the tongue had occurred. The patient was able to stand up from a chair and walk to the ambulance. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital.
 On examination, the temperature was 36.2°C, the blood pressure 111/56 mm Hg, the pulse 83 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was awake and alert but did not speak. His eyes were open, with a primary midline gaze and blinking in response to visual threat. His body appeared stiff, with the arms and legs straightened. There were intermittent nonrhythmic tremulous movements of the trunk, arms, and legs. The patient was able to follow complex commands and to move the arms and legs symmetrically and against gravity, but there was a delay in motor activation. The deep-tendon reflexes were normal. Extensive scarring from burns was present on the face, trunk, back, arms, and legs.
 Approximately 45 minutes after the tremulous movements had stopped, the patient was able to speak but with limited fluency. Additional history was obtained. He had been taking levetiracetam and lamotrigine as directed; however, 3 days before this evaluation, he had stopped taking these medications because he was unsure whether they were effective. That morning, he had felt well until he noticed a sharp pain in the back of his head that radiated to his neck, along with sudden blurred vision, full-body numbness, and difficulty concentrating. A convulsive episode then occurred that lasted up to 20 minutes; during the episode, the patient was aware of events but sometimes had difficulty hearing. He described his overall mood as “pretty good” and did not report decreased energy or chronic fatigue. There was no history of psychotic or manic symptoms, suicidal ideation, or obsessive or compulsive behaviors.
 The patient had a history of a febrile seizure in childhood, as well as several concussions that had occurred while he was playing sports in childhood. He reported that during the first 6 years of life, his social supports were limited, and he had experienced maltreatment by a family member; he did not elaborate on the nature of the maltreatment. In late childhood, he was involved in a house fire and hospitalized for a prolonged period because of severe burns on the face, body, arms, and legs. He had asthma, major depressive disorder, chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and panic disorder with agoraphobia. He took escitalopram daily and lorazepam as needed for panic attacks. He was in a long-term romantic relationship. He did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs; he smoked marijuana approximately once per year and drank one alcoholic beverage per week. His father had died of heart disease when the patient was a teenager; his mother had schizoaffective disorder and post-traumatic epilepsy.
 Blood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The blood lactate level was 2.4 mmol per liter (22 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.2 mmol per liter [5 to 20 mg per deciliter]) and the blood creatine kinase level 489 U per liter (reference range, 60 to 400). Serum and urine toxicologic panels were negative. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was admitted to this hospital.","Let me analyze this clinical case vignette carefully to extract the relevant information and develop a differential diagnosis.

On examination:
- Vital signs normal
- Awake, alert, did not speak
- Eyes open, midline gaze, blinks to visual threat
- Body appeared stiff, arms/legs straightened
- Intermittent nonrhythmic tremulous movements of trunk, arms, legs
- ABLE TO FOLLOW COMPLEX COMMANDS
- Could move arms/legs symmetrically against gravity (delay in motor activation)
- Deep tendon reflexes normal
- Extensive burn scarring on face, trunk, back, arms, legs

Post-episode (45 min after tremulous movements stopped):
- Able to speak with limited fluency
- Stopped medications 3 days prior

The episode started abruptly with sharp occipital pain radiating to the neck, followed by sudden vision changes and widespread numbness. The convulsive movements lasted around 20 minutes, and notably the patient remained aware throughout despite some hearing difficulty. Current mood is stable without depressive symptoms, fatigue, or psychotic features. History includes childhood febrile seizure and multiple head injuries from sports, plus significant trauma from early maltreatment and severe burns requiring prolonged hospitalization. Current diagnoses include Major Depressive Disorder, PTSD, and Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia. Was taking Escitalopram before discontinuing it three days ago. EEG normal. The presentation strongly suggests Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder with seizures—specifically psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. Several clinical features point to this: the patient maintains responsiveness and awareness during episodes, keeps eyes forcefully closed (atypical for true seizures), and shows decreased movements when I apply gentle pressure, resuming when I remove it. There's no genuine post-ictal period, as she walks normally immediately after episodes end.

The medication history is telling—two antiepileptic drugs at therapeutic doses produced no benefit and actually worsened symptoms, which wouldn't occur with genuine epilepsy. Imaging and EEG are completely normal. Her movements lack the rhythmic, synchronized quality of epileptic seizures, instead appearing variable and asynchronous, lasting anywhere from 2 to 20 minutes. Multiple psychological stressors underlie this presentation: documented PTSD from childhood maltreatment and a severe house fire requiring extended hospitalization, along with panic disorder and major depression.

The prodromal symptoms—palpitations, sharp headache, blurred vision, concentration difficulties, nausea—align with panic attack physiology rather than seizure semiology. Mild lactate and CK elevations reflect muscle exertion during episodes but don't indicate true seizure activity. Given the constellation of findings, this presentation most strongly suggests Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder with seizure-like attacks, supported by positive PNES signs on examination and the clear psychiatric and trauma-related risk factors present.

The differential includes several documented conditions: chronic PTSD stemming from childhood maltreatment and severe trauma exposure; panic disorder with agoraphobia, for which she takes lorazepam as needed; and major depressive disorder currently in remission, managed with escitalopram. Each of these underlying psychiatric conditions is a recognized risk factor for the development of functional neurological symptoms. The patient's current mood is reported as ""pretty good"" with no energy loss, suggesting either partial or full remission of the depressive episode. PTSD remains a significant comorbidity that likely contributes to the functional neurological symptoms. Panic disorder and agoraphobia are also documented conditions that compound the clinical picture, though the primary diagnosis explaining the presenting seizure-like episodes is the functional neurological symptom disorder itself. For the depression diagnosis, given he's on escitalopram with reported good mood, partial remission seems most fitting—F33.41 captures this appropriately. I should verify the ICD-10 codes align: F44.5 for conversion disorder with seizures, F43.10-F43.12 for PTSD variants (with F43.12 specifying chronic), F33.1 for moderate recurrent depression, and F33.41 for recurrent with partial remission. F41.0 covers panic disorder.

Since the case explicitly notes chronic PTSD, F43.12 is the correct specification. The final diagnoses are: Conversion Disorder with Seizures (F44.5), Chronic PTSD (F43.12), Recurrent Major Depression in Partial Remission (F33.41), Panic Disorder (F41.0), and Agoraphobia (F40.00).","1.

169,"Only upon the repeated and fervent insistence of her parents did 19-year-old Emily reluctantly agree to see a psychiatrist. “It’s not me you want to see,” Emily proclaimed emphatically. “It’s my insane parents who need your help.” Emily did not offer a chief complaint, aside from the concern that her parents were driving her “crazy.” She added, “Everything is going great in my life. I have plenty of friends, go out almost every night, and always have lots of fun.”
 
 While Emily was taking some time away from “the so-called real world,” her sister was attending Duke University, her younger brother was excelling at a competitive private high school, and both her parents seemed to enjoy their careers as radiologists. She asked, “Don’t you think that’s enough strivers for one family?”
 
 Emily agreed to have her parents join the session, and they told a different story. They tearfully disclosed that their daughter had become irritable, unproductive, and oppositional. She drank to intoxication almost every night, often not returning home for an entire weekend. In searching her room, they had found small amounts of marijuana, alprazolam (Xanax), cocaine, and prescription stimulants. The parents described the changes in Emily’s personality as “an adolescent nightmare” and described her friends as “losers who do nothing but dye their hair, get tattoos, and hate everything.” Emily’s attitudes and behavior contrasted markedly with those of her parents and siblings. “We don’t mind that she is doing her own thing and that she isn’t conservative like the rest of us,” her father said, “but it’s like we don’t even recognize who she’s become.”
 
 According to her parents, Emily’s “adolescent nightmare” began 4 years earlier. She had apparently been a studious 15-year-old girl with a lively sense of humor and a wide circle of “terrific friends.” “Almost overnight,” she began to shun her longtime friends in favor of “dropouts and malcontents” and began to accumulate traffic tickets and school detentions. Instead of her former bright-eyed curiosity, Emily manifested a lack of interest in all her academic subjects, and her grades dropped from As to Ds. The parents were at an absolute loss to explain the sudden and dramatic change.
 
 The abrupt change in performance led the psychiatrist to ask Emily to take a battery of neuropsychological tests so the results could be compared with those of tests that she had taken when she had applied to a private high school several years earlier. In particular, Emily retook two high school admissions tests: the System for Assessment and Group Evaluation (SAGE), which measures a broad array of academic and perceptual aptitudes, and the Differential Aptitude Tests (DAT), which focus on reasoning, spelling, and perceptual skills.
 
 On the SAGE, her average percentile scores dropped from the upper 10% for a 13-year-old to the bottom 10% for an adult (and the bottom 20% for a 13-year-old). When Emily took the DAT at age 13, she scored in the highest range for ninth graders across almost all measures. Her worst result had been in spelling, where she scored at the second-highest level. Upon repeating the test at age 19, she scored below the high school average in all measures.
 
 EEG, brain CT, and T2-weighted brain MRI scans showed no evidence of structural brain damage. However, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) T2-weighted MRI displayed a clear lesion in the left frontal cortex, highly suggestive of previous injury to that region.
 
 Upon further questioning about the crucial period in which she seemed to have changed, Emily admitted to being in a traffic accident with her now ex-boyfriend, Mark. Although Emily did not recall much from this episode, she remembered that she hit her head and that she had bad headaches for many weeks thereafter. Because Emily was not bleeding and there was no damage to the car, neither Mark nor Emily reported the incident to anyone. With Emily’s permission, the psychiatrist contacted Mark, who was away at college but a willing and excellent historian. He remembered the incident well. “Emily hit her head very, very hard on the dashboard of my car. She was not totally unconscious but very dazed. For about 3 hours, she spoke very slowly, complained that her head hurt badly, and was confused. For about 2 hours she didn’t know where she was or what day it was. She also threw up twice. I was really scared, but Emily didn’t want me to worry her parents since they’re so overprotective. And then she broke up with me, and we’ve hardly spoken since.”","Let me carefully analyze this clinical case vignette to provide an accurate diagnosis.

6. Neuropsychological Testing Results:
- Dramatic decline in cognitive functioning
- SAGE scores dropped from upper 10% (at 13) to bottom 10% (at 19)
- DAT scores: previously highest range for 9th graders, now below high school average in all measures


- Neuroimaging shows no structural abnormalities on standard EEG, CT, or conventional MRI, but FLAIR sequences reveal a lesion in the left frontal cortex consistent with prior traumatic injury. The clinical presentation—acute altered consciousness with post-traumatic amnesia and prolonged headaches following the motor vehicle accident—combined with documented cognitive decline and the neuroimaging findings pointing to frontal lobe involvement strongly support a diagnosis of Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Traumatic Brain Injury.

The left frontal damage accounts for the behavioral and cognitive sequelae: personality changes, disinhibition, poor judgment, impulsivity, and irritability, along with the significant academic deterioration and oppositional conduct. The magnitude of cognitive decline—from high-average to low-average performance on testing—meets criteria for the major rather than mild presentation. DSM-5-TR diagnostic requirements include documented cognitive decline from baseline, functional impairment in daily activities, absence of delirium as the primary cause, and evidence of TBI as the etiology.

The behavioral disturbance specifier applies given the prominent personality alterations and emotional dysregulation. Beyond the primary neurocognitive diagnosis, multiple substance use patterns warrant attention: alcohol consumed to intoxication nightly (moderate-severe severity), cannabis use, benzodiazepine dependence on alprazolam, and cocaine and stimulant involvement. The personality changes secondary to the brain injury could be coded separately or incorporated within the NCD framework.

For coding purposes, the major neurocognitive disorder due to TBI requires the underlying traumatic brain injury to be coded first using S06 codes, with F02.81 capturing the major NCD presentation with behavioral disturbance. When coding only F-codes as requested, F02.81 represents the major neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition with behavioral manifestations.

The clinical presentation supports this primary diagnosis given the clear temporal relationship between the TBI and symptom onset, documented cognitive decline on neuropsychological testing, neuroimaging evidence of frontal lobe involvement, and behavioral changes consistent with frontal lobe pathology. F07.0 could serve as an alternative if the personality change is the predominant feature. Additional substance use diagnoses would include moderate to severe alcohol use disorder (F10.20), cannabis use disorder (F12.10 or F12.20), and cocaine use disorder (F14.10 or F14.20).

For the remaining substance use patterns, sedative/hypnotic/anxiolytic use disorder related to alprazolam use (F13.10 or F13.20) and other stimulant use disorder (F15.10 or F15.20) should be documented. The final diagnostic formulation prioritizes the neurocognitive disorder from TBI as the primary condition, with substance use disorders coded by severity based on available evidence—moderate alcohol use, mild cocaine use given limited documentation, mild cannabis use, and mild sedative use. The alternative diagnosis of personality change due to medical condition remains clinically relevant depending on whether personality alterations or cognitive decline predominates in the clinical picture. ant Use Disorder, Mild

The case presents a choice between emphasizing the cognitive decline versus the personality changes as primary. Given the dramatic drop in cognitive functioning—from the upper 10th percentile to the bottom 10th—this clearly represents major rather than mild neurocognitive disorder. For the substance use disorders, the alcohol use appears more severe given the nightly intoxication pattern, while the other substances show only mild involvement based on small amounts detected.

Reconsidering the diagnostic hierarchy, the personality and behavioral disturbances are actually the most salient clinical features, which raises the question of whether F07.0 should take precedence. The distinction matters: personality change due to medical condition involves a persistent shift from baseline personality, whereas neurocognitive disorder emphasizes cognitive decline. Both are present here, but the behavioral manifestations seem to dominate the clinical picture.

Given that the cognitive testing was ordered to investigate the sudden behavioral changes rather than the reverse, and the parents' primary concern centers on personality shifts, there's a case for F07.0 as primary. However, F02.81 with behavioral disturbance specification captures the full clinical picture—both the documented cognitive decline and the behavioral symptoms—making it the more comprehensive primary diagnosis. The substance use disorders follow as secondary diagnoses.

For the remaining substance use conditions, I need to prioritize. Alcohol Use Disorder is clearly most significant. Among cannabis, cocaine, sedatives, and prescription stimulants, I should select the three most clinically relevant. The stimulant use disorder warrants inclusion since prescription stimulants were identified, and I'll add cocaine and cannabis use disorders based on their presence in the case. This gives me:

1. F02.81 - Major Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Traumatic Brain Injury, With Behavioral Disturbance
2. F10.20 - Alcohol Use Disorder, Moderate

I should verify whether adding the personality change diagnosis creates redundancy with the behavioral disturbance specifier already coded in the NCD. According to DSM-5-TR, Personality Change Due to Another Medical Condition shouldn't be diagnosed when the disturbance is better explained by another condition, including NCD. Since the behavioral changes are captured by the NCD with behavioral disturbance specifier, the personality change diagnosis would be redundant and shouldn't be included.

The final diagnostic picture centers on the major neurocognitive disorder from traumatic brain injury with behavioral disturbance, along with the three substance use disorders. The TBI accounts for the cognitive decline and personality shifts, while the substance use disorders—particularly the moderate alcohol use—likely reflect common consequences of frontal lobe damage like impaired judgment and disinhibition. I should also consider whether a sedative/hypnotic use disorder might be present given the clinical presentation.","1.

155,"Lucas Sandahl, a 32-year-old landscape architect, presented to a psychiatrist for help with anger. He came to the office with his wife, the mother of their two young children. The couple agreed that Mr. Sandahl had become “almost impossible to live with.” Mrs. Sandahl reported that although she had always considered her husband “high-strung,” his outbursts were increasing in both frequency and intensity, and she worried that he would become violent with her.
 
 Their most recent argument began when Mr. Sandahl came home after a “hard day at work” to find that dinner was not ready. When he entered the kitchen and saw his wife sitting at the table reading the newspaper, he “exploded” and launched into a tirade about how “bad” a wife she was. When Mrs. Sandahl tried to explain her own long day, Mr. Sandahl cursed at her and broke glassware and a kitchen chair. Terrified, she ran out of the kitchen, gathered up the toddlers, and left for her mother’s house a few miles away. The next day, she told her husband that he would need to get help immediately or prepare for a divorce.
 
 Mr. Sandahl said his “blowups” began in childhood but did not become “problematic” for him until age 13. At about that time, he started having frequent fights with classmates that would occasionally result in trips to the principal’s office. In between the altercations, he was active socially and a solid student.
 
 Mr. Sandahl estimated that he had had approximately four verbal outbursts a week in recent years, generally in response to frustration, unexpected demands, or perceived insults. In addition to these heated verbal tussles, Mr. Sandahl described acts of violence about every 2 months; for example, he threw a computer monitor across the room when it started “acting up,” he kicked a hole in a wall when one of his children would not quit crying, and he destroyed his mobile phone during an argument with his mother. He denied physical fights since his adolescence, although he had nearly come to blows with a neighbor as well as an assortment of strangers and employees. The idea that he might physically hurt someone scared Mr. Sandahl “to the core.”
 
 These outbursts blighted his relationships with colleagues and romantic partners and led to his decision to start his own landscaping company at age 25. The business had done well, despite his demanding style and “hair-trigger” temper that led to high employee turnover.
 
 Mr. Sandahl described the episodes as short-lived, reaching a peak within seconds and rarely lasting more than a few minutes. Between episodes, he described himself as feeling “fine.” He had experienced brief periods of depressed mood and increased anxiety, but these had not impaired him significantly and tended to resolve on their own within a week. Mr. Sandahl drank socially, but neither he nor his wife linked the outbursts to the alcohol. He had a history of experimentation with various drugs of abuse, but not in recent years.
 
 Mr. Sandahl reported at least two other immediate family members with significant “anger issues.” His father was emotionally abusive and perfectionistic, expecting “great things” from his only son. Mr. Sandahl’s older sister also had problems with her temper; he attributed her three divorces to her emotionally abusive behavior.
 
 On examination, Mr. Sandahl was casually dressed, cooperative, and coherent. He was worried about his behavior and contrite toward his wife. He denied depression, psychosis, and confusion. He denied any thoughts of hurting himself or others. He was cognitively intact. His insight and judgment were good during the course of the interview.","Let me carefully analyze this clinical case vignette to arrive at an accurate diagnosis.

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

**Primary Consideration: Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) - F63.81**

DSM-5-TR Criteria for IED:
A. Recurrent behavioral outbursts representing a failure to control aggressive impulses as manifested by either:
   1. Verbal aggression or physical aggression toward property, animals, or other individuals, occurring twice weekly on average for 3 months, without resulting in property damage or physical injury
   OR
   2. Three behavioral outbursts involving property destruction and/or physical assault with injury to animals or others within a 12-month period

B. The aggressiveness during outbursts is grossly disproportionate to any provocation or precipitating stressors.

C. Outbursts are not premeditated and lack any tangible objective.

D. Aggressive episodes cause marked distress, occupational or interpersonal impairment, or result in financial or legal consequences.

E. Individual is at least 6 years old.

F

. The aggressive outbursts aren't attributable to another mental disorder, medical condition, or substance effects. This patient clearly meets criteria—verbal outbursts occurring 4 times weekly, physical aggression with property destruction roughly every 2 months, reactions vastly exceeding the trigger (like anger over dinner timing), explosive without planning, and causing significant interpersonal dysfunction. At 32 with onset at 13, and with no current mood disorder, psychosis, or substance involvement explaining the pattern, other diagnoses like Borderline Personality Disorder warrant consideration despite some overlapping features around anger and impulsivity.

However, the absence of identity disturbance, chronic emptiness, abandonment preoccupation, self-harm, or dissociative episodes makes BPD less likely—particularly given the patient reports feeling stable between incidents and demonstrates good insight. Antisocial Personality Disorder also doesn't fit well; while irritability and aggression are present with adolescent onset, the patient shows genuine remorse, expresses fear about harming others, and lacks the conduct disorder history, deceitfulness, or manipulative patterns characteristic of ASPD. Adult Antisocial Behavior would be a V-code rather than a primary diagnosis. Unspecified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder remains in the differential.

Adjustment Disorder with Disturbance of Conduct doesn't apply since the presentation is chronic rather than tied to a specific stressor. Bipolar Disorder is ruled out—the depressive episodes are brief and non-impairing, with no manic or hypomanic episodes, and the outbursts occur independently of mood states. Similarly, Major Depressive Disorder doesn't meet criteria given the minimal depressive symptoms. ADHD warrants consideration given the ""high-strung"" presentation and impulsivity, though this would need further assessment.

Regarding ADHD, there's no documented attention difficulties and the person was academically successful, so while comorbidity remains possible, it's not the primary concern. Generalized Anxiety Disorder is ruled out—anxiety episodes are brief, non-impairing, and resolve within a week. Other personality disorders like Narcissistic or Paranoid PD don't have sufficient evidence to support diagnosis.

The primary diagnosis is Intermittent Explosive Disorder, which clearly satisfies all diagnostic criteria. Secondary considerations include an Unspecified Personality Disorder given some personality features like demandingness and a hair-trigger temper that don't fully align with any single specific disorder, and Borderline Personality Disorder warrants evaluation. 4. **Antisocial Personality Disorder - F60.2** - irritability and aggression present since adolescence, though the remorse and concern about harming others make this less likely

5. **Unspecified Anxiety Disorder - F41.9** - brief anxiety episodes noted in the presentation

The clinical picture most strongly supports Intermittent Explosive Disorder as the primary diagnosis, with secondary consideration for personality disorder features that reflect the demanding nature, low frustration tolerance, and relational difficulties. The family history of emotional dysregulation and the episodic mood symptoms also warrant documentation. specified) - though the ADHD presentation seems less prominent given the clinical picture.

The key clinical features really point toward IED as primary: the episodic nature of outbursts, preserved insight and remorse, and absence of pervasive personality dysfunction. While personality pathology remains in the differential given the adolescent aggression history, the patient's good reality testing and genuine contrition make this less likely as a primary diagnosis. I'm settling on IED as the leading diagnosis with borderline and antisocial personality disorders as important considerations given the impulsivity and aggression pattern, followed by other specified personality disorder and adult ADHD as less likely alternatives.","1.

32,"J is a mid-20s military service member living independently in the community with a partner. J has a history of multiple ACEs (ACE scale score of 10/10), with caregivers that were both physically and emotionally abusive when J's needs were voiced, resulting in a belief that it was unacceptable, unsafe, and futile to resolve interpersonal problems with caregivers, thus creating a sense of powerlessness and helplessness. Child and family services were never involved, and no legal charges were ever laid against the family for the abuse that J endured. J struggled with containing anger since early childhood resulting in physical and verbal aggression towards peers and teachers at school and family members at home. Caregivers attempted to contain J's aggressive behavior through forced administration of psychiatric medication. While growing up, J feared others and preferred to be alone, despite longing for family and friends. Socialization with peers proved difficult, as J was easily overwhelmed by noise associated with social contact and was frequently ridiculed or misunderstood while trying to verbally communicate.
 
 As a young adult, J left family to enter the military, which became an immediate source of attachment and social belonging. More recently, J became increasingly unable to cope with anger following an ill-suited work position and a musculoskeletal injury, resulting in frequent angry verbal altercations and threats of violence towards military peers who placed restrictions on his activities. This led to disciplinary action and isolation from the unit, which further increased anger, hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts and led to a psychiatric military assessment. During the assessment, J disclosed feelings of intense anger which eventually manifested in an attack on a family member in an amnestic dissociated state. J's history indicated that pharmacological treatments had either been ineffective or caused significant side effects. The military psychiatrist determined J ought to be considered for military discharge. This triggered flashbacks of past childhood abuse and a significant increase in rage. J refused trials of psychiatric medications in the community due to a childhood history of forced medication administration. Due to significant safety concerns and limited ability to control aggressive behavior in the community, J's military psychiatrist referred J for an inpatient admission.
 
 On initial assessment for admission, J appeared distrustful, angry, and concerned about acting out on anger and expressed suicidal ideation. On mental status examination, J was tall and appeared neatly dressed in a military uniform. J appeared hypervigilant and intensely watchful and was well spoken, using a “sharp” tone of voice. J provided a detailed history, demonstrating a goal-directed thought form and a high level of abstract thinking, logical analysis, and good recall. There were no delusions or hallucinations, but J endorsed prominent active suicidal ideation, with intent to act upon these thoughts if not hospitalized; however, there were no immediate, specific suicide plans.","Let me analyze this clinical case vignette systematically to arrive at the most appropriate diagnoses.

**Data Extraction and Organization:**

**Demographics:**
- Mid-20s military service member
- Living independently with partner
- Currently facing potential military discharge

**Developmental/Historical Factors:**
- ACE score 10/10 (maximum adverse childhood experiences)
- Physical and emotional abuse by caregivers
- Learned that expressing needs was ""unacceptable, unsafe, and futile""
- Developed sense of powerlessness and helplessness
- No child protective services involvement
- History of forced psychiatric medication administration in childhood
- Struggled with anger containment since early childhood
- Physical and verbal aggression toward peers, teachers, family members
- Feared others, preferred isolation despite longing for connection
- Easily overwhelmed by noise in social situations
- Frequently ridiculed or misunderstood when communicating verbally
- Social difficulties throughout childhood

**Recent Precipitants:**
- Ill-suited work position
- Musculoskeletal injury
- Restrictions placed on activities by military peers
- Disciplinary action and isolation from unit
- Potential military discharge (major trigger)

**Current Presentation:**
- Frequent angry verbal altercations
- Threats of violence toward military peers
- Attack on family member in ""amnestic dissociated state""
- Flashbacks of past childhood abuse
- Significant increase in rage
- Suicidal ideation with intent but no specific plan
- Hopelessness
- Hypervigilance
- Intense watchfulness
- Distrustful
- Concerned about acting out on anger
- Refuses psychiatric medications due to childhood trauma

**Mental Status Examination:**
- Appearance: Tall, neatly dressed in military uniform

- Thought process: Goal-directed, high level of abstract thinking, logical analysis


- Thought content: No delusions, suicidal ideation with intent
- Perception: No hallucinations
- Cognition: Good recall
- Insight: Appears to have some insight (concerned about acting out)

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

1. **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)** - F43.10
Strong evidence:
- Extensive childhood trauma (ACE score 10/10)
- Flashbacks of past childhood abuse
- Hypervigilance
- Dissociative symptoms (amnestic dissociated state during violent episode)
- Avoidance behaviors
- Negative alterations in cognition and mood (hopelessness, powerlessness). The military discharge appears to have triggered re-traumatization, with subsequent increases in anger outbursts and hypervigilance.

2. **Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED)** - F63.81
Pattern of recurrent aggressive outbursts—both verbal altercations and physical violence toward family—that suggest failure to control impulses. This has been present since childhood, though it's important to determine whether PTSD better accounts for these episodes.

3. **Dissociative Disorder** - F44.0 or F44.9
The amnestic dissociated state during the violent episode warrants consideration, though this may represent a dissociative feature of PTSD rather than a separate disorder.

Suicidal ideation is present and would be coded as a focus of clinical attention. Several personality patterns emerge: intense, uncontrollable anger with unstable relationships and identity disturbance align with Borderline Personality Disorder (F60.3), while longstanding distrust and hypervigilance suggest Paranoid Personality Disorder (F60.0). Childhood abuse history increases risk for both. The overall presentation—emotional dysregulation, dissociation, aggression, and trauma response—reflects complex trauma, which in DSM-5-TR is captured within the PTSD diagnosis rather than as a separate category.

Adjustment Disorder seems less fitting given how entrenched these symptoms are, though recent stressors have intensified them. Autism Spectrum Disorder (F84.0) warrants consideration due to lifelong social difficulties, sensory sensitivity to noise in social settings, communication challenges, and preference for solitude, though this requires further assessment. Major Depressive Disorder (F32.x/F33.x) is present with hopelessness and suicidal intent, but these symptoms appear secondary to trauma rather than primary mood pathology.

PTSD (F43.10) emerges as the primary diagnosis, best accounting for the full clinical picture: documented trauma exposure from childhood abuse and recent assault,

re-experiencing through flashbacks, avoidance behaviors including refusal of medications tied to childhood forced administration, negative cognitive and mood changes reflecting helplessness and self-blame, hyperarousal manifesting as hypervigilance and explosive anger, and dissociative features. The severity and dissociative episode suggest possible PTSD with dissociative subtype, though the amnestic gap during the violent incident may represent dissociative amnesia occurring alongside the PTSD.

Intermittent Explosive Disorder (F63.81) also fits the longstanding pattern of disproportionate anger and aggression since childhood, with verbal and physical outbursts exceeding what the situation warrants.

Personality pathology appears present through chronic emotional dysregulation, intense anger, unstable relationships, identity disturbance (military as source of belonging), dissociation, and suicidal ideation—suggesting either Borderline Personality Disorder (F60.3) or an unspecified personality disorder (F60.9) shaped by complex trauma.

The amnestic dissociated state during the attack warrants consideration of Dissociative Amnesia (F44.0) as a distinct diagnosis. Additionally, Major Depressive Episode should be evaluated given the suicidal ideation with clear intent and plan.

I'm also considering whether Autism Spectrum Disorder (F84.0) might be relevant—the sensory sensitivities to noise, social communication difficulties, and lifelong preference for isolation could point toward this. The case notes social struggles since childhood, being easily overwhelmed by sensory input, and feeling frequently misunderstood, which align with autism presentations.

My working differential includes: PTSD as primary, Intermittent Explosive Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder features, Dissociative Amnesia, and Major Depressive Disorder—though Autism Spectrum Disorder warrants serious consideration given the developmental and sensory profile.

I should also evaluate whether PTSD with dissociative subtype better captures the presentation than listing dissociative amnesia separately, since the dissociative subtype specifically involves depersonalization/derealization rather than memory loss. The amnesia diagnosis may still be appropriate as a distinct condition depending on the clinical picture.

For the final diagnostic list, PTSD is more specific than an unspecified trauma-related disorder. Regarding the depression diagnosis, the presence of hopelessness and suicidal intent suggests at least moderate severity rather than unspecified, though I need to ensure the full MDD criteria are met before finalizing the severity level.

I'm also weighing whether to include Autism Spectrum Disorder given the longstanding social difficulties, sensory sensitivities to noise, and communication challenges. However, these features could stem from the severe childhood trauma rather than autism itself, and without clear evidence of restricted or repetitive behaviors, I'll hold off on adding that diagnosis.

The five diagnoses I'm most confident about are PTSD, Intermittent Explosive Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, Dissociative Amnesia, and Major Depressive Disorder at moderate severity.","1. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder - F43.10

1013,"Ben is a 12 month old infant that presented for a well check to their new pediatrician. Ben’s father indicates the Ben has been without any recent infections or sick exposures, and is up-to-date on immunizations. Ben’s father does recount that “Ben looks very different from our other children. His eyes seem to be space father apart, and his ears look much lower than his siblings when they were babies.” Ben’s father also indicates, “we have a hard time leaving him alone for more than 1 minute before he starts crying loudly; his cry sounds very much like a cat.” Ben was born at 4 lbs 5 oz and had to spend about 1 week in the neonatal intensive care unit for what Ben’s dad reports was “something to do with his heart; it was the wrong shape or something.” Ben has had to meet with a pediatric gastroenterologist since birth for problems related to feeding. Ben’s father reports they met with a geneticist about 2 weeks ago, and they are awaiting the results from that testing. On direct exam by pediatrician, the patient is noted to have rather diffuse hypotonia, excessive drooling, a small head and jaw, and a fixed splitting of the second heart sound.","Let me analyze this clinical case vignette carefully.

Key clinical findings:
1. 12-month-old infant
2. Dysmorphic features:
   - Widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism)
   - Low-set ears
   - Small head (microcephaly)
   - Small jaw (micrognathia)
3. High-pitched cry that sounds like a cat (""cat-like cry"")
4. Low birth weight (4 lbs 5 oz)
5. Spent 1 week in NICU for cardiac issues (""wrong shape"")
6. Feeding problems requiring pediatric gastroenterologist
7. Physical exam findings:
   - Diffuse hypotonia
   - Excessive drooling
   - Microcephaly
   - Micrognathia
   - Fixed splitting of second heart sound (suggests congenital heart defect, possibly ASD)
8. Genetic testing pending
9. Separation anxiety behaviors (cries loudly when left alone)

This presentation is classic for Cri-du-chat syndrome (5p deletion syndrome), characterized by:
- Cat-like cry (pathognomonic)
- Low birth weight
- Microcephaly
- Micrognathia
- Hypotonia
- Cardiac defects
- Feeding difficulties
- Intellectual disability

However, the question asks specifically for DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses with F-codes. Let me think about what psychiatric diagnoses would be appropriate here.

Looking at the DSM-5-TR, the relevant category would be:
- Intellectual Developmental Disorder (Intellectual Disability) - though at 12 months, this may be difficult to formally diagnose, the presentation strongly suggests this will be present
- Global Developmental Delay - this is the appropriate diagnosis when a child is too young to undergo systematic assessment of intellectual functioning (typically under age 5)

The genetic syndrome (Cri-du-chat) itself would be coded differently, but the DSM-5-TR does include specifiers for intellectual disability when associated with known genetic syndromes.


For a 12-month-old with this clinical presentation, Global Developmental Delay (F88) is the most appropriate DSM-5-TR diagnosis since formal intellectual disability assessment requires systematic evaluation that's not feasible at this age. The specific severity level of intellectual disability (F70-F73) would be determined once the child is older and can be properly assessed. The cat-like cry is pathognomonic for Cri-du-chat syndrome, which carries significant implications for developmental outcomes. Given the dysmorphic features, hypotonia, feeding difficulties, and congenital heart defect alongside pending genetic confirmation, intellectual disability is a likely consequence of this chromosomal disorder.

For psychiatric coding, Global Developmental Delay (F88) fits best since the child is under 5 and the full extent of developmental impairment cannot yet be comprehensively assessed. Unspecified Intellectual Disability (F79) could apply as a secondary diagnosis if the genetic testing confirms the suspected syndrome. The presentation doesn't clearly support other neurodevelopmental diagnoses like stereotypic movement disorder, and the infant's crying when separated is developmentally normative rather than indicative of anxiety disorder. d not fit this presentation. The feeding difficulties appear rooted in the anatomical and neurological issues rather than a primary eating disorder. Separation distress at 12 months is developmentally normative—the father's observation about the child crying when left alone briefly aligns with typical attachment behavior at this age, not pathological separation anxiety.

The most fitting diagnoses are Global Developmental Delay (F88) as the primary code given the age and clinical features, and Unspecified Intellectual Developmental Disorder (F79) as an anticipatory diagnosis based on the genetic syndrome indicators. Unspecified Neurodevelopmental Disorder (F89) could also apply depending on how specifically the suspected genetic etiology needs to be documented. Separation Anxiety Disorder (F93.0) could apply if the developmental concerns warrant it, though the presentation seems age-appropriate. Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (F50.82) is relevant given the feeding difficulties noted, though these likely stem from the underlying medical condition rather than psychological factors.

The most accurate diagnostic codes appear to be Global Developmental Delay (F88) as the primary diagnosis, with Unspecified Intellectual Developmental Disorder (F79) and Unspecified Neurodevelopmental Disorder (F89) as secondary considerations. For a 12-month-old presenting with classic features of Cri-du-chat syndrome, the developmental delays and associated complications are the core diagnostic focus. d Neurodevelopmental Disorder - F89
4. Unspecified Communication Disorder - F80.9
5. Unspecified Feeding or Eating Disorder - F50.9 (more appropriate than ARFID given the structural/medical nature of the feeding difficulties rather than psychological avoidance)

The feeding diagnosis needs reconsideration since ARFID requires specific psychological features like sensory-based avoidance or fear of consequences, whereas the presentation here suggests organic feeding challenges related to the syndrome's physical characteristics. The unspecified feeding disorder better captures medically-based feeding difficulties without imposing psychological criteria that aren't clearly present. Considering feeding and eating disorders, options like Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (F50.89) or Unspecified Feeding or Eating Disorder (F50.9) could apply, though they may not fit well given the medical basis of the feeding difficulties. Looking at motor presentation, Developmental Coordination Disorder (F82) seems relevant given the hypotonia. The most defensible diagnoses would be Global Developmental Delay (F88) as primary, followed by Unspecified Intellectual Developmental Disorder (F79), Developmental Coordination Disorder (F82), Unspecified Communication Disorder (F80.9), and Unspecified Neurodevelopmental Disorder (F89). These are somewhat speculative given the physical findings and suspected genetic syndrome, but they represent the most clinically applicable neurodevelopmental codes for this presentation.","1.

94,"Olivia Jacobs, a 22-year-old graduate student in architecture, was referred for an urgent psychiatric consultation after she told her roommate that she was suicidal. Ms. Jacobs had a history of mood symptoms that had been under good control with lithium and sertraline, but her depressive symptoms had returned soon after she had arrived in a new city for school, 3 months earlier. She had become preoccupied with ways in which she might kill herself without inconveniencing others. Her dominant suicidal thoughts involved shooting herself in the head while leaning out the window, so as not to cause a mess in the dorm. Although she did not have access to a gun, she spent time searching the Web for places where she might purchase one.
 
 Ms. Jacobs’s psychiatric history began at age 15, when she began to regularly drink alcohol and smoke marijuana, usually when out at dance clubs with friends. Both of these substances calmed her, and she denied that either had become problematic. She had used neither alcohol nor marijuana since starting graduate school.
 
 Around age 17, she began experiencing brief, intense depressive episodes, marked by tearfulness, feelings of guilt, anhedonia, hopelessness, low energy, and poor concentration. She would sleep more than 12 hours a day and neglect responsibilities at school and home.
 
 These depressive episodes would generally shift after a few weeks into periods of increased energy, pressured speech, and unusual creativity. She would stay up most of the night working on projects and building architectural models. These revved-up episodes lasted about 5 days and were punctuated by feelings that her friends had turned against her and that they were not really friends at all. Worried especially about the paranoia, her family had brought her to a psychiatrist, who diagnosed her as having bipolar II disorder and prescribed lithium and sertraline. Although Ms. Jacobs’s moods did not completely stabilize on this regimen, she did well enough at a local university to be accepted into a prestigious graduate program far from home. At that point the depression returned, and she became intensely suicidal for the first time.
 
 Upon evaluation, the patient was visibly depressed and tearful, and had psychomotor slowing. She said it was very difficult to get out of bed and she was not attending class most days. She reported hopelessness, poor concentration, and guilt about spending family money for school when she was not able to perform. She stated that she thought about suicide most of the time and that she had found nothing to distract her. She denied recent drinking or smoking marijuana, stating she did not feel like “partying.” She acknowledged profound feelings of emptiness and indicated that she had occasionally cut her arms superficially to “see what it would feel like.” She stated that she knew that cutting herself in this way would not kill her. She reported depersonalization and occasional panic attacks. She denied having mood instability, derealization, problems with impulsivity, concerns about her identity, and fears of abandonment.","Let me analyze this clinical case systematically to develop a differential diagnosis.

**Data Extraction and Organization:**

**Demographic Information:**
- 22-year-old female
- Graduate student in architecture
- Recently relocated to a new city for school (3 months ago)

**Presenting Complaint:**
- Suicidal ideation with specific plan (shooting herself in the head while leaning out window)
- Active planning behavior (searching web for gun purchase locations)
- Preoccupation with suicide without inconveniencing others
- No current access to means (gun)

**Current Symptoms:**
- Visibly depressed and tearful
- Psychomotor slowing
- Difficulty getting out of bed
- Not attending class most days
- Hopelessness
- Poor concentration
- Guilt about spending family money when not performing
- Constant suicidal ideation
- Profound feelings of emptiness
- Occasional superficial self-cutting (exploratory, not lethal intent)
- Depersonalization
- Occasional panic attacks

**Denies:**
- Recent alcohol or marijuana use
- Mood instability currently
- Derealization
- Problems with impulsivity
- Concerns about identity
- Fears of abandonment

**Psychiatric History:**
- Age 15: Began using alcohol and marijuana regularly at dance clubs - used for calming effect, denied problematic use, has not used since starting graduate school
- Age 17: Onset of brief, intense depressive episodes with:
  - Tearfulness
  - Feelings of guilt
  - Anhedonia
  - Hopelessness
  - Low energy
  - Poor concentration
  - Hypersomnia (>12 hours/day)
  - Neglecting responsibilities

- These depressive episodes would shift after a few weeks into periods of:
  - Increased energy
  - Pressured speech
  - Unusual creativity
  - Decreased need for sleep (staying up most of the night working)
  - These lasted about 5 days and were punctuated by paranoid feelings about friends

**Treatment History:**
- Previously diagnosed with Bipolar II disorder
- Treated with lithium and sertraline
- Moods did not completely stabilize but functioned well enough to be accepted to prestigious graduate program
- Depression returned 3 months ago after relocating

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

**Primary Consideration - Bipolar II Disorder, Current Episode Depressed:**
- History of hypomanic episodes lasting ~5 days (meets duration criteria for hypomania)
- During these episodes: increased energy, pressured speech, decreased need for sleep, increased creativity, and paranoid ideation. The current depressive presentation aligns with her known bipolar II diagnosis and prior treatment response.

**Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Severe:**
- The elevated periods appear to meet hypomanic criteria based on the constellation of symptoms (decreased sleep need, increased energy, pressured speech, goal-directed activity), though I should consider whether they fall short of full hypomania. The current episode clearly satisfies MDD criteria.

**Borderline Personality Disorder Considerations:**
- She reports emptiness and self-harm through cutting, but denies key BPD features including abandonment fears, identity disturbance, and impulsivity, making this diagnosis less likely.

**Substance Use Considerations:**
- Alcohol and marijuana use began at 15 and continued socially with a calming effect; she's been abstinent for 3 months since graduate school started. While there's insufficient data to diagnose current substance use disorder, the pattern suggests possible past criteria-meeting use.

**Panic Disorder and Depersonalization/Derealization:**
- Occasional panic attacks are reported but lack detail about frequency and avoidance patterns. Depersonalization occurs within the depressive episode context, suggesting it may be secondary rather than a primary disorder.

**Differential Diagnosis:**
- The clinical picture points toward bipolar spectrum illness as most consistent with her presentation.

The longitudinal pattern of hypomanic episodes—characterized by 5 days of elevated mood, increased energy, pressured speech, reduced sleep need, and heightened productivity—alternating with major depressive episodes best explains her course. Her current severe depression with suicidal ideation and prior mood stabilizer treatment support bipolar II disorder as the primary diagnosis. Major depressive disorder remains a consideration if the hypomanic episodes fall short of full criteria, though they appear to meet them. Panic disorder and anxiety disorders are secondary concerns given the limited information about panic frequency and characteristics. Cannabis Use Disorder, Early Remission - she's been abstinent for 3 months after starting use at age 15. Similarly, Alcohol Use Disorder, Early Remission applies given the same timeline and abstinence period. Depersonalization-derealization symptoms are present but likely secondary to the mood disorder rather than a separate diagnosis. The occasional panic attacks could also be mood-related rather than indicative of a distinct panic disorder. Given her denial of problematic substance use patterns and limited evidence, I should avoid over-diagnosing based on insufficient information. The primary diagnosis remains Bipolar II Disorder, Current Episode Depressed, Severe. The depersonalization appears to be a symptom of her depression rather than a standalone condition. Panic attacks are present but lack the specificity needed for a formal panic disorder diagnosis—I'd need clearer information about whether they're unexpected, what avoidance patterns exist, and how frequently they occur.

Ruling out other possibilities: Unspecified Depressive Disorder doesn't fit given her documented bipolar II history. Adjustment Disorder is too narrow for someone with an established mood disorder. Borderline Personality Disorder doesn't align with her presentation—she denies core features like abandonment anxiety, identity disturbance, and impulsivity, and her self-harm was exploratory rather than chronic.

The primary diagnosis remains Bipolar II Disorder, Current Episode Depressed, Severe, with Unspecified Anxiety Disorder as a secondary diagnosis capturing the panic and anxiety symptoms that don't meet criteria for a more specific anxiety condition.

Regarding substance use: she used cannabis and alcohol regularly starting at fifteen, both with a calming effect suggesting self-medication, and has been abstinent for three months. However, I'm hesitant to diagnose substance use disorders without evidence of actual impairment or problematic consequences—regular use at social venues doesn't necessarily constitute a disorder.

For the secondary diagnoses, Panic Disorder seems warranted given her reported panic attacks, even if infrequent. The depersonalization-derealization symptoms likely stem from her mood disturbance rather than representing a separate primary disorder. A more conservative approach would focus on the mood disorder and anxiety without overreaching on the substance use diagnoses. The self-harm appears exploratory rather than a pattern of deliberate self-injury, and she denies key borderline features like abandonment anxiety and identity disturbance, so borderline personality disorder doesn't fit. Paranoid ideation during hypomanic states can emerge within mood episodes themselves without requiring a separate psychotic diagnosis.

For the substance use diagnoses, I'm reconsidering whether to include them at all—she denies problematic use and shows no clear functional impairment from cannabis or alcohol. The paranoid features during mood episodes are better explained as part of the bipolar presentation rather than indicating a distinct psychotic disorder.

Looking at panic disorder more carefully, the occasional panic attacks may not actually meet threshold if they're infrequent and don't trigger the persistent worry or behavioral changes that define the disorder. I need to be precise about whether the panic symptoms are truly recurrent and clinically significant enough to warrant that diagnosis. Use Disorder, Mild, In Early Remission - F12.11

5. Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder - F48.1 (though this is secondary to the depressive episode)

I'm weighing whether the panic attacks meet criteria for Panic Disorder or if Unspecified Anxiety Disorder is more appropriate given limited information. The substance use disorders appear mild and in early remission based on her current abstinence. For the fifth diagnosis, depersonalization seems less likely as a primary condition since it's emerging within the context of her severe depression, but it could still be documented if clinically significant. I'll finalize the diagnoses with these codes. For the substance use disorders, I'm coding both as mild with early remission status: Alcohol Use Disorder at F10.11 and Cannabis Use Disorder at F12.11. I should verify the Bipolar II coding—F31.81 captures the disorder, though I need to confirm how severity is specified in ICD-10 for the depressed episode.

My final diagnostic list includes Bipolar II Disorder (F31.81), Panic Disorder (F41.0), both substance use disorders in early remission (F10.11 and F12.11), and Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder (F48.1). These codes align with the clinical presentation and documented history. The severity of the depressive episode with active suicidal ideation and planning is already captured in the Bipolar II diagnosis, so I don't need a separate specifier. For the fifth diagnosis, depersonalization-derealization disorder fits better than alternatives like unspecified anxiety disorder, since she specifically reports these symptoms and they may need independent clinical attention despite being secondary to the mood disturbance.

My final diagnoses are: Bipolar II Disorder, Current Episode Depressed, Severe (F31.81); Panic Disorder (F41.0); Alcohol Use Disorder, Mild, In Early Remission (F10.11); Cannabis Use Disorder, Mild, In Early Remission (F12.11); and Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder (F48.1).","1.

1032,"Patient is a 10-year-old female who is brought into the walk-in area of a psychiatric hospital for hitting kids at school. The patient is a ward of the state, both of her parents were found to be unfit to care for the child. The guardian received a report from her teacher that the patient slapped a classmate during an argument. The patient is in the 5th grade. She has had many other reports this year for throwing tantrums and getting into fights. Guardian reports that patient has a history of being returned from various foster and adoptive families due to anger and aggression. She states that since the patient has been under her care, she has noticed the patient to be easily irritable with little to no accountability for her own actions, blaming the other kids for annoying her or saying that “I didn’t mean it.” Aggressive outbursts occur multiple times a week. When asked, the patient says that other kids annoy her but is unable to specify examples. She also says that staff and teachers annoy her too. However, she denies hitting them. The patient during the assessment repeated interrupts the guardian and the evaluator saying, “I didn’t do anything,” and begging to be taken home. As guardian shares reports made by the school, the patient interrupts and calls guardian a “liar” and is visibly upset. Patient begs the evaluator to let her go home and not recommend hospitalization. However, when evaluator informed patient that aggression is often a reason for admission, patient suddenly becomes very angry, picking up a tissues box and throwing it at the glass divider between her and the evaluator. When evaluator pointed out her behavior, patient immediately becomes tearful and apologetic, stating,” I didn’t do anything, I didn’t mean it, I didn’t even hit you.” Guardian states that behaviors like this is what she is referring to. Guardian reports that her outbursts are most common when she doesn’t get her way, but that she seems to be irritable in general as well.","Let me carefully analyze this clinical case vignette to extract relevant information and develop a differential diagnosis.

**Data Extraction and Organization:**

Demographics:
- 10-year-old female
- Ward of the state (both parents found unfit)
- 5th grade student
- History of multiple foster/adoptive placement failures

Presenting Problem:
- Brought to psychiatric walk-in for hitting kids at school
- Slapped a classmate during an argument

Behavioral History:
- Multiple reports this year for throwing tantrums and getting into fights
- History of being returned from various foster and adoptive families due to anger and aggression
- Aggressive outbursts occur multiple times a week
- Pattern of behavior across multiple settings (school, foster homes, current guardian's home)

Mental Status/Behavioral Observations During Assessment:
- Easily irritable
- Little to no accountability for actions
- Blames others (""other kids annoy her,"" ""staff and teachers annoy her too"")
- Repeatedly interrupts guardian and evaluator
- Called guardian a ""liar"" and was visibly upset
- Became very angry when told aggression could lead to admission
- Threw a tissue box at the glass divider
- Immediately became tearful and apologetic after outburst
- Denial of actions (""I didn't do anything,"" ""I didn't mean it,"" ""I didn't even hit you"")

Pattern of Behavior:
- Outbursts most common when she doesn't get her way
- Generally irritable
- Denies hitting teachers/staff but admits hitting peers
- Unable to specify examples of how others annoy her

Psychosocial/Risk Factors:
- Removal from biological parents (trauma history likely)
- Multiple placement disruptions
- Unstable early environment
- Ward of the state

**Differential Diagnosis:**

1. **Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) - F34.81**
- Severe recurrent temper outbursts (verbal and behavioral/physical aggression)


- Reactions are disproportionate to the triggering event and developmentally inappropriate for a 10-year-old
- Frequency criterion met with outbursts occurring multiple times weekly
- Baseline mood remains irritable even between episodes, as noted by her guardian
- Symptoms manifest across different environments including school and home settings
- Chronicity appears established given her history of multiple placement failures attributed to anger and aggression problems
- Age of onset criterion satisfied (symptoms present before age 10, currently age 10)

2. **Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) - F91.3**
- Angry/irritable mood pattern evident throughout assessment and reported history
- Defiant behavior demonstrated by arguing, refusing to accept responsibility, and blaming others for her actions
- Vindictiveness potentially present given her immediate emotional reactions and denial patterns
- Symptoms present across multiple settings (school, home, foster placements)
- Duration appears to meet criteria given the chronic nature of placement disruptions

3. **Conduct Disorder (CD) - Childhood-onset type - F91.1**
- Physical aggression documented (hitting, slapping behaviors)
- Limited evidence of other conduct disorder features like property destruction (tissue box incident appears minor in scope) or rule violations
- No clear indicators of theft, deceitfulness, fire-setting, or other serious behavioral violations
- Aggression appears reactive rather than calculated or predatory

4. **Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD) - F94.1** or **Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder (DSED) - F94.2**
- Early neglect and removal from biological parents, followed by multiple placement changes, align with risk factors for attachment disorders
- However, the clinical presentation doesn't clearly match RAD's withdrawn, emotionally restricted pattern or DSED's indiscriminate friendliness with strangers
- The behavioral dysregulation seems more primary than attachment dysfunction, though early relational trauma likely contributes

5. **Unspecified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder - F43.9**
- Documented history of significant stressors including parental removal and placement instability suggests trauma exposure
- Behavioral symptoms could stem from trauma responses, though insufficient detail for PTSD diagnosis

6. **Adjustment Disorder with Disturbance of Conduct - F43.24**
- Possible if symptoms emerged following a specific stressor
- The long-standing pattern across multiple placements points toward a more entrenched condition rather than adjustment-related

7. **Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) - F63.81**
- Recurrent outbursts with loss of control over aggressive impulses, disproportionate to triggers
- Diagnosis requires ruling out ODD, CD, or DMDD as better explanations
- Age and chronicity suggest another disorder better accounts for the presentation

**Diagnostic Considerations:**

The primary question centers on distinguishing between DMDD and ODD, with conduct disorder also warranting consideration

. DMDD requires both severe temper outbursts and a persistently irritable mood between episodes, whereas ODD emphasizes defiant and argumentative behavior without necessarily including severe outbursts. This patient demonstrates both the explosive episodes and the underlying irritability characteristic of DMDD, though the prominent defiance and argumentativeness are hallmark ODD features. Per DSM-5-TR, DMDD takes precedence when both sets of criteria are met, though Conduct Disorder can coexist with DMDD if warranted.

**Primary Diagnosis: Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) - F34.81**
This diagnosis best accounts for the combination of severe, recurrent temper outbursts alongside persistent irritable mood.

The secondary considerations include Conduct Disorder if the physical aggression toward peers represents a broader pattern of conduct problems, and Oppositional Defiant Disorder as an alternative if DMDD criteria aren't fully satisfied. However, given the clear evidence of severe outbursts and chronic irritability across multiple settings, DMDD appears to be the most appropriate primary diagnosis.

Trauma exposure from parental removal and placement instability likely contributes significantly to the presentation, warranting consideration of an unspecified trauma-related disorder. Attachment disorders—both the inhibited and disinhibited presentations—are less clearly supported by the available information. ADHD should also be evaluated given the impulsivity demonstrated (throwing objects, interrupting), though this would need to be distinguished from the impulsive aggression characteristic of DMDD.

The final diagnostic formulation prioritizes DMDD as the primary diagnosis given the severe mood dysregulation and irritability, with conduct disorder as a comorbid condition since the two can co-occur. The rapid emotional shifts from anger to remorse, combined with the trauma history and attachment concerns, support including both an unspecified trauma-related disorder and reactive attachment disorder. ADHD rounds out the five diagnoses, though the impulsivity may be better explained by the mood dysregulation itself rather than representing a separate attentional disorder. - F90.9** for the impulsivity and tendency to act without considering consequences. Though reconsidering the differential, ODD should be included as an alternative if DMDD criteria aren't fully satisfied, since they're mutually exclusive diagnoses. The core distinction hinges on whether the severe mood dysregulation and outburst pattern truly meets DMDD thresholds or if oppositional defiance is the primary feature instead.","1.

1003,"Neveah is a 14 year old girl that comes to her pediatrician with her mother (presently 4 months pregnant) due to “out of control behaviors at home.” The patient appears restless in the exam room and requiring redirection from her mother throughout the visit. The patient frequently punches her mother in the legs, and in the stomach, and the patient even threw her ipad at the pediatrician when she asked the patient what was upsetting her. Most of the patients psychiatric history is gathered from her mother, given how irritable the patient is during the exam. The mother reports Neveah was born 8 weeks pre-mature, spent about 1 month in the neonatal intensive care unit due to problems with breathing, and ultimately discharged home to her care at one month of age. The patient met developmental milestones on or near expected time, and was “clingy” when she was a toddler, but had no problems making friends in daycare and grade school. When patient was about 11 years of age, her biological father left the home to join the military, and has deployed ever since. Around 12 years of age, around summertime, the patient appeared much more talkative, energetic, and would go several days only needing about 3 hours of sleep at night. She was more impulsive during these times, and believed she had super powers to “make her friends get in trouble at school”, even when she was not at school herself. She was never tired the following day. During that same period, she had many temper tantrums throughout the day, almost every day of the week, that seemed disproportionate to circumstances, like having to have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich instead of a peanut butter and fluff sandwich. The tantrums would last several hours in a day. This pattern of behavior would last for several weeks at a time, with periods of months returning to normal mood and behavior. The patient never appeared to be hallucination or responding to internal stimuli, and never appeared sad or depressed. Neveah had to be hospitalized during an episode like this when she was 13 years old. Neveah refuses to take medications for her symptoms. The start of this year academic year, that patient appeared more calm and in good behavioral control, but began to have similar symptoms of irritability, violence at home, not needing to sleep, talking fast, and property destruction at home.","Let me carefully analyze this clinical case vignette to develop an accurate differential diagnosis.

**Data Extraction and Organization:**

Demographics:
- 14-year-old female
- Mother is 4 months pregnant (potential stressor)

Presenting Complaint:
- ""Out of control behaviors at home""

Current Mental Status Observations:
- Restless in exam room
- Requires redirection from mother
- Physically aggressive (punching mother in legs and stomach)
- Threw iPad at pediatrician
- Very irritable

Birth/Developmental History:
- Born 8 weeks premature
- 1 month in NICU due to breathing problems
- Met developmental milestones on or near expected time
- ""Clingy"" as a toddler but had no problems making friends

Family/Social History:
- Biological father left home when patient was ~11 years old to join military
- Father has been deployed since
- Mother currently pregnant

Psychiatric History:
- Onset around age 12 (summertime)
- Episode characteristics:
  * Much more talkative
  * Energetic
  * Decreased need for sleep (only ~3 hours/night for several days)
  * More impulsive
  * Grandiose beliefs - believed she had ""super powers to make her friends get in trouble at school"" even when she wasn't at school (this is delusional/psychotic-level grandiosity)
  * NOT tired the following day (true decreased need for sleep)
  * Many temper tantrums throughout the day, almost every day
  * Disproportionate to circumstances
  * Tantrums lasting several hours in a day

Episode Pattern:
- Episodes last several weeks at a time
- Periods of months returning to normal mood and behavior
- No hallucinations or responding to internal stimuli
- Never appeared sad or depressed
- Required hospitalization at age 13 during an episode

Current Episode (start of academic year):
- Period of being calm and good behavioral control


- Symptoms have now resurfaced with irritability, aggression, insomnia, rapid speech, and destructive behavior

Treatment:
- Refuses to take medications

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

1. **Bipolar I Disorder, Current Episode Manic** - This is the most likely diagnosis
   - Distinct periods of abnormally elevated/irritable mood lasting weeks
   - Decreased need for sleep (3 hours and not tired)
   - Pressured speech/more talkative
   - Grandiose delusions (believing she has super powers)
   - Increased goal-directed activity and impulsivity

, with clear episodic pattern showing weeks of symptoms followed by months of normal functioning. The severity warrants hospitalization, and psychotic features (grandiose delusions) confirm Bipolar I with psychotic features.

2. **Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD)** - Less likely given the clinical picture
   - While severe temper outbursts and daily irritability are present, the episodic nature with return to baseline, markedly reduced sleep need, and grandiose thinking strongly favor Bipolar I instead. DMDD cannot coexist with documented manic episodes and lacks the distinct mood elevation and psychotic features seen here.

3. **Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD)** - Possible comorbidity
   - Irritability and defiant behavior are evident, but these appear to be manifestations of the underlying mood episodes rather than a separate disorder.

4. **ADHD** - Unlikely as primary diagnosis
   - Restlessness and impulsivity are present, though they seem directly tied to the episodic mood disturbances rather than representing independent attention-deficit symptoms.

5. **Conduct Disorder** - Present in context of mood episodes
   - Aggression and property destruction occur, but within the framework of the manic episodes rather than as a standalone pattern.

6. **Intermittent Explosive Disorder** - Does not fit the presentation
   - While recurrent outbursts occur, the clear episodic structure with distinct manic features and psychotic symptoms points away from this diagnosis.

The episodic pattern is the critical distinguishing feature—weeks of intense symptoms followed by months of normal functioning. The decreased need for sleep without fatigue, combined with grandiose delusions about possessing super powers, strongly indicates psychotic mania. The hospitalization at age 13 reflects the severity of these episodes. Without documented depressive episodes, this presents as Bipolar I Disorder in a current manic episode with psychotic features, coded F31.2.

Other conditions warrant consideration in the differential: Conduct Disorder could explain the aggression and property destruction, ADHD might account for the impulsivity and restlessness, and Oppositional Defiant Disorder could underlie the defiant behavior and irritability. However, the episodic nature and specific features of decreased need for sleep with grandiose delusions make Bipolar I the primary diagnosis. Importantly, DMDD and Bipolar Disorder cannot coexist diagnostically per DSM-5 criteria, so if Bipolar I is confirmed, DMDD is excluded.

For coding purposes, F31.2 applies if psychotic features are present in the current manic episode. However, reviewing the timeline more carefully—while grandiose beliefs about possessing superpowers emerged at age 12, it's unclear whether these delusions persist in the current presentation. The acute episode is characterized by irritability, violence, markedly decreased sleep need, pressured speech, and destructive behavior, but psychotic symptoms aren't explicitly documented in this current phase. This distinction affects whether F31.2 or F31.1 is most appropriate. However, given the previous episode included psychotic features and the current episode sounds similar in severity, it would be reasonable to specify with psychotic features.

Let me finalize my diagnoses:

1. Bipolar I Disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features - F31.2
2. Conduct Disorder, adolescent-onset type - F91.2 (for the aggression toward mother, property destruction - though this may be accounted for by the manic episode)
3. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, unspecified - F90.9 (impulsivity, restlessness - though again may be accounted for by mania)
4. Parent-child relational problem - but this doesn't have an F code
5. Oppositional Defiant Disorder - F91.3

Actually, I need to be careful. The aggressive behaviors and irritability are occurring in the context of manic episodes, so they may not warrant separate diagnoses. The DSM-5 is clear that symptoms occurring exclusively during mood episodes shouldn't result in separate diagnoses. Still, I should list five diagnoses as requested. The primary diagnosis is clearly Bipolar I Disorder with the current manic episode featuring psychotic elements. Beyond that, I can note Conduct Disorder given the physical aggression and property destruction, and Oppositional Defiant Disorder, though these may be secondary manifestations of the mood disorder itself. Disorder, combined presentation - F90.2
4. Oppositional Defiant Disorder - F91.3

The episodic pattern with complete return to baseline strongly supports Bipolar I Disorder as the primary diagnosis. DMDD is excluded because it cannot coexist with a history of manic episodes per DSM-5 criteria. The remaining diagnoses represent behavioral and attentional symptoms that may occur during manic episodes or warrant separate consideration depending on baseline functioning. Looking at the diagnostic criteria more carefully, if Bipolar I doesn't fully meet threshold, Unspecified Bipolar and Related Disorder or Other Specified Bipolar and Related Disorder could serve as alternatives. Conduct Disorder with adolescent-onset presentation fits the aggression and property destruction pattern, though these behaviors are occurring within the context of mood episodes. ADHD should also be assessed given the hyperactivity and impulsivity, though this would require evaluation of baseline functioning separate from the acute episode. Brief Psychotic Disorder is less likely given the presence of a full mood syndrome rather than isolated psychotic features.

The adjustment disorder framework doesn't adequately capture this presentation since the symptom severity exceeds what would be expected as a reaction to stressors like the father leaving or mother's pregnancy. The manic episode with possible psychotic features appears to be the primary driver. If there's uncertainty about whether psychotic features are present in the current episode, Bipolar I with moderate mania could be considered instead of the severe with psychotic features specifier. Oppositional Defiant Disorder should also be evaluated alongside Conduct Disorder, and combined-type ADHD remains relevant for the hyperactivity and impulsivity components.

Narrowing to five distinct diagnoses that could genuinely apply: Bipolar I Disorder with current manic episode and psychotic features, Conduct Disorder of adolescent-onset, combined-presentation ADHD, Intermittent Explosive Disorder for the aggression and rage episodes, and Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder as a differential consideration. Though DMDD and Bipolar I are mutually exclusive diagnoses, and IED wouldn't typically be diagnosed if the mood disorder better explains the symptoms, these represent the key diagnostic possibilities being weighed. .2

The differential diagnosis should account for other conditions that present with behavioral dysregulation in adolescents. Conduct Disorder with adolescent-onset, ADHD combined presentation, and Oppositional Defiant Disorder are relevant considerations given the aggression and rule-breaking behavior. Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder also warrants consideration, though it would be excluded if the full manic syndrome criteria are satisfied. ODD symptoms occurring exclusively during mood episodes wouldn't typically warrant a separate diagnosis.","1. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic severe with psychotic features - F31.2

80,"Ashley, age 17, was referred for a diagnostic reevaluation after having carried diagnoses of autism and intellectual disability for almost all of her life. She was recently found to have Kleefstra syndrome, and the family wanted to reconfirm the earlier diagnoses and assess the genetic risk to the future children of her older sisters.
 
 At the time of the reevaluation, Ashley was attending a special school with a focus on functional skills. She was able to dress herself, but she was not able to shower independently or be left alone in the house. She was able to decode (e.g., read words) and spell at a second-grade level but understood little of what she read. Changes to her schedule and heightened functional expectations tended to make her irritable. When upset, Ashley would often hurt herself (e.g., biting her wrist) and others (e.g., pinching and hair pulling).
 
 In formal testing done at the time of the reevaluation, Ashley had a nonverbal IQ of 39 and a verbal IQ of 23, with a full scale IQ of 31. Her adaptive scores were somewhat higher, with an overall score of 42 (with 100 as average).
 
 By history, Ashley first received services at age 9 months after her parents noticed significant motor delays. She walked at 20 months and was toilet trained at 5 years. She spoke her first word at age 6. She received a diagnosis of developmental delay at age 3 and of autism, obesity, and static encephalopathy at age 4. An early evaluation noted possible facial dysmorphology; genetic tests at that time were noncontributory.
 
 Her parents indicated that Ashley knew hundreds of single words and many simple phrases. She had long been very interested in license plates and would draw them for hours. Her strongest skill was memory, and she could draw precise representations of license plates from different states. Ashley had always been very attached to her parents and sisters, and although affectionate toward babies, she showed minimal interest in other teenagers.
 
 Ashley’s family history was pertinent for a father with dyslexia, a paternal uncle with epilepsy, and a maternal male cousin with possible “Asperger’s syndrome.” Her siblings, both sisters, were in college and doing well.
 
 On examination, Ashley was an overweight young woman who made inconsistent eye contact but often peered out the corner of her eye. She had a beautiful smile and would sometimes laugh to herself, but most of the time her facial expressions were subdued. She did not initiate joint attention by trying to catch another person’s eyes. She frequently ignored what others would say to her. To request a preferred object (e.g., a shiny magazine), Ashley would rock from foot to foot and point. When offered an object (e.g., a small decorated box), she brought it to her nose and lips for inspection. Ashley spoke in a high-pitched voice with unusual intonation. During the interview, she used multiple words and a few short phrases that were somewhat rote but communicative, such as “I want to clean up,” and “Do you have a van?”
 
 In the months prior to the evaluation, Ashley’s parents noticed that she had become increasingly apathetic. A medical evaluation concluded that urinary tract infections were the most likely cause for her symptoms, but antibiotics seemed only to make her more listless. Further medical evaluation led to more extensive genetic testing, and Ashley was diagnosed with Kleefstra syndrome, a rare genetic defect associated with multiple medical problems, including intellectual developmental disorder. The parents said they were also tested and found to “be negative.”
 
 The parents specifically wanted to know whether the genetic testing results affected Ashley’s long-standing diagnoses and access to future services. Furthermore, they wanted to know whether their other two daughters should get tested for their risk of carrying genes for autism, intellectual disability, and/or Kleefstra syndrome.","Let me carefully analyze this clinical case vignette to extract and organize relevant information and develop a differential diagnosis.

- Engages in unusual sensory exploration, bringing objects to nose and lips
- Occasional self-directed laughter

**Recent Clinical Changes and Medical History:**
- Growing apathy over recent months; initial UTI suspicion didn't explain worsening listlessness despite antibiotic treatment

- Obesity and static encephalopathy documented

**Family Context:**
- Father has dyslexia; paternal uncle with epilepsy; maternal male cousin with possible autism spectrum features

- Static encephalopathy

The diagnostic picture centers on severe intellectual disability with a Full Scale IQ of 31, placing her in the severe range and corresponding with significant adaptive deficits—she requires assistance with self-care, cannot be left unsupervised, and functions academically at a second-grade level. Autism spectrum disorder is also clearly present, evidenced by marked social communication difficulties including inconsistent eye contact, absent joint attention initiation, minimal verbal output limited to words and phrases, atypical nonverbal behaviors like pointing accompanied by rocking, and frequent disregard of others' attempts at interaction.

Her restricted interests manifest as a preoccupation with license plates that consumes hours of her time through drawing, alongside unusual sensory-seeking behaviors and notable distress when routines change. Language development was significantly delayed with her first word emerging at age 6, and her current expressive abilities remain severely limited. The ASD diagnosis stands independently despite the identified genetic etiology of Kleefstra syndrome, which serves as an associated medical condition rather than replacing the autism diagnosis. She meets criteria for Level 3 support across all domains—social communication, restricted behaviors, and language.

Self-injurious behaviors including wrist biting and aggressive actions toward others (pinching, hair pulling) when distressed appear intrinsic to her autism and intellectual disability presentation rather than warranting separate coding. A concerning recent shift toward increased apathy has emerged, potentially linked to a urinary tract infection that paradoxically worsened her lethargy despite treatment, though distinguishing between depression, medical complications from Kleefstra syndrome, or medication effects requires further assessment.

The primary diagnosis is Autism Spectrum Disorder with very substantial support needs, intellectual impairment, and language impairment, associated with Kleefstra syndrome. Her severe intellectual disability (IQ 31) significantly impacts adaptive functioning and requires its own designation. The marked gap between verbal and nonverbal abilities suggests a distinct language disorder component warranting separate documentation beyond the autism specifier.

Additional considerations include the recent apathy and withdrawal that persisted despite treatment of her urinary tract infection, which could indicate an underlying depressive process, though this must be distinguished from manifestations of her genetic syndrome. Her self-injurious behavior—specifically wrist biting—occurs frequently enough to potentially warrant coding as Stereotypic Movement Disorder, though this commonly emerges alongside autism and intellectual disability.

For psychiatric diagnoses specifically, the core presentations are her autism spectrum disorder requiring very substantial support and her severe intellectual disability. The genetic syndrome itself falls outside psychiatric classification but contextualizes her overall clinical picture. The stereotypic movement disorder diagnosis is problematic given that Kleefstra syndrome is a neurological condition that could directly cause these behaviors, which would exclude the diagnosis. The self-injury seems more tied to dysregulation when upset rather than true stereotypy. I'm considering alternatives like Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, though the presentation doesn't clearly fit the onset and persistence criteria, or coding this under an unspecified neurodevelopmental disorder instead. Given the overall clinical presentation, my primary diagnoses would be Autism Spectrum Disorder with very substantial support needs and co-occurring intellectual and language impairment, Severe Intellectual Disability, Language Disorder, and Unspecified Depressive Disorder. The self-injurious behavior might be better captured within the autism diagnosis or as a feature of dysregulation rather than as a separate stereotypic movement disorder. I need to reconsider whether language disorder should be coded separately or noted as a specifier within the autism diagnosis, since DSM-5-TR typically incorporates language impairment as a specifier rather than a separate diagnosis when it occurs alongside ASD.

The self-injurious behavior warrants reconsideration—it appears triggered by specific stressors like schedule changes rather than representing the purposeless, driven repetitive movements characteristic of stereotypic movement disorder. This pattern aligns more closely with behavioral dysregulation stemming from her autism and intellectual disability. Intermittent Explosive Disorder seems less fitting given her age and the clear connection between her aggression and difficulty tolerating change.

The final diagnostic picture includes Autism Spectrum Disorder requiring very substantial support, Severe Intellectual Disability, Language Disorder, and Unspecified Depressive Disorder to capture her mood symptoms. it can be coded as a separate condition. I'm also considering Unspecified Neurodevelopmental Disorder (F89) to capture features not fully addressed elsewhere. My working differential includes Autism Spectrum Disorder as the primary diagnosis with appropriate specifiers, Severe Intellectual Disability based on the IQ and adaptive functioning profile, Language Disorder given the significant delays beyond what intellectual disability alone would explain, Unspecified Depressive Disorder for the recent apathy, and Stereotypic Movement Disorder with self-injurious behavior to account for the self-injury pattern, though I recognize this is contextually tied to behavioral dysregulation. I'm reconsidering whether to diagnose language disorder separately—DSM-5-TR typically uses the ""with accompanying language impairment"" specifier when ASD is present, which could make a separate diagnosis redundant. However, the verbal IQ of 23 versus nonverbal IQ of 39 suggests language impairment exceeding what would be expected from intellectual disability alone, which supports listing it separately. Motor delays were documented historically, but she's past the age for Global Developmental Delay coding, and there's insufficient information about current motor function to diagnose Developmental Coordination Disorder. My final diagnostic list narrows to Autism Spectrum Disorder, Severe Intellectual Disability, and Language Disorder.

For the remaining diagnoses, I need to consider whether Unspecified Depressive Disorder applies and how to code the self-injurious behavior. The wrist-biting occurs when she's upset—during schedule changes or when demands increase—which appears to be a distress response rather than the rhythmic, purposeless repetition characteristic of Stereotypic Movement Disorder. DSM-5-TR defines stereotypic movement as driven and apparently purposeless, whereas her behavior seems functionally tied to frustration. This challenging behavior is better understood as associated with her ASD and intellectual disability rather than as a separate stereotypic movement diagnosis.

Since there's no standalone DSM-5-TR code for self-injurious behavior, I could use Other Specified Neurodevelopmental Disorder to capture behaviors related to Kleefstra syndrome not explained elsewhere, or keep Stereotypic Movement Disorder as the closest available fit. The core diagnoses remain ASD, severe intellectual disability, and language disorder, with recent depressive symptoms and behavioral concerns as additional clinical features to monitor. the diagnostic criteria for depressive disorder more carefully. Apathy alone isn't enough—I need evidence of depressed mood, sleep or appetite changes, concentration problems, or suicidal thoughts. The vignette doesn't clearly establish these. While the increased apathy after antibiotics is concerning and could reflect a mood disturbance, it might also stem from the underlying genetic condition or medication effects. Given this ambiguity, I'll include Unspecified Mood Disorder (F39) to flag the concern without overstating the evidence.

My final diagnoses are Autism Spectrum Disorder, Severe Intellectual Disability, Language Disorder, and Stereotypic Movement Disorder with self-injurious behavior, along with Unspecified Mood Disorder to account for the emerging apathy.

I should verify whether Language Disorder warrants a separate code when ASD is present. The DSM-5-TR allows co-diagnosis when language impairment exceeds what's expected given the intellectual level. Ashley's verbal IQ of 23 versus nonverbal IQ of 39, combined with her severe language delays, suggests the language impairment is disproportionate and justifies a distinct Language Disorder diagnosis.

Stepping back at the full clinical picture: ASD and Severe Intellectual Disability are clearly established. Language Disorder, Stereotypic Movement Disorder with self-injury, and Unspecified Depressive Disorder are all probable but carry some uncertainty—the mood symptoms could reflect medical factors rather than a primary mood disorder. This diagnostic formulation feels appropriate. I should also consider whether Anxiety Disorder might be relevant to include.

The schedule changes and heightened expectations do create distress, but in the context of ASD, this irritability typically stems from the core autism feature of insistence on sameness and inflexible routines rather than representing a separate anxiety condition. I don't think an additional anxiety diagnosis is necessary here.","1.

109,"George Anderson, a 73-year-old married man, was referred to a psychiatrist for an evaluation of depression after screening positive on the Geriatric Depression Scale during a neurology appointment. For most of the 2 years since his diagnosis with Parkinson’s disease, Mr. Anderson had coped well and continued to engage in many of his usual activities. His wife of 49 years noted that 1–2 years before developing Parkinson’s disease, Mr. Anderson had become somewhat less enthusiastic and motivated compared with his baseline personality, but not to the point of causing any concern or impairment. The only other neuropsychiatric symptom preceding his Parkinson’s diagnosis was his wife’s report that during the past 5 years he frequently “thrashed about” while asleep.
 
 Three months prior to the referral, however, Mr. Anderson began to decline social invitations from family and friends. He reported that he had withdrawn socially because he had lost pleasure in things that used to excite him, although he denied persistent feelings of sadness or worry. He recognized that he was not his “usual self” and tried, to no avail, to give himself “pep talks.” He had worked as a high school science teacher until retirement at age 67, and reported having learned “the power of seeing the glass half full” from his students. He felt frustrated that he could not “snap out of it” for the first time in his life but was hopeful about getting professional help. He denied wishing for death, explaining that although he was not afraid of death, he wanted to enjoy life as long as possible. He added, “God does not give me more than I can handle. I can’t ask for a better family, and I have had a full life.”
 
 Other new symptoms over the prior few months included increasing fatigue, impaired concentration and memory, unintentional weight loss, and sleep-onset insomnia. Further history on his more chronic sleep symptoms revealed that, around 3:00 a.m. or 4:00 a.m. on most nights, Mr. Anderson began violently moving his extremities and moaning as though in distress, all while still seemingly asleep in bed. He often awakened his wife with these movements and occasionally struck her in his sleep. She sometimes used a different bedroom because of this. When he awoke from such an incident, he was coherent and briefly anxious, often reporting that he had been dreaming of swimming or running from something.
 
 His wife took over driving shortly after his Parkinson’s disease diagnosis, but Mr. Anderson was otherwise independent in activities of daily living such as paying bills and managing his medications. His wife described him as “maybe a little more forgetful” over the past few years, but neither of them was concerned about this mild memory loss.
 
 Past medical history included prostate cancer (in remission), glaucoma, and gout. Labs from his recent neurology visit were unremarkable, including blood counts, serum chemistries, thyroid function, and vitamin B12 levels. Family psychiatric history was positive only for a granddaughter with ADHD. He denied past problematic substance use and all current substance use except two or three glasses of wine monthly. He denied any previous depressive episodes, psychiatric treatment, or psychiatric evaluations.
 
 On mental status examination, Mr. Anderson was pleasant, cooperative, and interpersonally engaging. Resting tremor, shuffling gait, hypophonia, and bradykinesia all were evident at mild to moderate levels. He occasionally smiled, but his affect was difficult to fully gauge because of masked facies. He reported his mood as “blah.” There was no evidence of psychosis.
 
 On cognitive testing, he had some difficulty on the Trail Making Test part B, figure copying, and word-list recall, the latter being helped by category prompts. On a standardized brief cognitive assessment, he scored 25 out of 30 points, which was in the normal range.","Let me carefully analyze this clinical case vignette to extract key information and develop a differential diagnosis.

**Data Extraction and Organization:**

Demographics:
- 73-year-old married man
- Retired high school science teacher (age 67)
- Married 49 years

Medical History:
- Parkinson's disease (diagnosed 2 years ago)
- Prostate cancer (in remission)
- Glaucoma
- Gout
- Recent labs unremarkable (CBC, chemistries, TFTs, B12)

Psychiatric History:
- No prior psychiatric episodes, treatment, or evaluations
- Family history: granddaughter with ADHD only
- Minimal alcohol use (2-3 glasses wine monthly), no substance abuse

Timeline of Symptoms:
1. ~5 years ago: Wife reports he ""thrashed about"" while asleep (REM sleep behavior disorder symptoms)
2. 3-4 years ago (1-2 years before PD diagnosis): Wife noted somewhat less enthusiasm and motivation - prodromal symptoms
3. 2 years ago: Parkinson's disease diagnosed
4. 3 months ago: Onset of current depressive symptoms

Current Symptoms (past 3 months):
- Social withdrawal (declining invitations)
- Anhedonia (lost pleasure in things that used to excite him)
- Denies persistent sadness or worry
- Fatigue
- Impaired concentration and memory
- Unintentional weight loss
- Sleep-onset insomnia
- No suicidal ideation (explicitly denies wishing for death)
- Mood described as ""blah""

Sleep symptoms (chronic, ~5 years):
- Violent movements during sleep at 3-4 AM
- Moaning as though in distress while asleep
- Dream enactment (swimming, running from something)
- Coherent upon awakening, briefly anxious
- Wife occasionally struck during episodes
- Classic REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD)


- Cognitive performance shows some deficits on executive function tasks (Trail Making Test B, figure copying, word-list recall improves with cueing) but overall cognitive screening remains intact at 25/30. He's maintained independence with daily activities aside from driving, which his wife took over post-PD diagnosis, though he reports being ""a little more forgetful"" lately. On examination, he presents as pleasant and cooperative with typical parkinsonian features including resting tremor, shuffling gait, hypophonia, and mild-to-moderate bradykinesia, though his affect appears somewhat restricted and difficult to fully assess.

The clinical picture points toward depression secondary to his Parkinson's disease. Multiple depressive symptoms are evident: anhedonia, social withdrawal, fatigue, cognitive difficulties, weight loss, and insomnia—all present for more than two weeks with clear functional decline. This aligns with the high prevalence of depression in PD populations (40-50%), which stems from the underlying neurodegeneration affecting dopamine and serotonin systems. The appropriate diagnosis would be Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition, reflecting that the depression is a direct consequence of the Parkinson's pathology rather than a primary mood disorder.

Regarding the REM sleep behavior disorder, the five-year history of dream enactment with violent movements, vocalizations, and dream recall upon waking is textbook for this condition. The timing in the latter sleep cycles when REM predominates and the risk to his bed partner further confirm it. While this technically falls outside F-codes, it's a significant finding given its association with synucleinopathy progression.

For the neurocognitive changes, I need to determine the appropriate coding. The mild cognitive impairment related to his Parkinson's disease would fall under F06.70 if there's no behavioral disturbance, or F06.71 if behavioral symptoms are present. The DSM-5-TR approach to coding mild neurocognitive disorder depends on whether additional behavioral or psychiatric features accompany the cognitive decline.

Looking at the cognitive profile—his struggles with executive function on the Trail Making Test B, visuospatial difficulties with figure copying, and memory retrieval issues despite cueing—these suggest mild neurocognitive changes. His MMSE score of 25/30 sits at the borderline, which supports this impression rather than normal cognition.

The apathy his wife described emerging 1-2 years before his Parkinson's diagnosis is a recognized non-motor feature of the disease, though it doesn't warrant its own diagnostic code. His maintained independence in daily activities and mild forgetfulness indicate the cognitive changes haven't substantially impaired functioning yet.

This cognitive pattern fits the subcortical profile typical of Parkinson's disease—executive and visuospatial deficits with memory problems that improve when given retrieval cues. The primary diagnosis remains the depressive disorder secondary to Parkinson's disease with major depressive features (F06.32), with REM sleep behavior disorder as a secondary consideration. .1) doesn't align with the timeline, and Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood (F43.21) seems less fitting given the severity and duration of symptoms.

Looking at F-codes specifically for the top diagnoses: F06.32 (Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition, With Major Depressive-Like Episode) is the most appropriate primary choice since it directly links the depression to the Parkinson's disease. F32.1 (Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Moderate) could work as an alternative if treating the depression as a separate comorbid condition rather than a direct consequence of the neurological disease. F43.21 (Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood) is also possible but seems less aligned with the clinical presentation.

For neurocognitive considerations, I need to be careful with coding—Mild NCD due to Parkinson's typically uses G31.84 rather than an F-code, while Major NCD due to Parkinson's uses F02.80 or F02.81. The MMSE score of 25/30 falls in a borderline range that requires careful assessment.

Given the clinical presentation and need for multiple diagnostic codes, the most defensible options include F06.32 for depressive disorder due to the medical condition with major depressive features as the primary diagnosis, F32.1 as an alternative framing of major depression, F43.21 for adjustment disorder with depressed mood as a differential consideration, and F02.80 or F02.81 for major neurocognitive disorder if cognitive decline is more significant than the borderline testing suggests.

However, I'm realizing the coding constraints are more limiting than initially apparent. Mild neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson's disease doesn't have an F-code designation—it uses G31.84 instead. Similarly, REM sleep behavior disorder codes to G47.52, not an F-code. This means I need to focus the F-codes on the mood and behavioral disturbances rather than the neurocognitive or sleep components, which narrows the diagnostic options considerably. not a separate anxiety disorder. Sleep-onset insomnia is mentioned but likely stems from the depressive syndrome or PD itself rather than representing its own disorder.

For the primary diagnoses, F06.32 - Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (Parkinson's Disease) with Major Depressive-Like Episode seems most fitting given the clear temporal relationship between PD onset and depressive symptoms. Alternatively, F32.1 - Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Moderate could apply if viewing the depression as an independent comorbidity, since he demonstrates anhedonia, weight loss, insomnia, fatigue, and concentration difficulties in his first depressive episode at moderate severity. F43.21 - Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood also warrants consideration as a potential diagnosis.

For sleep disturbance, F51.01 or F51.9 could capture the sleep-onset insomnia, though the long-standing parasomnias including RBD would be coded separately. F06.8 or F06.70 might address neurocognitive concerns related to the underlying medical condition, though the latter specifically applies to mild neurocognitive impairment due to known physiological causes.

The coding becomes intricate when considering Parkinson's disease etiology—G31.84 applies for mild neurocognitive disorder due to PD, while F02.8x covers major neurocognitive disorder from the same cause. For other medical conditions affecting cognition, F06 codes may be appropriate depending on severity and presentation. Rather than overanalyzing the nuances, a practical differential approach focusing on the primary presenting symptoms and their relationship to the documented medical condition seems most useful.

The most fitting diagnosis appears to be F06.32, capturing the depressive presentation as secondary to the underlying Parkinson's disease. An alternative framing would consider F32.1 if viewing the depression as a primary mood disorder independent of the neurological condition. F43.21 remains possible though less likely given the symptom severity. F02.80 enters consideration for major neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson's disease, though his MMSE score of 25/30 and maintained independence in daily activities suggest he hasn't crossed that threshold yet. F06.8 could also apply as an alternative for other specified mental disorder if the presentation doesn't fit neatly into the above categories.

Regarding REM Sleep Behavior Disorder, this falls outside the F-code mental disorder classification—it's coded as G47.52 under sleep disorders. When an F-code is required, F51.8 (Other Specified Sleep-Wake Disorder) serves as the appropriate mental health coding option.

For the final diagnostic list, I'm settling on: F06.32 for the depressive episode secondary to Parkinson's disease, F32.1 for the moderate major depressive episode, F51.8 to capture the sleep disturbance, F43.21 for adjustment-related mood symptoms, and F06.8 as a catch-all for other physiological contributors. The challenge here is that RBD doesn't cleanly fit within F-code parameters, so using F51.8 as an approximation may be the most practical approach given the constraint. F06.32 is the most fitting primary diagnosis given the clear temporal relationship between his depression and Parkinson's Disease. I should also consider F32.1 as an alternative if viewing the depression as an independent condition rather than secondary to the neurological disorder. F43.21 could apply if this is primarily a psychological adjustment to the PD diagnosis itself. For the sleep disturbance, F51.8 captures the significant REM Sleep Behavior Disorder symptoms, though I note the technical coding distinction. F06.8 might encompass the apathy or other neuropsychiatric manifestations tied to PD that don't fully meet depressive criteria. However, I need to reconsider how to code the RBD given the constraint about F-codes. 06.32 - Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition, With Major Depressive-Like Episode. F32.1 captures moderate severity in a single episode, while F43.21 addresses the adjustment component if stressors are prominent. For the sleep disturbance, F51.8 provides an F-code option that acknowledges RBD symptoms. If the depressive presentation is milder, F32.0 might fit better, though F32.9 could work if there's diagnostic uncertainty about the specific depressive subtype. Persistent Depressive Disorder (F34.1) is also worth considering given the extended timeline of roughly 1-2 years.","1.

118,"A psychiatric transplant liaison service was called to evaluate Robert Jennings, a 50-year-old married white man, for a liver transplant in the context of an alcohol use disorder, advanced cirrhosis, and no other prior psychiatric history. Several weeks earlier, he had been hospitalized with acute alcohol-associated hepatitis and diagnosed with end-stage liver disease. Prednisolone 40 mg/day was prescribed for treatment of the hepatitis. Prior to that hospitalization, he had been unaware that his alcohol consumption was seriously damaging his health and was shocked to learn that he would eventually require a liver transplant. Upon discharge, he began an addiction treatment program that was mandatory for him to be listed for possible transplantation.
 
 Outpatient psychiatric consultation was requested by the transplant team after the patient’s family expressed concern that he had recently become increasingly irritable and anxious and seemed to be having difficulty coping with the requirements for transplantation. Mr. Jennings’s primary care physician had recently prescribed alprazolam 0.5 mg as needed for his anxiety. This was initially helpful, but after several days his family noticed he seemed more irritable, lethargic, and forgetful.
 
 When interviewed, the patient said that he had been tired for months prior to the diagnosis and that the fatigue had hampered his ability to work (his job required making deliveries for a shipping firm). Although the diagnosis had been a shock, he said he had left the hospital feeling “great, better than I’d felt in years.” For about a week after discharge, he described having enhanced energy and a sense of well-being, but he then began to feel anxious and restless. He slept poorly, unable to concentrate, and worried constantly about his health, finances, and family. He became less engaged with his family and stopped watching movies, normally his favorite pastime.
 
 He denied having nightmares, flashbacks, avoidant behaviors, or racing thoughts. He also denied low mood, tearfulness, appetite changes, anhedonia, helplessness, hopelessness, or suicidality. He reported that he had started drinking daily 10 years earlier, stating that he enjoyed the taste of beer and liked socializing with friends after work. He developed tolerance to alcohol, needing to consume six to eight drinks per night to achieve the same effect. He described some withdrawal symptoms in the morning but did not drink during work hours; he underwent random testing due to his job as a truck driver. He did miss some family activities, preferring to drink, and this had been a source of marital conflict. He admitted feeling guilty about his alcohol use and its impact on him and his family. He denied using any alcohol since his hospitalization. He admitted to anger over having to undergo addiction counseling and had argued with the transplant team about this requirement. He denied having been an anxious person and considered himself able to handle most of life’s challenges without being overwhelmed. His family confirmed his description of himself and viewed his recent behavior as uncharacteristic.
 
 On mental status examination, Mr. Jennings was a thin, jaundiced, tired-appearing man. His gait was normal, but he was fidgety while seated. He maintained eye contact and responded appropriately, although he repeatedly made comments like, “Something isn’t right” and “It’s not all in my head.” His affect was anxious and irritable, and his speech was terse. He appeared distracted but denied confusion and disorientation. He had no delusions or hallucinations. His thoughts were logical and coherent, without disorganization, and there was no latency to his responses. He scored 26 out of 30 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, missing points for recall and serial 7s. He scored in the normal range for Trail Making Test A and B but asked to have the instructions repeated for Trails B.","Let me analyze this clinical case vignette carefully to extract relevant information and develop a differential diagnosis.

- Perceptions: No hallucinations
- Cognition: Appeared distracted but denied confusion/disorientation; MoCA 26/30 (missed points for recall and serial 7s); normal Trail Making A and B but asked for instructions to be repeated for Trails B

**Key Contextual Factors:**
- On prednisolone 40 mg/day (corticosteroids can cause psychiatric symptoms)
- On alprazolam (family noticed worsening after starting this)
- Recent major life stressor (diagnosis of end-stage liver disease requiring transplant)
- Liver disease can cause hepatic encephalopathy
- Abstinent from alcohol since hospitalization

**Differential Diagnosis:**

1. **Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety (F

43.22)** or **Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood (F43.23)**
- The end-stage liver disease diagnosis serves as a clear identifiable stressor with symptom onset occurring within weeks
- Presenting with anxiety, restlessness, worry, sleep disturbance, and concentration difficulties that are uncharacteristic per family
- Need to exclude medication or substance-related causes first

2. **Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder (Corticosteroid-induced)**
- High-dose prednisolone (40 mg/day) has a well-established association with anxiety, irritability, insomnia, and mood elevation; symptoms emerged after initiating this medication
- Alprazolam may have paradoxically worsened anxiety despite being an anxiolytic

, with family reporting increased irritability, lethargy, and cognitive changes following its introduction
- The benzodiazepine's effects are particularly concerning given hepatic impairment affecting drug metabolism

3. **Alcohol Use Disorder, Severe (F10.20)**
- Ten-year history of daily consumption with clear tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, and continued use despite marital strain and reduced engagement in valued activities
- If abstinent since hospitalization, would be coded as early remission

4. **Mild Neurocognitive Disorder due to Hepatic Encephalopathy (F06.7)**
- MoCA score of 26/30 sits at the borderline for impairment, with specific deficits in delayed recall and serial subtraction
- End-stage liver disease provides the medical substrate for cognitive decline, compounded by fatigue and concentration problems that family members have observed

5. **Generalized Anxiety Disorder**
- Worry spans health, finances, and family concerns with accompanying sleep and concentration difficulties
- However, the temporal relationship to recent stressors and medication changes suggests adjustment disorder or substance-induced anxiety may better account for the presentation

The most likely primary diagnoses appear to be medication-induced anxiety from corticosteroids, given the characteristic pattern of initial euphoria followed by anxiety and irritability that prednisolone commonly produces. Adjustment disorder with anxiety also warrants consideration due to the clear onset following the end-stage liver disease diagnosis and transplant requirement. The medication effects seem to be playing a substantial role in the current symptom picture.

For alcohol use disorder, the patient meets multiple criteria including tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, drinking in larger amounts than intended, and continued use despite interpersonal consequences—at least five criteria indicating severe presentation. Given the recent hospitalization, early remission status would apply if less than 12 months have elapsed since the last significant use.

The adjustment disorder with anxiety diagnosis captures the psychological component of adapting to the medical situation. Additionally, mild neurocognitive disorder secondary to the liver disease and potential hepatic encephalopathy should be documented, particularly given the cognitive testing findings and reported symptoms.

For the anxiety presentation, I'm considering whether this stems primarily from the corticosteroid use or represents a separate anxiety disorder that warrants monitoring. The alcohol use disorder in early remission remains well-established given the documented history. The final diagnostic formulation prioritizes the adjustment response to the transplant stressor as the primary concern, with substance-induced anxiety from prednisolone as a significant contributing factor. Disorder with Anxiety (F43.22) seems most clinically relevant given the clear stressor of hospitalization and the patient's atypical response pattern. The alcohol use disorder in early remission should be documented as a secondary diagnosis. The corticosteroid contribution is significant—whether coded as medication-induced anxiety or anxiety due to a medical condition—but the adjustment component appears primary given the temporal relationship to discharge and the patient's baseline functioning before the stressor.

The cognitive deficits warrant consideration of mild neurocognitive disorder related to hepatic disease, particularly since the alprazolam may be accumulating due to impaired liver metabolism, contributing more to lethargy and memory problems than to the anxiety itself. This suggests the benzodiazepine is compounding cognitive symptoms rather than driving the anxiety presentation.

For the primary diagnosis, the anxiety and irritability stem from the transplant stressor combined with multiple medical contributors—the alcohol history, corticosteroid effects, and hepatic encephalopathy. The adjustment disorder with anxiety captures the primary psychological response to the transplant situation, while the substance-induced anxiety from corticosteroids and the sedative intoxication from alprazolam accumulation represent secondary factors. The neurocognitive impairment from liver disease also plays a role in the overall clinical picture. ognitive Disorder due to Another Medical Condition (F06.70) as a secondary consideration if cognitive symptoms emerge beyond the adjustment period. However, I'm reconsidering whether Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition might be more fitting given the liver disease could directly contribute to anxiety through hepatic encephalopathy or other physiological pathways. This could be more appropriate than or complementary to the substance-induced diagnosis.

My final diagnostic formulation includes the adjustment disorder as primary, the established alcohol use disorder in early remission, anxiety stemming from the hepatic disease itself, and the corticosteroid contribution to anxiety symptoms. The critical considerations for transplant evaluation are the substance-induced anxiety from prednisolone, which needs to be distinguished from adjustment-related anxiety, and the mild cognitive impairment that could affect transplant consent capacity. I'm settling on these diagnoses: Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety (F43.22), Alcohol Use Disorder, Severe, in Early Remission (F10.21), Other Substance-Induced Anxiety Disorder (F19.980), and Mild Neurocognitive Disorder due to Another Medical Condition (F06.70).

For the fifth diagnosis, I'm reconsidering whether to include both the corticosteroid-induced anxiety and the medically-induced anxiety from liver disease, since they overlap. The F06.4 diagnosis better captures the broader medical context of how the underlying liver condition affects anxiety and cognition. However, I should also consider whether the alprazolam itself is contributing to cognitive symptoms like lethargy and forgetfulness, which might warrant including a sedative-related disorder diagnosis.

Looking at the options, a substance-induced diagnosis for the alprazolam doesn't quite fit since he's taking it as prescribed rather than abusing it. I'll focus on finalizing the core diagnoses: the adjustment disorder with anxiety, the alcohol use disorder in remission, the substance-induced anxiety from corticosteroids, the neurocognitive disorder from the medical condition, and the anxiety disorder tied to the liver disease itself. Condition - F06.70
5. Generalized Anxiety Disorder - F41.1

This seems like a solid diagnostic formulation. The corticosteroid-induced anxiety warrants specific attention though. DSM-5 guidelines indicate that medication-induced psychiatric symptoms should be coded using substance-induced categories, so F19.980 (Other Substance-Induced Anxiety Disorder) is the appropriate code for corticosteroid effects rather than the general medical condition category. Weighing the clinical picture and the iatrogenic component, I'll prioritize capturing the medication's role in the anxiety presentation.

My final differential includes the adjustment disorder as the primary diagnosis, the alcohol use disorder given its transplant relevance, the corticosteroid-induced anxiety, neurocognitive changes from the medical condition, and the underlying anxiety tied to the medical illness itself. This approach addresses the psychosocial stressor, substance history, pharmacological contribution, and organic factors all contributing to the clinical picture.","1.

159,"Peter Winters, a 46-year-old married white minister, was referred to the psychiatry outpatient department by his primary care doctor for depressive symptoms and opioid misuse in the setting of chronic right knee pain.
 
 Mr. Winters injured his right knee playing basketball 17 months earlier. His mother gave him several tablets of hydrocodone-acetaminophen that she had for back pain, and he found this helpful. When he ran out of the pills and his pain persisted, he went to the emergency room. He was told he had a mild sprain. He was given a 1-month supply of hydrocodone-acetaminophen. He took the pills as prescribed for 1 month, and his pain resolved.
 
 After stopping the pills, however, Mr. Winters began to experience a recurrence of the pain in his knee. He saw an orthopedist, who ordered imaging studies and determined that there was no structural damage. Mr. Winters was given another 1-month supply of hydrocodone-acetaminophen. This time, however, he needed to take more than prescribed in order to ease the pain. He also felt dysphoric and “achy” when he abstained from taking the medication, and described a “craving” for more opioids. He returned to the orthopedist, who referred him to a pain specialist.
 
 Mr. Winters was too embarrassed to go to the pain specialist, believing that his faith and strength should help him overcome the pain. He found it impossible to live without the pain medication, however, because of the pain, dysphoria, and muscle aches when he stopped the medication. He also began to “enjoy the high” and experienced intense craving. He began to frequent emergency rooms to receive more opioids, often lying about the timing and nature of his right knee pain, and even stole pills from his mother on two occasions. He became preoccupied with trying to find more opioids, and his work and home life suffered. He endorsed low mood, especially when contemplating the impact of opioids on his life, but denied any other mood or neurovegetative symptoms. Eventually, he told his primary care doctor about his opioid use and low mood, and that doctor referred him to the outpatient psychiatry clinic.
 
 Mr. Winters had a history of two lifetime major depressive episodes that were treated successfully with escitalopram by his primary care doctor. He also had a history of an alcohol use disorder when he was in his 20s. He managed to quit using alcohol on his own after a family intervention. He smoked two packs of cigarettes daily. His father suffered from depression, and “almost everyone” on his mother’s side of the family had “issues with addiction.” He had been married to his wife for 20 years, and they had two school-age children. He had been a minister in his church for 15 years. Results of a recent physical examination and laboratory testing performed by his primary care physician had been within normal limits.
 
 On mental status examination, Mr. Winters was cooperative and did not exhibit any psychomotor abnormalities. He answered most questions briefly, often simply saying “yes” or “no.” Speech was of a normal rate and tone, without tangentiality or circumstantiality. He reported that his mood was “lousy,” and his affect was dysphoric and constricted. He denied symptoms of paranoia or hallucinations. He denied any thoughts of harming himself or others. Memory, both recent and remote, was grossly intact.","Let me analyze this clinical case systematically.

- Recent physical exam and labs: normal

**Mental Status Examination:**
Cooperative and coherent with normal speech patterns. Mood described as ""lousy"" with dysphoric, constricted affect. No psychotic features, suicidal or homicidal ideation. Memory grossly intact.

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

**Opioid Use Disorder (Moderate to Severe)** - F11.20
Multiple diagnostic criteria present: tolerance requiring escalating doses, withdrawal symptoms (dysphoria and achiness), unsuccessful attempts to control use, continued use despite occupational and social consequences, doctor shopping and deception, theft of pills, and preoccupation with obtaining opioids.

**Tobacco Use Disorder** - F17.200
Two packs daily indicates significant nicotine dependence.

**Depressive Symptoms** - Distinguishing primary depression from substance-induced mood changes. Current dysphoria appears situational related to opioid consequences rather than neurovegetative symptoms. Prior history of two major depressive episodes that responded to treatment, though need to clarify whether depression preceded or followed opioid use escalation.

Given the temporal relationship between opioid use and mood decline, plus absence of sleep/appetite/concentration changes, this likely represents opioid-induced depressive disorder rather than recurrent major depression. If depressive symptoms don't fully meet major depressive episode criteria, unspecified depressive disorder may be more appropriate coding.

For alcohol, he has a documented history of moderate-to-severe use disorder in his twenties that resolved after family intervention and has remained abstinent since then, warranting a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder in sustained early remission. Disorder, in sustained remission.""

The past major depressive episodes—two of them treated successfully—warrant F33.40 for recurrent disorder in full remission, since he's not currently meeting depressive criteria. Though if I'm considering his current mood symptoms, F33.41 (partial remission) might be more appropriate.

Organizing the diagnostic picture: opioid use disorder, moderate to severe, is the primary concern. Secondary diagnoses include severe tobacco use disorder, the recurrent depression in remission, and the alcohol use disorder in sustained remission. For his current depressive symptoms, I should consider whether to code an unspecified depressive disorder or whether these are better understood as opioid-induced mood disturbance.

The coding nuances matter here—opioid-induced depressive disorder codes differ based on severity of the underlying use disorder (F11.14 for mild, F11.24 for moderate/severe). Given that he meets multiple OUD criteria including tolerance, withdrawal, craving, loss of control, time spent using, abandoned activities, and continued use despite consequences, this appears to be severe rather than moderate, supporting F11.20 for the primary opioid use disorder diagnosis.

For tobacco, the 2 packs daily consumption clearly indicates a severe pattern. His alcohol history shows past problematic use in his twenties that resolved after family intervention, with sustained abstinence over the last two decades. The depressive symptoms present a diagnostic question—whether they represent a separate depressive disorder or are secondary to the opioid use. If independent, unspecified depressive disorder captures current symptoms that fall short of a full major depressive episode. However, if substance-induced, the opioid-induced depressive disorder code would subsume this presentation. His prior major depressive episodes were successfully treated and remain in remission.

Regarding the current mood disturbance, the limited scope—low mood only when reflecting on opioid consequences, without neurovegetative symptoms—suggests this may be better understood as part of the opioid use disorder itself rather than a distinct mood diagnosis. An adjustment disorder with depressed mood could apply given the stressor of recognizing opioid impact on his life, though the symptoms appear subthreshold for a full depressive episode. Given his established history of recurrent major depression now in remission, the current presentation doesn't clearly warrant an additional mood diagnosis separate from acknowledging that prior condition. d its consequences. The current depressive symptoms seem tied to his opioid use—dysphoria during withdrawal and low mood when considering the impact of his addiction—though they may not rise to the level of opioid-induced depression unless they exceed what intoxication or withdrawal alone would explain.

I'm settling on Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood as the fifth diagnosis since the symptoms appear reactive to his OUD and its effects, rather than a separate depressive episode. The tobacco code appears incomplete, so I need to verify the full sequence. For the depressive disorder diagnosis, I'm uncertain whether F32.A is the most accurate code for unspecified depressive disorder—it might be F32.9 for single episode or F33.9 if recurrent, so I should double-check which applies to this case.

For the alcohol use disorder in remission, F10.21 seems correct. Looking at the final diagnostic list, I have opioid use disorder coded as F11.20, tobacco use disorder as F17.200, major depressive disorder in full remission as F33.40, and alcohol use disorder in sustained remission, though the code appears to be cut off.

Regarding the current depressive presentation, the patient's low mood appears situational—tied to contemplating opioid use consequences—without other mood or neurovegetative symptoms. This raises the question of whether a separate depressive diagnosis is warranted. Given his significant history of recurrent MDD and family psychiatric history, he's vulnerable to future episodes, but his current symptoms don't clearly cross the threshold for a distinct disorder. The presentation could reflect demoralization from his substance use, opioid-induced mood changes, an adjustment response, or early signs of another depressive episode. For the fifth diagnosis, since he doesn't solidly meet criteria for a depressive disorder at present, other diagnostic options warrant consideration.","1. Opioid Use Disorder, Severe - F11.20

1021,"The patient is an 18-year-old non-binary college freshman with a complex psychiatric presentation. They report a history of childhood anxiety, perfectionism, and ritualistic self-punishment behaviors starting in the third grade. Currently, their most debilitating symptom is anxiety about ""contaminated air"" when others cough or sneeze, prompting them to cover their face and hold their breath even when the trigger is far away or on television. They engage in checking and counting behaviors based on the number 3, including checking mirrors while driving, locking/unlocking their car, and tapping their toothbrush. These compulsions are experienced as uncontrollable, with the patient reporting they sometimes modify behaviors (like holding an imaginary door handle in their pocket) when the original compulsion would be disruptive. At approximately age 16, the patient developed anorexia nervosa, restricting their food intake and ultimately requiring intervention from parents and a treatment team. Despite gaining weight under external pressure, the patient continues to restrict eating, has a distinct fear of gaining weight, becoming fat, fasting until dinner, drinking coffee to intentionally upset their stomach. Their BMI currently falls within the normal range. Around the same time their eating disorder developed, the patient experienced depressive symptoms including hopelessness, low motivation, and self-harm behaviors (pulling hair, cutting, punching stomach). They had suicidal ideation during high school, including thoughts of jumping in front of a train and fantasizing about wandering into hallways during a school shooting. Current suicidal thoughts are less frequent and persistent. Current depressive symptoms have been subsyndromal (though not entirely absent) for about 7 months. Specifically, the patient currently denies experiencing depressive symptoms for more than a few hours every couple of weeks but rates their chance of self-harm in the next three months at 50% (suicide attempt chance at 0%). They report minimal alcohol and marijuana use. Notably, the patient expresses resistance to treatment, stating that ""getting better means getting fat"" and feeling they need to ""stay sad for a while longer"".","Let me carefully analyze this clinical case vignette to extract relevant information and build a differential diagnosis.

**Data Extraction and Organization:**

Demographics:
- 18-year-old non-binary college freshman

Presenting symptoms and history:

1. **OCD-related symptoms (onset ~3rd grade, age ~8-9):**
- Childhood anxiety and perfectionism
- Ritualistic self-punishment behaviors
- Contamination fears - specifically about ""contaminated air"" when others cough/sneeze
- Avoidance behaviors (covering face, holding breath) even when trigger is distant or on TV
- Checking behaviors (mirrors while driving, locking/unlocking car)
- Counting behaviors based on number 3
- Tapping toothbrush
- Compulsions experienced as uncontrollable
- Modifies behaviors when original compulsion would be disruptive (holding imaginary door handle)

2. **Eating Disorder symptoms (onset ~age 16):**
- Developed anorexia nervosa
- Food restriction requiring intervention from parents and treatment team
- Gained weight under external pressure but continues to restrict
- Distinct fear of gaining weight/becoming fat
- Fasts until dinner
- Drinks coffee to intentionally upset stomach
- BMI currently within normal range
- Resistance to treatment: ""getting better means getting fat""

3. **Depressive symptoms (onset around same time as eating disorder, ~age 16):**
- Hopelessness
- Low motivation
- Self-harm behaviors (pulling hair, cutting, punching stomach)
- Suicidal ideation in high school (thoughts of jumping in front of train, fantasizing about wandering into hallways during school shooting)
- Current suicidal thoughts less frequent and persistent
- Current depressive symptoms subsyndromal for about 7 months
- Depressive symptoms occur for a few hours every couple of weeks
- Self-harm risk rated at 50% in next 3 months
- Suicide attempt chance rated at 0%


- Expresses belief that maintaining sadness is necessary

4. **Substance use:**
- Minimal alcohol and marijuana use

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

1. **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (F42.2):**
Clear obsessions around contamination fears with multiple compulsions (checking, counting, tapping) that are time-consuming, uncontrollable, and cause significant distress. Long-standing pattern since childhood with recognition that behaviors are excessive.

2. **Anorexia Nervosa:**
History of restrictive eating disorder at age 16 with weight restoration, though current BMI remains normal. Continues to restrict intake, fears weight gain, and uses compensatory behaviors like coffee consumption. Expresses resistance to recovery, viewing improvement as equivalent to becoming overweight. Given persistent restrictive behaviors and weight concerns despite normalized BMI, this appears to be either Anorexia Nervosa in partial remission or potentially Atypical Anorexia Nervosa if BMI has never been significantly low.

The most fitting diagnosis is Anorexia Nervosa, Restricting type, In Partial Remission (F50.01)—the individual previously met full criteria but now maintains normal weight while still experiencing intense fear of weight gain and restrictive eating patterns.

3. **Major Depressive Disorder:**

The clinical picture includes a long history of depressive episodes beginning in adolescence, with current symptoms of hopelessness and low motivation appearing only intermittently—a few hours every couple of weeks for the past seven months. This pattern of subsyndromal presentation following previously met full criteria points to **Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, In Partial Remission (F32.4)**. The vignette doesn't establish multiple distinct episodes, so a single episode diagnosis is most appropriate.

4. **Nonsuicidal Self-Injury (NSSI):**

The individual has engaged in self-harm through hair pulling, cutting, and punching the stomach.

Current risk of self-harm is estimated at 50%, which falls under Section III of DSM-5 as a condition warranting further study. While hair pulling could suggest **Trichotillomania (F63.3)**, the behavior appears embedded within broader self-harm rather than the characteristic urge-gratification cycle typical of trichotillomania.

5. **Other considerations:**

Early anxiety symptoms were present, though **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder** better explains the current clinical presentation. **Body Dysmorphic Disorder** was considered given OCD spectrum overlap, but weight and eating concerns seem more central than preoccupation with specific body defects.

**Final Differential Diagnosis:**

1. **Primary: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (F42.2)** - Currently the most functionally impairing condition, with identifiable obsessions and compulsions, chronic course, and marked impairment in daily functioning. The self-injurious behaviors appear driven by obsessive content rather than representing a separate primary disorder.

2. **Anorexia Nervosa, Restricting type, In Partial Remission (F50.01)** - Established history of full syndrome, currently at normal BMI but with persistent restrictive eating patterns and weight gain anxiety.

3. **Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, In Partial Remission (F32.4)** - Prior major depressive episode with ongoing subsyndromal depressive symptoms persisting for several months.

4. **Nonsuicidal Self-Injury** - Listed in DSM-5 Section III without a standard F code, though self-harm behaviors warrant clinical attention and monitoring.

5. **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1)** - Early-onset anxiety with perfectionism and worry patterns that have persisted across the lifespan.

The trichotillomania appears secondary to the underlying distress rather than a primary diagnosis. Childhood anxiety history and perfectionism traits align better with generalized anxiety presentation than a separate anxiety disorder code. The core diagnostic picture centers on OCD as the primary driver, with eating disorder and mood symptoms as significant comorbidities. For the remaining diagnoses, the childhood anxiety and perfectionism fit better with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1) rather than creating a separate anxiety diagnosis. The ritualistic self-punishment behaviors starting in elementary school appear connected to the OCD presentation rather than a distinct condition. While obsessive-compulsive personality traits are evident—particularly the perfectionism and need for control—there isn't sufficient detail about interpersonal dysfunction or other OCPD criteria to warrant a formal diagnosis. The primary diagnoses are OCD as the most functionally impairing condition, followed by the eating disorder and depression with their respective partial remission specifiers. for meeting full criteria, though the perfectionism and control-seeking behaviors are notable. The self-harm patterns and treatment resistance suggest possible personality features, but there's insufficient information for a definitive diagnosis in that domain.

I'm settling on OCD as the fifth diagnosis instead—the obsessive thought patterns and compulsive behaviors fit better than adding a redundant anxiety disorder. My final list is: OCD, Anorexia Nervosa (Restricting, Partial Remission), Major Depressive Disorder (Single Episode, Partial Remission), Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and I should reconsider whether a fifth diagnosis is even necessary or if trichotillomania might be more appropriate given the self-injurious behaviors mentioned. The primary diagnosis is Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder given the ritualistic self-punishment behaviors and OCD spectrum features. Secondary diagnoses include Anorexia Nervosa (Restricting type, In Partial Remission) as a significant eating disorder, Major Depressive Disorder (Single Episode, In Partial Remission) reflecting the mood disturbance, Generalized Anxiety Disorder stemming from childhood anxiety patterns, and Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder traits evidenced by perfectionism and rigidity. For OCPD specifically, I'm checking whether enough criteria are met—preoccupation with details and order, perfectionism interfering with completion, excessive work devotion, and heightened moral conscientiousness are present in the presentation.

Looking at the evidence more carefully, I only have clear documentation of perfectionism. Without additional criteria like hoarding behaviors, reluctance to delegate, miserly spending, or rigidity in relationships, OCPD may not meet threshold. The contamination fears and checking rituals align more directly with OCD and childhood-onset GAD, so those diagnoses capture the anxiety presentation well. Substance use appears minimal and doesn't warrant a separate diagnosis. Body image concerns seem rooted in the eating disorder rather than specific body dysmorphic preoccupations. A fifth diagnosis might be Unspecified Anxiety Disorder if there are residual anxiety symptoms not fully accounted for by the other diagnoses.

My working diagnoses are: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (F42.2), Anorexia Nervosa Restricting Type in Partial Remission (F50.01), Major Depressive Disorder Single Episode in Partial Remission (F32.4), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1), and Unspecified Personality Disorder (F60.9) given the complex presentation and self-harm patterns. The resistance to treatment—statements like ""getting better means getting fat"" and reluctance to fully recover—could reflect ego-syntonic features of the eating disorder, underlying personality factors, or ambivalence about change itself.

Reconsidering the personality disorder diagnosis, there isn't quite enough evidence for a clear diagnosis. The childhood anxiety and perfectionism seem better captured within the anxiety and OCD framework rather than as a separate personality pathology. I'll finalize the list as: OCD, Anorexia Nervosa Restricting Type in Partial Remission, Major Depressive Disorder Single Episode in Partial Remission, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder to account for the longitudinal anxiety pattern from childhood.

The self-harm behaviors—cutting, hair pulling, stomach punching—present a diagnostic challenge. These could reflect depressive symptoms or non-suicidal self-injury, though the latter is a Section III condition without a standard F code. Trying to force them into a disruptive behavior category doesn't align with the clinical picture.

In ICD-10, intentional self-harm falls under external cause codes rather than psychiatric diagnoses, so I'd conceptualize these behaviors as manifestations of the mood and anxiety disorders already identified. My working diagnostic list includes OCD as the primary condition given its severity and chronicity, AN in partial remission capturing the ongoing eating pathology, MDD in partial remission for subsyndromal mood symptoms, GAD reflecting the longstanding anxiety pattern, and potentially an unspecified condition if additional features emerge.

However, listing both GAD and an unspecified anxiety disorder creates redundancy. Looking at what might constitute a fifth diagnosis—specific phobia for contamination fears, social anxiety, illness anxiety disorder, somatic symptom disorder, PTSD, or borderline personality features—none seem clearly warranted by the clinical picture. The contamination concerns appear integral to the OCD rather than a separate phobia, trauma history isn't documented, and while self-harm and mood fluctuations are present, they don't meet full BPD criteria. The ritualistic self-punishment mentioned seems better understood as part of the OCD and depressive pathology rather than indicating a distinct fifth condition. ive Disorder - F42 (current, moderate severity)
2. Major Depressive Disorder - F32.1 (current, moderate severity, in partial remission)
3. Generalized Anxiety Disorder - F41.1
4. Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder - F43.10
5. Unspecified Personality Disorder - F60.9

The subsyndromal depressive pattern over seven months with intermittent symptoms suggests a discrete depressive episode rather than chronic low-grade depression, making MDD in partial remission more fitting than persistent depressive disorder. At eighteen, personality features like perfectionism and treatment resistance are still crystallizing, but the self-harm patterns and complexity warrant monitoring for emerging personality pathology. F42.2 captures the mixed presentation with both obsessional thoughts and compulsive behaviors. For the eating disorder, F50.01 correctly reflects the restricting subtype, and the partial remission status applies to this code. The MDD coding follows similarly, with F32.4 denoting a single episode in partial remission.

The resistance to treatment and statements like ""getting better means getting fat"" align with the ego-syntonic nature of anorexia rather than indicating a separate personality pathology. These cognitions are characteristic of the eating disorder itself. GAD warrants F41.1, and the unspecified personality disorder would be F60.9 if clinically indicated. The final diagnostic picture centers on the eating disorder as the primary driver, with the obsessive-compulsive and depressive features understood within that context.

Compulsive Disorder - F42.2 (primary, most debilitating)
2. Anorexia Nervosa, Restricting type, In Partial Remission - F50.01
3. Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, In Partial Remission - F32.4
4. Generalized Anxiety Disorder - F41.1 (childhood anxiety)

The self-harm behaviors—cutting, hair pulling, stomach punching—with significant ongoing risk warrant consideration of an impulse-control diagnosis. F91.8 (Other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder) could capture this, though it doesn't perfectly align with the clinical presentation. The self-injurious behaviors may be better understood as manifestations of the underlying anxiety and depressive disorders rather than a distinct impulse-control condition.

Looking back at the childhood history, the ritualistic self-punishment patterns emerging in third grade suggest possible early OCD features rather than purely anxiety-based symptoms. This could indicate the obsessive-compulsive pathology has been present longer than initially apparent, with the self-harm serving as a compulsive response to intrusive thoughts or perfectionist standards.

For the fifth diagnosis, persistent depressive disorder doesn't fit the timeline since the subsyndromal symptoms have only lasted seven months, falling short of the two-year requirement. Social anxiety disorder and specific phobia are less clearly supported by the clinical presentation. The contamination-related fears remain better explained through an OCD lens than as a discrete phobia.

My final diagnostic formulation centers on OCD as the primary condition with multiple comorbidities. Anorexia nervosa in the restricting type shows partial remission, as does the major depressive episode. Generalized anxiety disorder captures the broader anxiety that preceded the obsessive-compulsive symptoms. An unspecified personality disorder diagnosis reflects the complexity of the case, including treatment resistance and self-harm behaviors that suggest emerging personality pathology beyond the primary Axis I conditions.","1.

The clinical picture points to Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Severe with Psychotic Features. The patient has sustained depressed mood over four months with five or more depressive symptoms including anhedonia, weight loss, insomnia, fatigue, poor concentration, and active suicidal ideation—all causing marked functional decline at work. The mood-congruent delusions about causing the dog's death and impending arrest, combined with the absence of any prior manic or hypomanic episodes, support this diagnosis over bipolar disorder.

Medical workup has excluded organic causes like thyroid dysfunction, B12 or folate deficiency. The absence of any history of elevated mood episodes effectively rules out bipolar presentations. I should also consider whether this could be a recurrent episode rather than a first episode, though the patient reports no prior psychiatric treatment. Schizoaffective disorder remains on the differential given the psychotic features, though the clear temporal relationship between mood symptoms and delusions favors a mood disorder with psychosis rather than a primary psychotic illness.

The patient's recent escalation in alcohol use—from one to two glasses nightly for sleep—warrants attention, though this appears more as a coping mechanism than meeting substance use disorder criteria at this point. Other diagnostic possibilities like adjustment disorder or delusional disorder fit less well given the severity and duration of symptoms. The most parsimonious diagnosis remains Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Severe with Psychotic Features (F32.3), with bipolar disorder remaining important to monitor given treatment differences. meet criteria for even mild AUD. The increased alcohol use is concerning as a coping mechanism, but the modest escalation from one to two glasses nightly doesn't yet constitute a diagnosable disorder.

Other considerations include unspecified anxiety disorder given the psychomotor agitation, though the anxiety appears secondary to the depressive presentation. Brief psychotic disorder doesn't fit given the extended duration and prominence of mood symptoms.

The most likely diagnoses are major depressive disorder with psychotic features—either a single episode or recurrent if prior episodes emerge in the history—with bipolar I disorder remaining important to rule out. Schizoaffective disorder and delusional disorder round out the differential, though they're less probable given the clear mood component driving the presentation. 5. Delusional Disorder - F22

The patient had previously worked full-time as an accountant and was married with 2 children. On assessment, the patient is mute with poor hygiene. Her face at times will scrunch during the interview. She sits motionless in a chair, not answering any questions. She stares blankly at the psychiatrist and is unable to engage. When asked if she can stick her tongue out, she does not follow the simple command. The psychiatrist conducts a musculoskeletal exam and when they move her arm, they are met initially with a large amount of resistance that slowly decreases with time. The psychiatrist moves the patient’s arm above her head, and the pt leaves it there after the psychiatrist lets go.","Let me carefully analyze this clinical case vignette to extract the relevant information and develop a differential diagnosis.

**Data Extraction and Organization:**

Demographics:
- 36-year-old female

Psychiatric History:
- Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) diagnosed at age 20
- Has been on Zoloft (sertraline) for years
- Lost insurance 6 months ago and has been off Zoloft for 6 months

Psychosocial History:
- Previously worked full-time as an accountant
- Married with 2 children
- Functional prior to current presentation

Presenting Complaint/Reason for Admission:
- Bizarre behavior noted by mother
- Not eating
- Staring blankly at walls
- Not attending to hygiene

Mental Status Examination:
- Mute (not speaking)
- Poor hygiene
- Facial grimacing (face will scrunch during interview)
- Sits motionless in chair
- Does not answer questions
- Stares blankly
- Unable to engage
- Does not follow simple commands (e.g., stick out tongue)

Physical/Neurological Examination:
- Waxy flexibility (gegenhalten) - arm initially shows resistance that slowly decreases
- Catalepsy - maintains arm position after psychiatrist places it above her head and lets go

**Key Clinical Features Identified:**

The presentation is highly suggestive of CATATONIA based on the following features:
1. Mutism - not speaking
2. Stupor - not responding to environment, motionless
3. Catalepsy - maintaining postures (arm above head)
4. Waxy flexibility (gegenhalten) - initial resistance that slowly gives way
5. Posturing - maintaining position against gravity
6. Negativism - not following commands (could also be interpreted as this)
7. Grimacing - facial movements

According to DSM-5-TR, catatonia requires 3 or more of the following 12 symptoms:


stupor, catalepsy, waxy flexibility, mutism, negativism, posturing, mannerism, stereotypy, agitation, grimacing, echolalia, and echopraxia. This patient clearly demonstrates at least six of these features—mutism, stupor, catalepsy, waxy flexibility, posturing, and grimacing—well exceeding the diagnostic threshold.

**Differential Diagnosis:**

1. **Catatonia associated with another mental disorder (Depressive Disorder with Catatonic Features)**

—most likely given the patient's documented history of major depressive disorder, six-month medication discontinuation, and previous functional baseline inconsistent with primary psychosis. Catatonia frequently accompanies severe depression. The appropriate coding approach involves identifying the underlying mood disorder and applying the catatonic specifier rather than using the general catatonia code (F06.1), which applies only to medical etiologies. For this presentation, I'd code Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, severe, with catatonic features. Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Severe (F33.2) fits given the patient's MDD history since age 20 and current deterioration after six months off medication. For schizophrenia, the catatonic subtype no longer exists in DSM-5-TR, and there's insufficient evidence of psychotic symptoms like hallucinations or delusions to support that diagnosis, though F20.9 (unspecified) remains a possibility. Brief Psychotic Disorder with Catatonic Features (F23) could apply if this represents a new psychotic episode. Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder (F29) and Catatonic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (F06.1) should be considered pending medical workup to exclude encephalitis or autoimmune etiologies. The most fitting primary diagnosis appears to be Catatonia Associated with Another Mental Disorder (F06.1) in the context of the underlying Major Depressive Disorder, with the secondary diagnosis being Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Severe (F33.2). 3. Schizophrenia - F20.9 (as a consideration)
4. Brief Psychotic Disorder - F23
5. Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder - F29

Reconsidering the diagnostic approach, the primary presentation should be Major Depressive Disorder, Severe with catatonic features coded as F33.2 paired with F06.1 for the catatonia specifier. When catatonia accompanies a mental disorder like depression, the underlying condition receives the primary diagnosis while the catatonia gets its own code rather than being listed separately.

The differential diagnosis should include schizophrenia with catatonic features, brief psychotic disorder, and schizoaffective disorder depressive type, given the complexity of the presentation and the need to rule out primary psychotic disorders before attributing symptoms to the mood disorder.","1.

115,"Nadine was a 15-year-old girl whose mother brought her for a psychiatric evaluation to help with her long-standing shyness.
 
 Although Nadine was initially reluctant to say much about herself, she said she felt constantly tense. She added that the anxiety had been “really bad” for several years and was often accompanied by episodes of dizziness and crying. She was generally unable to speak in any situation outside of her home or school classes. She refused to leave her house alone for fear of being forced to interact with someone. She was especially anxious around other teenagers, but she had also become “too nervous” to speak to adult neighbors she had known for years. She said it felt impossible to walk into a restaurant and order from “a stranger at the counter” for fear of being humiliated. She also felt constantly on her guard, needing to avoid the possibility of getting attacked, a strategy that really only worked when she was alone in her home.
 
 Nadine tried to conceal her crippling anxiety from her parents, typically telling them that she “just didn’t feel like” going out. Feeling trapped and incompetent, Nadine said she contemplated suicide “all the time.” In the month before her mother finally brought her in for a psychiatric evaluation, Nadine had begun to cut herself on her thighs to “feel pain and relieve stress.” No one in the family was aware of this development.
 
 Nadine had always been “shy” and had been teased at recess since she started kindergarten. The teasing had escalated to outright bullying by the time she was in seventh grade. The bullying took on a cultural/racially motivated undertone; Nadine and her family were of a different ethnicity than the vast majority of her schoolmates. For 2 years, day after difficult day, Nadine’s peers turned on her “like a snarling wolf pack,” calling her “stupid,” “ugly,” and “crazy.” Not infrequently, one of them would stare at her and tell her she would be better off committing suicide. One girl (the ringleader, as well as a former elementary school chum) hit Nadine on one occasion, giving her a black eye. Nadine did not fight back. This event was witnessed by an adult neighbor, who told Nadine’s mother. When Nadine’s mother asked her about the incident, Nadine denied it, saying she had “fallen” on the street. She did, however, mention to her mother “in passing” that she wanted to switch schools, but her delivery was so offhand that at the time, her mother casually advised against the switch. Nadine suffered on, sobbing herself to sleep most nights and wishing that she would not wake up.
 
 Full of hope and ideas of escape from the bullies and their narrowness, Nadine transferred to a specialty arts high school for ninth grade. Although the bullying ceased, her anxiety symptoms paradoxically worsened. She felt even more unable to venture into public spaces and felt increasingly embarrassed by her inability to develop the sort of independence typical of a 15-year-old. She said she had begun to spend whole weekends “trapped” in her home and had become scared to even read by herself in the local park. Nadine’s social anxiety had evolved into true agoraphobia. She had nightly nightmares about the bullies in her old school. Her preoccupation with suicide grew.
 
 Her parents had thought she would outgrow being shy and sought psychiatric help for her only after a teacher remarked that her anxiety and social isolation were keeping her from making the sort of grades and doing the sort of extracurricular activities that were necessary to get into a good college.
 
 Nadine described her mother as loud, excitable, aggressive, and “a little frightening.” Her father was a successful tax attorney who worked long hours. Nadine described him as shy in social situations (“He’s more like me”). Nadine said she and her father sometimes joked that the goal of any evening was to avoid tipping the mother into a rage. Nadine added that she “never wanted to be anything like her mother.”","Let me carefully analyze this clinical case vignette to extract the relevant information and develop a differential diagnosis.

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

1. **Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia) - F40.10**
The presentation clearly demonstrates this condition. The core features include marked fear of social evaluation, avoidance of situations where she might be judged or embarrassed, persistent anxiety that's disproportionate to actual threat, and significant functional impairment across academic and social domains that has developed since childhood and progressively worsened.

2. **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) - F43.10**
The evidence strongly supports this diagnosis given the prolonged bullying trauma. She meets Criterion A through exposure to serious threat during two years of bullying involving physical violence and suicidal encouragement. Criterion B is evident through the nightly nightmares about her attackers. Criterion C is demonstrated by her extensive avoidance patterns.

Additionally, she exhibits Criterion D through negative cognitive shifts and mood disturbances—feelings of inadequacy and suicidal thoughts—and Criterion E through constant hypervigilance and defensive positioning to prevent further harm. The symptom duration exceeds one month with clear distress and functional decline. Notably, her symptoms intensified after the bullying ended, which aligns with typical PTSD presentation.

3. **Agoraphobia - F40.00**
She explicitly developed agoraphobia from her social anxiety, showing fear and avoidance across multiple situations: public transit, open spaces, enclosed areas, crowds, and being alone outside her home. She avoids these contexts because she perceives escape or assistance as unavailable, with anxiety reliably triggered in these settings and resulting in complete avoidance—refusing to leave home unaccompanied or visit public spaces.

4. **Major Depressive Disorder - F32.x or F33.x**
The presentation includes active suicidal ideation and passive death wishes, alongside feelings of entrapment and worthlessness. She regularly cries herself to sleep, suggesting significant mood disturbance. However, the clinical picture lacks clear documentation of depressed mood as a primary feature, anhedonia, appetite changes, concentration problems, fatigue, or psychomotor symptoms. The suicidal ideation may stem primarily from her PTSD and anxiety rather than representing independent depression, though the frequent nighttime sobbing during the bullying period warrants consideration of a depressive component.

5. **Nonsuicidal Self-Injury (NSSI)**
She's engaged in cutting for approximately a month as a coping mechanism—deliberately inflicting pain to manage stress. While not a primary DSM-5-TR diagnosis, this represents a significant clinical concern and suicide risk indicator requiring immediate attention.

6. **Generalized Anxiety Disorder - F41.1**
She describes persistent tension and experiences dizziness episodes, but her anxiety centers on social contexts and trauma-related triggers rather than the diffuse worry across multiple life domains characteristic of GAD.

7. **Selective Mutism - F94.0**
She struggles to speak outside home and classroom settings, though this appears driven by underlying social anxiety rather than representing the core mechanism of the disorder.

The hierarchy of diagnoses becomes clearer when considering severity and functional impact. Social Anxiety Disorder stands as the foundational condition—lifelong shyness since kindergarten that pervasively restricts her activities. The bullying trauma then layered PTSD symptoms including nightmares, hypervigilance, and avoidance patterns that paradoxically intensified even after the bullying ceased. Agoraphobia has also developed, with her increasingly unable to leave home safely.

The depressive presentation is significant—chronic suicidal ideation, feelings of worthlessness, and sleep disruption from crying. While these symptoms could reflect PTSD's emotional toll, the persistent nature and severity suggest comorbid Major Depressive Disorder. Additionally, she engages in nonsuicidal self-injury as a coping mechanism.

For the diagnostic formulation, I'm considering whether to code Unspecified Depressive Disorder or stick with a more specific MDD diagnosis. Adjustment Disorder doesn't fit given the symptom duration and severity exceeding what would be expected. Panic Disorder is less likely since the dizziness episodes aren't clearly panic-related. Avoidant Personality Disorder patterns are present but inappropriate to diagnose at age 15.

My primary diagnoses would be Social Anxiety Disorder as the most prominent and long-standing condition that directly prompted treatment, followed by PTSD given the clear trauma history from bullying and assault with resulting nightmares and hypervigilance. Agoraphobia has distinctly evolved as a separate condition—she's unable to leave home or access public spaces due to fears of being trapped or unable to escape, which differs from the social anxiety component. Major Depressive Disorder appears warranted given the chronic suicidal ideation, feelings of incompetence, sleep disruption, and significant functional decline. For a fifth diagnosis, Generalized Anxiety Disorder could apply, though the anxiety presentation is more specifically tied to social and trauma-related triggers. diagnoses. The self-injury is clinically significant and worth considering—while NSSI lacks a formal F-code, the cutting behavior could reflect emerging personality pathology or be better captured within the mood and trauma framework. Given the age and presentation, I'm cautious about personality disorder coding but recognize this as an important clinical feature.

For the fifth diagnosis, GAD seems most appropriate given the pervasive tension and physical symptoms extending beyond social contexts. This gives me: Social Anxiety Disorder, PTSD, Agoraphobia, Major Depressive Disorder (moderate), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Though I should note the severity of the suicidal ideation—described as constant—might actually warrant upgrading the depression to severe rather than moderate.

The key question is whether PTSD should take precedence. The bullying was clearly traumatic, but her anxiety has deeper roots—she was shy from early childhood and faced teasing long before the recent bullying intensified things. Her mother sought help for the shyness itself, not trauma recovery. So while PTSD is definitely present and significant, the social anxiety appears to be the foundational pattern that made her vulnerable to the later trauma. I'll keep Social Anxiety Disorder as the primary diagnosis with PTSD as a substantial secondary concern.","1. Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia) - F40.10

1009,"Erin is a 16 year old girl that was brought to her pediatric for a routine health exam. Erin is a sophomore at the local high school, plays lacrosse and does ballet at the local arts theatre. Erin reports that she has had no problems with depressed, sad or hopeless mood symptoms, and denied problems with excessive worry or panic. She lives at home with her two mothers, older brother and their dog Fiji. The patient does report that she goes to the gym for about 3 hours each day of the week, during which she does about 2.5 hours of cardiovascular training. She states she skip lunch on most days, has a sliced apple for breakfast, and take her dinner to her bedroom to slowly eat the vegetable portion of dinner (only) over a period of about 3 hours. Menarche was at age 13.5, but she has missed 3 of her last periods. She reports a lot of gastric reflex, and its wakes her up at night time. She also reports “I don’t really have bowel movements anymore, so I take a laxative in the morning and at night time.” She aims to eat less than 1000 calories in a day.","Let me analyze this clinical case vignette carefully.

**Data Extraction and Organization:**

Demographics:
- 16-year-old female
- Sophomore in high school
- Active in lacrosse and ballet
- Lives with two mothers, older brother, and dog

Behavioral patterns:
- Exercises approximately 3 hours daily, 7 days/week
- 2.5 hours of cardiovascular training per session
- Skips lunch on most days
- Breakfast: sliced apple only
- Dinner: only vegetable portion, eaten slowly over 3 hours in bedroom (isolated eating)
- Aims to eat less than 1000 calories per day
- Uses laxatives twice daily (morning and nighttime)

Physical symptoms:
- Menarche at 13.5 years
- Amenorrhea - missed 3 of last periods (secondary amenorrhea)
- Gastric reflux (esophageal reflux, likely from laxative abuse and/or potential purging)
- Constipation (""doesn't have bowel movements anymore"")
- Sleep disturbance due to gastric reflux

Mental status:
- Denies depressed mood, sadness, hopelessness
- Denies excessive worry or panic
- No reported mood or anxiety symptoms

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

This presentation is highly consistent with **Anorexia Nervosa, Restricting Type**:

1. **Restriction of energy intake** - clearly present with:
   - Skipping meals (lunch)
   - Minimal breakfast (sliced apple)
   - Only eating vegetables at dinner
   - Goal of <1000 calories/day
   - Prolonged eating time (3 hours for dinner)

2. **Significantly low body weight** - although BMI is not explicitly stated, the presentation strongly suggests:
   - Severe caloric restriction
   - Excessive exercise
   - Secondary amenorrhea (missing 3 periods)
   - Laxative misuse
   
3. **Intense drive to prevent weight gain** manifests through multiple compensatory mechanisms: intense daily exercise regimen, strict caloric ceiling, and laxative misuse twice daily. The loss of menstrual function after normal menarche points to significant metabolic compromise from sustained malnutrition, likely involving hypothalamic dysfunction.

4. **Distorted body image** underlies these behaviors, though she hasn't explicitly articulated weight or shape concerns.

The restricting subtype fits better than binge-eating/purging given the primary mechanism is caloric limitation rather than binge episodes. The DSM-5-TR distinguishes between restricting type (no binge eating or purging in the last 3 months) and binge-eating/purging type (recurrent binge eating or purging behaviors including laxative misuse). Given her twice-daily laxative use, this presentation fits the binge-eating/purging type. The primary diagnosis would be Anorexia Nervosa, Binge-Eating/Purging Type (F50.02), supported by caloric restriction, likely low body weight evidenced by amenorrhea and constipation, excessive exercise, and the laxative misuse.

Other considerations include ARFID, which is less likely since her restrictive eating appears motivated by weight and body image concerns rather than food avoidance; Bulimia Nervosa, which would require documented binge episodes and assessment of current weight; and Other Specified or Unspecified Feeding or Eating Disorder if full criteria aren't met for anorexia nervosa.

Exercise compulsion and laxative misuse aren't standalone diagnoses but rather features of the eating disorder presentation. Body Dysmorphic Disorder and OCD could present with similar behaviors, but her symptoms are better accounted for by the eating disorder itself. She denies depressive or anxiety symptoms with no supporting evidence.

The most likely diagnosis is Anorexia Nervosa, Binge-Eating/Purging Type, with Restricting Type as a secondary consideration depending on whether binge episodes are confirmed. Anorexia Nervosa, Restricting Type (F50.01) if the clinical picture centers on restriction without purging. Atypical anorexia nervosa would fall under Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (F50.89) if weight doesn't meet full criteria. Bulimia Nervosa (F50.2) remains on the differential despite the absence of documented binge episodes, while Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (F50.82) seems less probable given the apparent preoccupation with weight and shape.","1.

99,"Ursula Norman, a 32-year-old nurse, was brought to an emergency department 6 days after giving birth. Her husband stated that she had been behaving very strangely and that she had become convinced that she had smothered and killed her baby.
 
 Her husband reported that after a normal pregnancy and uncomplicated delivery, Ms. Norman had happily gone home with their first child. On the third day after delivery, however, her mood and affect began to shift rapidly between elation and weepiness. She became irritable and anxious. She slept only an hour a night, even when her baby was asleep. Her behavior became increasingly bizarre, with overactivity and agitation. Her speech was rapid and digressive. Although not previously a religious person, she became convinced that God was speaking through her and that she had special powers that could solve the problems of the world. She told her husband that she could identify evil people by looking into their eyes and had begun to worry that she was surrounded by evil people, including her own mother. Most disturbing for her, whenever she was out of sight of her son, she became totally convinced that she had smothered him, and no one could convince her otherwise.
 
 Ms. Norman had a history of three episodes of major depressive disorder in her teens and early 20s. These episodes resolved with psychotherapy and antidepressant medication. She also had a psychiatric admission for mania 3 years prior to the delivery of her child, after a flight from Asia to Europe. Following treatment with antipsychotic medication, she became depressed for several months. Although a diagnosis of bipolar disorder was discussed at this time, she was reluctant to accept this label, attributing the episode to stress and jet lag. She had discontinued the psychiatric medication in anticipation of getting pregnant.
 
 Ms. Norman’s own mother had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital shortly after the birth of her first child. This episode was not talked about in the family, and there were few other details. She had no other family history of note.
 
 Until just before delivery of her child, Ms. Norman had been a highly functional nurse in a renal unit. Her husband was the head of a sales team, and they lived in comfortable social circumstances. She had no history of illicit drug use and, prior to pregnancy, drank only 2 or 3 units of alcohol a week.
 
 On mental status examination, Ms. Norman wandered around the room, seemingly unable to sit for more than a few moments. She was distractible and overtalkative, and demonstrated flight of ideas, flitting from one subject to another. Her mood was labile. At times she appeared happily euphoric. At other times she was tearful, and she could become quickly irritable when she felt she was not being understood. It was clear that she had a number of delusional beliefs but was unwilling to discuss most of them with the examiner. She did insist that she had already killed her own child, which led to several minutes of tears, but she returned to an edgy euphoria within a few minutes. She denied intent to harm herself or anyone else. She appeared inattentive, with poor concentration, but would not participate in formal cognitive testing.

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

The clinical presentation strongly suggests Bipolar I Disorder with peripartum onset. The manic episode is evident through markedly decreased sleep need, pressured speech, flight of ideas, grandiosity, and increased goal-directed activity alongside clear psychotic features including grandiose delusions about divine communication and special abilities, as well as paranoid ideation.

The mood-incongruent delusion regarding harming her infant, combined with her documented manic episode requiring hospitalization three years prior and subsequent depressive episodes, establishes a bipolar pattern. The symptom onset within weeks of delivery and her mother's postpartum psychiatric hospitalization further support this diagnosis with peripartum specifier.

Brief Psychotic Disorder is less likely given her established bipolar history. Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type remains in the differential but is less consistent with her presentation and prior course. irritable):
   - Decreased need for sleep ✓
   - More talkative/pressured speech ✓
   - Flight of ideas ✓
   - Distractibility ✓
   - Increased goal-directed activity/agitation ✓
   - Grandiosity ✓

Plus psychotic features (delusions)

Given prior manic episode and depressive episodes, this is Bipolar I Disorder.

She clearly meets criteria for a manic episode with all the hallmark features present—reduced sleep, racing thoughts, increased talkativeness, and heightened goal-directed behavior. The delusions represent psychotic features occurring within the mood episode. Combined with her history of prior mood episodes, the diagnosis is Bipolar I Disorder, Current Episode Manic, Severe, with Psychotic Features, with Peripartum Onset. Anxiety symptoms are likely secondary to the manic presentation, though they could warrant separate consideration if they persist.

For differential diagnoses, Brief Psychotic Disorder with Peripartum Onset should be considered given the psychotic features and timing, though the clear mood disturbance makes this less likely. Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type, is another consideration if mood symptoms don't fully account for the psychotic presentation. Her prior depressive episodes would be documented as part of her bipolar history rather than as a separate current diagnosis. The anxiety appears to be secondary to the manic presentation rather than a primary disorder. Substance use and personality pathology don't seem to be significant factors here.

Given the mood instability and rapid state shifts, the most likely primary diagnosis is Bipolar I Disorder, Current Episode Manic, Severe, with Psychotic Features (F31.2). The differential includes Brief Psychotic Disorder (F23), Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type (F25.0), and Schizophreniform Disorder (F20.81), though these are less consistent with the prominent affective symptoms driving the presentation.","1.

23,"A 16-year-old boy with no history of psychiatric illness in self or family and no psychoactive substance use presented with a seizure disorder of 5 years' duration. The semiology of the seizure was such that there would be an aura-tingling sensation in limbs, ringing in ears, and fearfulness for less than a minute, followed by focal onset seizure-twisting of the upper limb and head toward left with stiffening and jerky movements of all four limbs with unconsciousness associated with tongue bite, injury due to fall and episodes also occurred during sleep. He would be confused for a few minutes after gaining consciousness, complain of headaches, and would sleep at times. He had stopped going to school for 4 years and would refuse to visit his relatives because of fear of a seizure episode. He was treated with sodium valproate up to 800 mg for a year, 2 years back with irregular follow-ups. As a few episodes of seizure occurred in-between, the family opted for treatment from traditional healers instead of medicine, and he had been noncompliant for a year. For the last 4 months, the frequency had increased to 1–3 episodes within a day.
 
 A detailed clinical evaluation was done, and he was diagnosed as a case of focal onset generalized tonic–clonic seizure and advised for baseline blood investigations, EEG, and MRI and was restarted on sodium valproate 300 mg BD with the view of using an adequate dose and optimized to 900 mg in a week. The general physical and systemic examination, blood parameters, and MRI brain were normal. EEG showed slow background activity with sharp and spike-wave complexes in both cerebral hemispheres.
 
 After optimizing the dose of valproate, he was seizure-free for 6 days. However, he presented to the emergency department with drowsiness, decreased alertness, lethargy, and drooling of saliva with a serum valproate level of 76 mg/L. In view of the sedating side effect of sodium valproate, the antiepileptic was changed to tablet LEV 500 mg BD. The drowsiness improved after stopping valproate and starting LEV. On the 2nd day, he started saying that he felt like going crazy. On the fourth day, he was restless, agitated, and tried to run away from the ward with delusion of persecution and auditory hallucination, second person voices commenting.

- Social avoidance (refuses to visit relatives due to fear of seizure)

**Treatment History:**
- Sodium valproate up to 800 mg for 1 year, 2 years ago
- Irregular follow-ups
- Family switched to traditional healers
- Non-compliant for 1 year
- Recent escalation: 1-3 seizures/day for 4 months

**Current Presentation:**
1. Restarted on sodium valproate 300 mg BD, optimized to 900 mg
2. Investigations: Normal physical exam, blood parameters, MRI brain
3. EEG: Slow background activity with sharp and spike-wave complexes in both cerebral hemispheres
4. Seizure-free for 6 days after optimization

**Adverse Event Timeline:**
- Day 0: Presented to ED with drowsiness, decreased alertness, lethargy, drooling (serum valproate 76 mg/L - within therapeutic range)
- Valproate stopped, switched to Levetiracetam (LEV) 500 mg BD
- Drowsiness improved


- Day 2 on LEV: Reports feeling like ""going crazy""
- Day 4 on LEV: Becomes restless and agitated, attempts to flee, develops persecutory delusions and second-person auditory hallucinations (voices commenting on his actions)
- BPRS score: 34 (marked suspiciousness, hostility, resistance to cooperation)

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

**Primary Consideration - Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder:**
The temporal sequence is compelling: no baseline psychiatric illness, then psychotic features emerge shortly after LEV initiation. Levetiracetam carries well-established risk for psychiatric complications including psychosis, particularly in adolescents.

**Differential Diagnosis:**

1. **Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder (LEV-induced)**
   - The temporal relationship strongly supports this diagnosis
   - Symptoms began day 2 and progressed by day 4 of treatment
   - Coding considerations: F19.959 (Other psychoactive substance-induced psychotic disorder) applies since this is a prescribed medication rather than substance abuse
   - Alternative coding: F19.159 if documenting as abuse-related, though this case involves therapeutic use

2. **Postictal Psychosis:**
   - Can develop following seizure clusters or status epilepticus, typically within a week
   - This patient had been seizure-free for 6 days before psychiatric symptoms appeared, making this less likely
   - The temporal correlation with LEV initiation rather than seizure activity argues against this etiology

3. **Interictal Psychosis of Epilepsy:**
   - Represents chronic psychosis independent of seizure timing
   - The acute presentation and clear temporal relationship to medication initiation make this less probable

4. **Brief Psychotic Disorder:**
   - Symptoms lasting more than a day but under a month with acute onset
   - Would require ruling out substance or medication causation first

5. **Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder:**
   - Potential consideration if psychotic features persist after LEV discontinuation

6. **Delirium:**
   - Patient initially experienced drowsiness and lethargy on valproate, which improved after switching to LEV
   - The subsequent agitation and perceptual disturbances could suggest delirium, though the presentation appears more distinctly psychotic in nature

The most appropriate DSM-5-TR classification would be Other (or Unknown) Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder (F19.x59), given the clear temporal relationship between LEV initiation and psychotic symptom emergence, with LEV not fitting standard substance categories. d Psychotic Disorder with the appropriate code F19.959, since this involves a prescribed medication at therapeutic doses rather than a substance use disorder. The distinction matters—when medication causes psychosis without meeting criteria for use disorder, the coding reflects the medication-induced nature of the presentation. While F06.0 or F06.2 might apply if the psychosis were secondary to the underlying epilepsy itself, the clinical picture here points to medication as the primary culprit. Given DSM-5-TR guidelines, F19.XXX codes are most appropriate for medication-induced presentations that don't fit neatly into other substance categories.

The most likely diagnosis is levetiracetam-induced psychotic disorder (F19.959), supported by the clear timeline—symptoms emerged within days of starting the medication—combined with well-documented psychiatric side effects from this anticonvulsant and an absence of prior psychotic episodes. Alternative considerations include interictal psychosis related to the epilepsy itself (F06.2), though the temporal relationship to medication change makes this less probable. Brief psychotic disorder (F23) remains on the differential if medication and medical etiologies are ruled out, as does unspecified schizophrenia spectrum disorder (F29) if the clinical picture becomes less clear or symptoms persist beyond the expected timeframe.

The initial drowsiness and altered alertness could suggest delirium (F05), with subsequent agitation and perceptual disturbances potentially representing a hyperactive presentation. I should also account for the patient's four-year functional decline—avoiding school and social situations—though this appears driven by seizure-related anxiety rather than underlying psychiatric pathology. Forced normalization is worth considering, as the patient achieved seizure freedom for six days after valproate optimization before psychotic symptoms emerged, which aligns with this phenomenon where seizure control paradoxically triggers psychosis. However, this would still be conceptualized as either medication-induced psychosis or psychosis secondary to the epilepsy itself.

The differential diagnosis includes levetiracetam-induced psychotic disorder (F19.959), psychotic disorder due to epilepsy (F06.2), brief psychotic disorder (F23), medication-induced delirium (F05), and unspecified psychotic disorder (F29). The strongest evidence points to levetiracetam as the primary culprit given the clear temporal relationship with initiation, well-established psychiatric adverse effects of this medication, absence of prior psychiatric episodes, and the resolution of valproate's sedating effects before symptom onset. The most appropriate diagnosis is medication-induced psychotic disorder from levetiracetam, coded as F19.959. Alternative considerations include psychotic disorder due to a medical condition (F06.2), brief psychotic disorder (F23), delirium from another medical condition (F05), or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum disorder (F29) if the etiology remains unclear.","1.

1020,"Patient is a 24-year-old gender fluid individual with a BA in creative writing and sociology who is currently living with their parents while taking courses part-time and seeking employment. They describe their living situation as ""overwhelming"" due to parental boundary issues, though they maintain a supportive romantic relationship since 2019. Their psychiatric history includes diagnoses of MDD and GAD at age 15-16, PTSD in 2016 following emotional abuse by high school friends, and ADHD in 2018 (without neuropsychological evaluation). Current medications include Lisdexamfetamine 50mg (since 2018), various supplements, and a contraceptive injection. They previously tried multiple antidepressants (2011-2015) but discontinued each after approximately two weeks due to suicidal ideation and, in one case, motor disturbances. The patient consumes alcohol socially (3-5 drinks monthly) and has been vaping marijuana 1-3 times weekly for three months primarily to aid sleep and manage anxiety. The patient's primary symptoms onset around age 5 with intrusive visualizations of falling down stairs along with perfectionism through rewriting notes until they felt ""just right"". Currently, they experience significant distress when surroundings are not in the ""right spot"", spending up to 12 hours reorganizing belongings without breaks, which would cause severe distress if interrupted. This ""not just right"" feeling impairs their ability to meet deadlines, complete job applications, and fulfill social obligations. They also engage in checking behaviors when packing (counting socks repeatedly, checking for essential items) and experience distressing sexual intrusive thoughts. Additionally, the patient exhibits skin-picking behaviors, spending over an hour picking at ingrown hairs until bleeding, scratching their neck and jaw during conversations, and tearing at cuticles, with symptoms worsening during periods of anxiety. They've attempted to stop by wearing pants constantly but have been unsuccessful. The patient has a significant history of depression with three past suicide attempts (overdoses in 2014, 2015, and 2017) and self-injury through cutting (stopped in 2017). They currently experience passive suicidal ideation, anhedonia, decreased appetite, sleep difficulties, psychomotor agitation, feelings of worthlessness, and concentration problems, though they report 0% chance of self-harm in the next three months. Social anxiety manifests as persistent fear of judgment and rejection, with distressing rumination about social interactions and excessive reassurance-seeking that has cost them friendships. The patient also reported past sexual abuse by a boyfriend for 4-5 months but denied PTSD symptoms. They disclosed a history of binge eating episodes. During the binge, they ate more rapidly than normal and felt disgusted and embarrassed after. After these eating binges, pt fasted for ~3 days. These eating binges occurred <1 time per week, and the patient has not engaged in these behaviors in the past 2 months.","Let me carefully analyze this clinical case vignette to extract key information and develop a differential diagnosis.

1. **OCD-related symptoms (onset age 5):**
   - Intrusive visualizations of falling down stairs
   - Perfectionism - rewriting notes until ""just right""
   - ""Not just right"" feeling with surroundings
   - Spends up to 12 hours reorganizing belongings without breaks
   - Severe distress if interrupted
   - Checking behaviors when packing (counting socks, checking essentials)
   - Distressing sexual intrusive thoughts
   - Significant functional impairment (deadlines, job applications, social obligations)
   
2. **Body-focused repetitive behaviors:**
   - Skin-picking at ingrown hairs for extended periods, often until bleeding occurs
   - Scratching at neck and jaw during social interactions
   - Cuticle tearing
   - Escalates with heightened anxiety
   - Previous attempts to control through behavioral modification (wearing pants) proved ineffective
   - Associated with emotional distress and functional consequences

3. **Current depressive presentation:**
   - Passive suicidal ideation present
   - Loss of pleasure in activities
   - Reduced appetite
   - Sleep disturbance
   - Restlessness and agitation
   - Self-directed negative thoughts
   - Difficulty sustaining attention

History of three overdose attempts (2014, 2015, 2017) and prior self-harm through cutting that ceased in 2017. Currently reports minimal risk for self-harm over the next three months. Social anxiety manifests as persistent worry about being judged or rejected by others, with rumination about past interactions and frequent requests for reassurance that have strained relationships. Binge eating episodes occurred with rapid consumption followed by shame, sometimes followed by extended fasting periods, though these have not occurred in the past two months. ADHD was diagnosed in 2018 without formal neuropsychological testing and is currently being managed with medication. Picking at ingrown hairs until bleeding, scratching neck/jaw, tearing cuticles—behaviors lasting over an hour that cause significant distress. This represents a distinct diagnosis within the OCD spectrum.

Major depressive disorder is evident from passive suicidal ideation, anhedonia, appetite changes, sleep disruption, and feelings of worthlessness. The history of prior suicide attempts and initial diagnosis in adolescence suggests recurrent episodes. Current severity appears moderate to severe given the constellation of symptoms, pointing toward F33.1 or F33.2 depending on presence of psychotic features.

Social anxiety disorder manifests through persistent fear of judgment and rejection in social contexts.

Rumination about social interactions and excessive reassurance-seeking have resulted in measurable impairment—specifically the loss of friendships. Generalized anxiety disorder was previously diagnosed in adolescence with some ongoing symptoms present. ADHD was diagnosed in 2018 without formal neuropsychological testing, currently managed with Lisdexamfetamine, though the specific presentation type remains unclear. Eating patterns show binge episodes followed by compensatory fasting, but the frequency falls below the threshold needed for a formal bulimia nervosa diagnosis. - Obsessions and compulsions are the most functionally impairing symptoms, with intrusive thoughts and repetitive checking behaviors that consume significant time and energy. The ""not just right"" sensations are characteristic OCD presentations.

2. **Excoriation Disorder (F42.4)** - Distinct condition meeting full diagnostic criteria with documented distress and unsuccessful attempts at cessation.

3. **Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate (F33.1)** - Multiple current depressive symptoms present with a pattern of recurrent episodes including past suicide attempts. While passive suicidal ideation exists, the absence of active self-harm risk and moderate symptom severity support this classification over severe.

4. **Social Anxiety Disorder (F40.10)**

5. **Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (F90.x)** - Currently medicated but lacks formal diagnostic evaluation. Concentration difficulties may be partially attributable to depression and anxiety, though the patient is receiving treatment. Type specification would require more detailed information about presentation patterns, though unspecified (F90.9) or inattentive (F90.0) are possibilities.

Other considerations include binge eating with fasting patterns (currently in remission) and cannabis use, though neither has sufficient evidence of current impairment to warrant primary diagnosis.

Final diagnostic formulation:
1. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder - F42.2
2. Excoriation (Skin-Picking) Disorder - F42.4
3. Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate - F33.1
4. Social Anxiety Disorder - F40.10
5. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Unspecified Type - F90.9

The ADHD coding reflects the available information—stimulant treatment and concentration problems are documented, but the specific presentation subtype (inattentive, hyperactive/impulsive, or combined) cannot be determined from the clinical picture provided, making the unspecified code most appropriate.

Regarding the eating disorder symptoms: they've been in remission for two months and occurred at subthreshold frequency (less than once weekly), so a current diagnosis may not be warranted, though documenting this as historical or in early remission would be clinically relevant.

Let me verify the ICD-10 coding. OCD with both obsessions and compulsions maps to F42.2 (mixed obsessional thoughts and acts). For excoriation disorder, the primary code is L98.1 in dermatological classification, though DSM-5-TR mapping considerations apply here. , I need to select five diagnoses that map exclusively to F-codes. Let me identify the most clinically relevant conditions: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (F42.2), Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate (F33.1), Social Anxiety Disorder (F40.10), Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (F90.9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1) as an alternative given the documented anxiety history and current presentation. The eating disorder could also fit as Other Specified Feeding/Eating Disorder (F50.89), but the anxiety diagnoses seem more directly supported by the clinical picture. The eating patterns—binge eating followed by fasting—fall short of bulimia nervosa criteria since episodes occurred less than weekly and have been absent for two months, though they could warrant coding as F50.89 (Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder) if clinically significant. Regarding trauma history, while the patient experienced sexual abuse and emotional abuse in 2016, current PTSD symptoms aren't endorsed, so this doesn't warrant prioritization in the diagnostic formulation. Cannabis use at 1-3 times weekly for three months might suggest a use disorder if functional impairment is present, but the available information doesn't clearly establish this threshold.

The primary diagnoses are Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder (recurrent, moderate severity), Social Anxiety Disorder, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. These represent the core psychiatric conditions requiring treatment, with corresponding F-codes assigned accordingly.","1. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder - F42.2

85,"Felicia Allen was a 32-year-old single woman brought to the emergency room (ER) by police after she apparently tried to steal a city bus in Chicago. Because she appeared to be an “emotionally disturbed person,” a psychiatry consultation was requested.
 
 According to the police report, Ms. Allen threatened the driver with a knife, took control of the almost empty city bus, and crashed it. A more complete story was elicited from a friend of Ms. Allen’s who had been on the bus but who had not been arrested. According to her, they had boarded the bus on their way to a nearby shopping mall. Ms. Allen became frustrated when the driver refused her dollar bills, instead demanding exact change. She looked in her purse, but instead of finding exact change, she pulled out a kitchen knife that she carried for protection. The driver fled, so she got into the empty seat and drove the bus across the street into a nearby parked car.
 
 On examination, Ms. Allen was a handcuffed, heavyset young woman with a bandage on her forehead. She fidgeted and rocked back and forth in her chair. She appeared to be mumbling to herself. When asked what she was saying, the patient made momentary eye contact and just repeated, “Sorry, sorry.” She did not respond to other questions.
 
 More information was elicited from a psychiatrist who had come to the ER soon after the accident. He said that Ms. Allen and her friend were longtime residents at the state psychiatric hospital where he worked. They had just begun to take passes every week as part of an effort toward social remediation; it had been Ms. Allen’s first bus ride without a staff member.
 
 According to the psychiatrist, Ms. Allen had received a diagnosis of “childhood-onset, treatment-resistant paranoid schizophrenia.” She had started hearing voices by age 5 years. Big, strong, intrusive, and psychotic, she had been hospitalized almost constantly since age 11. Her auditory hallucinations generally consisted of a critical voice commenting on her behavior. Her thinking was concrete, but when relaxed she could be self-reflective. She was motivated to please and recurrently said her biggest goal was to “have my own room in my own house with my own friends.” The psychiatrist said that he was not sure what had caused her to pull out the knife. She had not been hallucinating lately and had been feeling less paranoid, but he wondered if she had been more psychotic than she had let on. It was possible that she was just impatient and irritated. The psychiatrist also believed that she had spent almost no period of life developing normally and so had very little experience with the real world.
 
 Ms. Allen had been taking clozapine for 1 year, with good resolution of her auditory hallucinations. She had gained 35 pounds on the clozapine, but she had less trouble getting out of bed in the morning and was functioning at a higher level. She was hoping to get a job and live more independently, and the bus trip had been intended as a step in that direction. Because of these improvements and goals, she had insisted on continuing to take the clozapine despite the weight gain.","Let me analyze this clinical case vignette carefully to extract relevant information and formulate a differential diagnosis.

**Data Extraction and Organization:**

Demographics:
- 32-year-old single woman
- Longtime resident at state psychiatric hospital

Presenting situation:
- Brought to ER by police after attempting to steal a city bus
- Threatened driver with knife, crashed bus into parked car
- Context: First bus ride without staff member as part of social remediation program

Mental Status Examination:
- Handcuffed, heavyset, bandage on forehead
- Fidgeting, rocking back and forth
- Appeared to be mumbling to herself
- Made momentary eye contact
- Repeated ""Sorry, sorry""
- Did not respond to other questions

Psychiatric History:
- Diagnosis: ""childhood-onset, treatment-resistant paranoid schizophrenia""
- Started hearing voices by age 5 years
- Hospitalized almost constantly since age 11
- Auditory hallucinations: critical voice commenting on her behavior
- Thinking described as concrete
- Can be self-reflective when relaxed
- Motivated to please
- Goal: ""have my own room in my own house with my own friends""
- Almost no period of normal development
- Very little experience with the real world

Current status per treating psychiatrist:
- Not hallucinating lately
- Feeling less paranoid
- Uncertainty about whether she was more psychotic than she let on
- Possible explanation: impatient and irritated

Medications:
- Clozapine for 1 year
- Good resolution of auditory hallucinations
- Side effect: 35-pound weight gain
- Improved functioning: less trouble getting out of bed, functioning at higher level
- Working toward job and independent living
- Chose to continue clozapine despite weight gain

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

1. **Primary Diagnosis: Schizophrenia**
The case clearly describes:
- Onset of auditory hallucinations at age 5 (childhood onset)


- Chronic course with near-continuous hospitalization since age 11
- Auditory hallucinations (critical voice commenting on behavior - this is a running commentary type)
- Paranoid features mentioned
- Treatment-resistant (required clozapine)
- Currently in partial remission on clozapine
- Duration clearly >6 months (over 20 years)
- Concrete thinking
- Impaired social/occupational functioning

The presentation fits schizophrenia across multiple domains. While she had paranoid features historically, DSM-5 no longer uses subtypes, so the diagnosis is simply Schizophrenia. Her current state shows symptom reduction on clozapine, though she remains functionally impaired and continues to struggle with independent living despite medication improvements.

For coding purposes, DSM-5-TR uses F20.9, whereas ICD-10-CM would specify F20.0 for the paranoid presentation. Beyond the primary diagnosis, her developmental history warrants attention—she had virtually no normal developmental period and demonstrates concrete thinking patterns. This raises questions about whether an intellectual developmental disorder or autism spectrum disorder might also be present, though neither has been formally assessed or documented in the case. and showing partial response to clozapine. The concrete thinking and limited real-world knowledge could reflect either intellectual disability or the effects of prolonged institutionalization alongside her psychotic illness. Autism spectrum disorder remains possible given her early-onset presentation with reduced eye contact and repetitive movements, though these features could alternatively stem from her chronic psychiatric condition and institutional environment. Schizoaffective disorder lacks supporting evidence since no distinct mood episodes are documented. Medical causes for psychosis have been ruled out based on the clinical picture. The most parsimonious explanation centers on schizophrenia as the primary diagnosis, with intellectual disability and autism as secondary considerations that may or may not represent independent conditions. The presentation with limited responsiveness, mumbling, and repetitive behavior suggests catatonic features may be present alongside the schizophrenia diagnosis. The fidgeting, rocking, limited eye contact, and repetitive utterances (""Sorry, sorry"") could indicate posturing, stereotypy, and echolalia. Given the established 20-year history of schizophrenia with documented hallucinations, paranoia, and clozapine dependence, this remains the primary diagnosis. Intellectual developmental disorder appears likely as a secondary condition, with catatonia potentially representing a specifier rather than a separate diagnosis. Disorder** - Could reflect early behavioral disturbances, though documentation is limited. **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder** might also apply given the prolonged institutionalization.

The weight gain from clozapine represents a metabolic side effect rather than a primary psychiatric diagnosis. Rocking movements could indicate tardive dyskinesia or akathisia, though these fall outside F-code classifications.

Ultimately, schizophrenia remains the primary diagnosis with possible comorbid mild intellectual disability and anxiety disorder, while autism spectrum disorder warrants consideration given early symptom onset and social deficits, though these features overlap significantly with his established psychotic illness. F25.9 (Rule out, though no clear mood episodes described). The primary diagnosis remains schizophrenia given the chronic hallucinations, paranoia, and early childhood onset with clozapine response. Mild intellectual disability warrants consideration due to concrete thinking patterns and functional limitations, though formal assessment isn't documented. Autism spectrum disorder is a differential given early symptom onset, limited eye contact, and motor stereotypies like rocking, though these features could stem from the chronic psychotic illness and prolonged institutionalization. Comorbid anxiety may also be present.","1. Schizophrenia - F20.9

1012,"Melanie is an 11 year old girl who was brought to urgent care by her mother after being sent home from school for “using racial slurs.” Melanie is the product of a full-term, uncomplicated pregnancy, vaginally delivered with normal APGAR (Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration) score at birth. Melanie used her first word “Momma” around 48 months of age, and didn’t start noticing other children playing with her until about 6 years old. Even at 6 years old, Melanie would not respond to her name when called, often appearing like she was in a daydream, and would often do a lot of “rocking” or “spinning” when anxious. Melanie’s mother indicates “Melanie is a unique kid. She doesn’t really make good eye contact with me, her father or her friends, and seems to be overly focused on doing puzzles all day. She has a hard time making friends, because all she wants to do is work on puzzles, and does little interactive play with others.” Melanies mother also indicates “if we take her puzzle away from her for dinner, she will have a complete ‘meltdown’ and be inconsolable for a good hour, ultimately leading to us having to give her the puzzle back.” Around 8 years of age, Melanie was found blinking her eyes repeatedly, and would say “I have to do it” whenever family questioned the eye blinking. The eye blinking slowly went away, but seemed to be replace by Melanie contorting her neck repeatedly, and especially when getting ready for school or leaving the house. Now, Melanie slaps herself in the head repeatedly when stressed, to the point that family has to adorn Melanie with soft gloves so she does not cause injury. About 13 months ago, Melanie start screaming out racial slurs when in the grocery store and school, and this would last for about 5 minutes in duration, until she was able to calm down. Otherwise, Melanie denied problems with sad, depressed or hopeless mood, nor problems with auditory or visual hallucinations. Melanies mother denied observations of bizarre rituals such as excessive handwashing, counting or organizing, but does report Melanie has a strong and persistent interest in puzzles. Melanie denied active thoughts, plans or intents of harm to self or others.","Let me carefully analyze this clinical case vignette to formulate an accurate differential diagnosis.

**Data Extraction and Organization:**

**Demographic Information:**
- 11-year-old girl
- Brought to urgent care after being sent home from school for ""using racial slurs""

**Developmental History:**
- Full-term, uncomplicated pregnancy
- Vaginal delivery with normal APGAR scores
- First word ""Momma"" at approximately 48 months (significantly delayed - typical is 12-18 months)
- Didn't start noticing other children until about 6 years old
- At 6 years old: would not respond to her name when called, appeared to be in a daydream
- ""Rocking"" or ""spinning"" when anxious (stereotyped motor movements)

**Current Presentation and Behavioral Observations:**
- Poor eye contact with parents and friends
- Restricted, fixated interest in puzzles (""overly focused on doing puzzles all day"")
- Difficulty making friends due to preoccupation with puzzles
- Little interactive play with others
- ""Meltdowns"" when puzzle is taken away - inconsolable for an hour (difficulty with transitions, insistence on sameness)

**Movement/Tic History:**
- Around age 8: repeated eye blinking - reports ""I have to do it"" (motor tic - simple)
- Eye blinking replaced by neck contorting (motor tic - complex), especially when getting ready for school or leaving the house
- Currently: slaps self in head repeatedly when stressed (could be complex motor tic or self-injurious behavior related to ASD)
- Family has to use soft gloves to prevent injury

**Vocal Symptoms:**
- About 13 months ago: started screaming out racial slurs in grocery store and school
- Episodes last about 5 minutes until she calms down
- This is coprolalia - involuntary utterance of obscene words/socially inappropriate remarks


- No reported sadness, depression, or hopelessness; denies hallucinations. Mother confirms absence of compulsive rituals like excessive handwashing or counting. No active suicidal or homicidal ideation.

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

The developmental trajectory points strongly toward autism spectrum disorder. Marked language delay with first words emerging at 4 years, combined with early social withdrawal and failure to respond to her name, establishes significant communication deficits. The restricted interests centered on puzzles and the rigid behavioral patterns—including distress with transitions and need for sameness—align with core autism features. Motor stereotypies like rocking and spinning further support this diagnosis.

Tourette's disorder also warrants serious consideration given the tic history. Motor tics began at age 8 with eye blinking, progressed to neck contortions, and currently manifest as head slapping. Vocal tics including coprolalia emerged within the past year. The duration and age of onset meet diagnostic criteria, and coprolalia, while uncommon, strongly suggests Tourette's when present alongside other tics. d be a stress response rather than a true compulsion. The waxing and waning pattern and premonitory urge support the tic interpretation.

**Diagnostic Formulation:**

Primary diagnosis is Autism Spectrum Disorder with comorbid Tourette's Disorder. The autism presents with early language delay, social difficulties, and restricted interests in puzzles. The Tourette's manifests through multiple motor tics (eye blinking, neck contorting, head slapping) and vocal tics (coprolalia), with clear onset at age 8 and waxing/waning course. Intellectual disability may be present given the significant language delay but cannot be confirmed without formal testing. OCD is ruled out since the mother denies true obsessions and the puzzle preoccupation aligns better with autistic restricted interests. The head slapping appears to function as a complex motor tic rather than self-injury, supported by its relationship to the tic cycle and premonitory sensations. the ""daydreaming"" could represent inattention, though there's insufficient data to confirm ADHD.

The primary diagnosis is Autism Spectrum Disorder, supported by clear social communication deficits and restricted repetitive behaviors evident since early development. Tourette's Disorder is also present, with multiple motor tics including eye blinking and neck contorting, plus vocal tics with coprolalia, meeting duration and age-of-onset criteria. The significant language delay suggests possible intellectual disability requiring formal IQ testing to determine severity. Stereotypic Movement Disorder with self-injurious behavior may apply, though the movements are likely better explained by the ASD and Tourette's diagnoses.

The head-slapping appears to function as a complex motor tic given its stress-related occurrence and premonitory quality, while rocking and spinning when anxious could represent either ASD stereotypies or self-soothing mechanisms. The coprolalia specifically warrants careful documentation as it's a key feature distinguishing Tourette's from other tic disorders.

For additional diagnoses, I'm weighing anxiety disorder against language disorder and stereotypic movement disorder. The anxiety symptoms (tics worsening with stress, rocking/spinning when anxious) suggest this could be relevant, though language delays might be better explained by the autism diagnosis itself. Stereotypic movement disorder would be redundant given the ASD and Tourette's diagnoses. Without sufficient ADHD indicators, I'll focus on the three primary diagnoses: Autism Spectrum Disorder, Tourette's Disorder, and Unspecified Intellectual Developmental Disorder, as these capture the core clinical presentation. The self-injurious behavior warrants separate documentation even alongside the ASD diagnosis when it requires clinical intervention. So the diagnostic picture includes Autism Spectrum Disorder as the primary condition, along with Tourette's Disorder, Unspecified Intellectual Developmental Disorder, and Unspecified Anxiety Disorder. The head-slapping behavior—occurring during stress and necessitating protective equipment—appears more consistent with self-injurious stereotypy tied to autism rather than a distinct movement disorder, though the distinction between complex motor tics and stress-related self-injury needs careful consideration. Unspecified Intellectual Developmental Disorder (F79), Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9), and Stereotypic Movement Disorder with self-injurious behavior (F98.4) round out the diagnosis. Though the stereotypic movements could be attributed to autism alone, the self-injurious behavior is severe enough to warrant its own diagnostic attention. Language delay is the primary indicator of intellectual disability, though it's not conclusive on its own.

For the differential diagnosis, I'd list Autism Spectrum Disorder as the primary condition, with Tourette's Disorder, possible intellectual disability, stereotypic movement disorder with self-injury, and anxiety as secondary considerations.

178,"Nate Irvin was a 31-year-old single white man who sought outpatient psychiatric services for “lack of self-confidence.” He reported lifelong troubles with assertiveness and was specifically upset by having been “stuck” for 2 years at his current “dead-end” job as an administrative assistant. He wished someone would tell him where to go next so that he would not have to face the “burden” of decision. At work, he found it easy to follow his boss’s directions but had difficulty making even minor independent decisions. The situation was “depressing,” he said, but nothing new.
 
 Mr. Irvin also reported dissatisfaction with his relationships with women. He described a series of several-month-long relationships over the prior 10 years that ended despite his doing “everything I could” and “never getting angry or yelling.” His most recent relationship had been with an opera singer. He reported having gone to several operas and taken singing classes to impress her, even though he did not particularly enjoy music. That relationship had recently ended for unclear reasons. He said his mood and self-confidence were tied to his dating. Being single made him feel desperate, but desperation made it even harder to get a girlfriend. He said he felt trapped by that spiral. Since the latest breakup, he had been quite sad, with frequent crying spells. It was this depression that had prompted him to seek treatment. He denied all other symptoms of depression, including problems with sleep, appetite, energy, suicidality, and ability to enjoy things.
 
 Mr. Irvin initially denied taking any medications, but he eventually revealed that 1 year earlier his primary care physician had begun to prescribe alprazolam 0.5 mg/day for “anxiety.” His dose had escalated, and at the time of the evaluation, Mr. Irvin was taking 5 mg/day and getting prescriptions from three different physicians. Cutting back led to anxiety and “the shakes.”
 
 Mr. Irvin denied any prior personal or family psychiatric history, including outpatient psychiatric appointments.
 
 After hearing this history, the psychiatrist was concerned about Mr. Irvin’s escalating alprazolam use and his chronic difficulties with independence. She thought the most accurate diagnosis was benzodiazepine use disorder comorbid with a personality disorder. However, she was concerned about the negative unintended effects that these diagnoses might have on the patient, including his employment and insurance coverage, as well as how he would be dealt with by future clinicians. She typed into the electronic medical record a diagnosis of “adjustment disorder with depressed mood.” Two weeks later, Mr. Irvin’s insurance company asked her for his diagnosis, and she gave the same diagnosis.","Let me carefully analyze this clinical case vignette to provide an accurate diagnosis.

Key clinical information extracted:

1. Demographics: 31-year-old single white man

2. Chief complaint: ""lack of self-confidence""

3. Presenting symptoms and history:
- Lifelong troubles with assertiveness
- Difficulty making independent decisions at work
- Wants someone to tell him where to go (avoids responsibility for decisions)
- Easily follows boss's directions but struggles with minor independent decisions
- ""Stuck"" for 2 years at current job - feels it's a ""dead-end""
- Describes situation as ""depressing"" but ""nothing new""

4. Relationship pattern:
- Series of several-month-long relationships over 10 years that ended
- Does ""everything I could"" and ""never getting angry or yelling"" - excessive need to please
- Took singing classes and went to operas to impress girlfriend despite not enjoying music (going to excessive lengths to gain support)
- Mood and self-confidence tied to dating
- Feels desperate when single
- Recent breakup causing sadness with frequent crying spells
- This depression prompted treatment seeking

5. Depressive symptoms:
- Sad mood, frequent crying spells since breakup
- Denies other depression symptoms: sleep, appetite, energy, suicidality, anhedonia are NOT affected

6. Substance use:
- Alprazolam: Started 1 year ago at 0.5 mg/day for ""anxiety""
- Current dose: 5 mg/day (significant escalation)
- Getting prescriptions from THREE different physicians (doctor shopping)
- Cutting back leads to anxiety and ""the shakes"" (withdrawal symptoms)

7. Family/personal psychiatric history: Denies any

Diagnostic formulation:

1. **Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder** (Benzodiazepine Use Disorder):
- Tolerance (escalated from 0.5 mg to 5 mg/day)


- Withdrawal symptoms when cutting back (anxiety, ""the shakes"")
- Obtaining from multiple physicians (doctor shopping behavior)
- Taking in larger amounts than intended (dose escalation)
This appears to be moderate to severe given the criteria met.
ICD-10: F13.20 (moderate) or F13.10 (mild) - likely F13.20 given severity

2. **Dependent Personality Disorder (F60.7)**:
- Difficulty making everyday decisions without excessive advice/reassurance from others
- Needs others to assume responsibility for major areas of life (wants someone to tell him where to go)
- Has difficulty expressing disagreement with others due to fear of loss of support or approval
- Urgently seeks another relationship or source of support when one ends (feels desperate when single)
- Unrealistic preoccupation with being abandoned
- Willingness to do unpleasant things to maintain relationships (took singing classes and opera despite disliking music)
- Pervasive pattern of dependent and submissive behavior

The benzodiazepine dependence is the acute clinical concern requiring immediate intervention, while the personality disorder represents a longstanding maladaptive pattern underlying his anxiety and relationship difficulties. His current depression appears situational (tied to the breakup) rather than a primary mood disorder, given the absence of neurovegetative symptoms and the clear precipitant. 1**:
- He says the situation is ""depressing"" but ""nothing new""
- Chronic low mood
- However, he denies typical depressive symptoms, so this may not fit well

5. **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1)**:
- Initially prescribed alprazolam for ""anxiety""
- However, limited information about anxiety symptoms beyond what's described

6. **Other specified depressive disorder (F32.89)** - if the depressive symptoms don't meet full criteria

Top 5 diagnoses:

1. **Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder, Moderate to Severe** - F13.20
- Most acute and clinically significant given the doctor shopping, dose escalation, and withdrawal symptoms

2. **Dependent Personality Disorder** - F60.7
- Lifelong pattern meeting multiple criteria (difficulty

He describes his current state as depressing yet familiar, with a persistent underlying sadness that doesn't align with classic depression presentations. The anxiety diagnosis rests primarily on his initial alprazolam prescription, though concrete anxiety symptoms remain unclear. The substance use disorder stands out as the most pressing concern—his pattern of seeking multiple prescribers, increasing doses, and experiencing withdrawal effects indicates a moderate to severe problem. His long-standing reliance on others and difficulty functioning independently point toward dependent personality features as a core issue. standing. The benzodiazepine use disorder shows clear signs of dependence—tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, and doctor shopping indicate loss of control over use. Both conditions warrant diagnosis, though the substance use disorder demands immediate clinical attention due to withdrawal risks, while the personality pathology represents the deeper vulnerability. The sedative dependence is coded as F13.20 given the presence of physiological dependence, and the dependent personality disorder as F60.7 completes the clinical picture.

Additional diagnoses to consider include adjustment disorder with depressed mood and anxiety disorder, though these may be secondary to the primary conditions. The benzodiazepine dependence severity aligns with moderate-to-severe presentation based on the escalating use pattern and withdrawal manifestations.

Regarding dysthymia, the clinical picture doesn't quite fit—while he describes his circumstances as depressing, he denies persistent depressive symptoms beyond the sadness tied to his recent breakup. His chronic difficulties appear rooted more in personality pathology than a primary mood disturbance, so persistent depressive disorder isn't warranted here.

The core diagnostic picture centers on the substance use disorder and dependent personality structure, with the adjustment disorder capturing the acute stressor response.

For the anxiety component, his initial alprazolam prescription suggests clinically significant anxiety warranting documentation, though the specific presentation remains unclear. However, much of what presents as anxiety may actually reflect the dependent personality features—fear of abandonment, difficulty with autonomous decision-making. Including both an anxiety disorder and dependent personality disorder risks redundancy if the anxiety is primarily a manifestation of the personality pathology rather than a distinct condition. Still, given the documented history of anxiety symptoms prompting medication, listing unspecified anxiety disorder provides appropriate diagnostic coverage.

The chronic dissatisfaction and sense of being stuck suggest considering persistent depressive disorder alongside the adjustment disorder, as the depressive features may extend beyond a situational response. The final diagnostic formulation includes the substance use disorder as primary, the personality disorder as foundational, the adjustment disorder for the acute mood disturbance, unspecified anxiety disorder for the anxiety symptoms, and persistent depressive disorder to capture the longer-standing depressive pattern.","1.

1047,"Patient F is a 37 year old male with past medical history of hypertension and past psychiatric history of substance use disorder (marijuana, methamphetamine) and psychosis who presents after being brought in by police to the ED for aggression. The patient was reportedly at a gas station causing a disturbance, speaking about how everyone in there was the devil and throwing items off the shelves. When officers arrived, the patient was aggressive and had to be tased. On arrival, the patient had to receive emergency IM medications of Haldol, Ativan, and Benadryl due to agitation. Psychiatry was consulted for psychosis. On psychiatric assessment, the patient is drowsy after having just received the emergency IM medications. However, he is irritable and hostile, telling the physician to “fuck off” and that “the devil is out to get you”. He states he is “like a God” and that he was unfairly arrested. On chart review, he has a history of being prescribed antipsychotics, but currently pt denies taking any psychiatric medications. Assessment was limited due to the patient’s lack of engagement and hostility. Lab work was significant for UDS positive for marijuana, methamphetamine, and PCP. He started on a low-dose of scheduled Risperidone. The next day, he was reassessed by psychiatry. He is less hostile, but still irritable and asks if he can sleep. On limited assessment, pt denied thinking the devil was after him and did not make any grandiose statements about him being God. He did not appear internally preoccupied but was very sleepy. He was later assessed in the afternoon after he was repotedly asking to leave. He denied suicidal ideations, homicidal ideations, or auditory/visual hallucinations. While he was still irritable, he was more cooperative and states he does not recall being at a gas station. He does endorse to using marijuana, methamphetamine, and PCP “for 2 days straight”. He is currently homeless and wants to go to the shelter. He denies paranoia or any belief that he is God, states “that’s ridiculous” when asked that question. Patient was then discharged after spending 24 hours in the ED.","Let me analyze this clinical case vignette carefully.

**Key Clinical Information:**

Demographics: 37-year-old male

Past Medical History: Hypertension

Past Psychiatric History: 
- Substance use disorder (marijuana, methamphetamine)
- Psychosis (unclear if primary or substance-induced)

Presentation:
- Brought by police for aggression at gas station
- Paranoid delusions (""everyone in there was the devil"")
- Aggressive behavior (throwing items, had to be tased)
- Required emergency IM medications (Haldol, Ativan, Benadryl)

Mental Status on Initial Assessment:
- Drowsy (post-medication)
- Irritable and hostile
- Paranoid ideation (""the devil is out to get you"")
- Grandiose delusions (""like a God"")
- Felt unfairly arrested
- Limited engagement

Lab Work:
- UDS positive for marijuana, methamphetamine, and PCP

Hospital Course:
- Started on low-dose scheduled Risperidone
- Day 2: Less hostile, still irritable, sleepy
- Denied paranoid ideation about devil
- No grandiose statements
- Not internally preoccupied
- Later that day: More cooperative
- Denied SI/HI, denied AH/VH
- No recall of gas station incident
- Admitted to using marijuana, methamphetamine, and PCP ""for 2 days straight""
- Currently homeless
- Denied paranoia and grandiose beliefs
- Discharged after 24 hours

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

1. **Phencyclidine (PCP) Intoxication with Perceptual Disturbances:**
The patient tested positive for PCP and presented with classic features of PCP intoxication including:
- Aggression/violence
- Paranoid delusions
- Grandiosity
- Hostility
- Amnesia for events during intoxication


The fact that his psychotic symptoms resolved completely within 24 hours points toward substance-induced psychosis rather than a primary psychiatric disorder. Methamphetamine exposure during the 2-day binge also likely contributed significantly—it's a well-known cause of paranoid delusions, grandiosity, and aggressive behavior. The patient's pattern of polysubstance use and positive UDS for multiple agents suggests ongoing substance use disorder requiring intervention. induced psychotic disorder with delusions. For PCP specifically, the code would be F16.959 for hallucinogen-induced psychotic disorder. The methamphetamine use disorder falls under F15 codes, with the severity depending on whether it meets mild or moderate/severe criteria based on the number of DSM-5 diagnostic criteria present.

Given this presentation, the primary diagnosis is the PCP-induced psychotic disorder since the psychosis resolved quickly once the substance was discontinued—a hallmark feature of substance-induced rather than primary psychotic disorders. The amphetamine use disorder appears moderate to severe based on the pattern of use, coded F15.20. The phencyclidine use disorder itself would be F16.20, and cannabis use disorder F12.20 should also be documented. A schizophrenia spectrum disorder remains on the differential but is less likely given the rapid resolution with abstinence. Also likely contributing given methamphetamine is known to cause psychosis. The substance use disorders themselves warrant coding: PCP use disorder (F16.20 for moderate/severe), methamphetamine use disorder (F15.20), and cannabis use disorder (F12.20). I need to be precise with the ICD-10 coding—PCP falls under ""Other Hallucinogen"" in DSM-5-TR, so the appropriate codes would be F16.20 for moderate/severe hallucinogen use disorder, with additional specificity for intoxication presentations if needed. Adding an unspecified psychotic disorder diagnosis (F29) to account for the documented history of psychosis, though the current episode appears substance-induced. I'm reconsidering the primary substance responsible for the psychotic presentation—both PCP and methamphetamine are potent psychotomimetics. PCP typically causes acute paranoia, aggression, and grandiosity with faster resolution, while methamphetamine-induced psychosis tends to persist longer after use stops. The 24-hour symptom resolution here actually points more toward PCP as the primary driver rather than methamphetamine.

The substance-induced psychotic disorder should be the primary diagnosis, with the polysubstance use disorders listed secondarily. Since the patient tested positive for multiple substances, I need to weigh whether to include both PCP-induced and stimulant-induced psychotic disorders, or prioritize based on the clinical timeline and presentation pattern. moderate to severe - F15.20
3. Phencyclidine use disorder - F16.20
4. Cannabis use disorder - F12.20

Since the psychosis appears entirely substance-related rather than a primary disorder, I should avoid listing an unspecified schizophrenia spectrum diagnosis. Instead, I'll include the stimulant-induced psychotic disorder to capture methamphetamine's likely role alongside the PCP component. The final diagnostic picture centers on the two substance-induced psychotic presentations with their corresponding use disorders. yclidine-induced psychotic disorder - F16.959

The substance use disorders need to be documented separately: methamphetamine dependence at moderate to severe level, phencyclidine use disorder, and cannabis use disorder. Given the history of prior psychotic episodes, I should also include an unspecified schizophrenia spectrum disorder as a differential diagnosis to account for the possibility of an underlying primary psychotic condition rather than purely substance-induced symptoms.","1.

17,"A 39-year-old Caucasian male presented to inpatient psychiatry after initially presenting to the emergency department with psychosis. He had been found crawling in a parking lot with several feet of intestines dragging on the ground. The patient was only responding internally during the examination, and a urine drug screen was positive only for cannabis. He received an emergent exploratory laparotomy with a partial colectomy. He stabilized medically but became briefly catatonic on day six of hospitalization, which was resolved with intravenous diazepam. On day seven, he was transferred to the inpatient psychiatry unit on a voluntary basis.
 
 On admission to inpatient psychiatry, the patient was fully oriented and able to recall stabbing himself in the abdomen because characters in his mind told him to, having an out-of-body experience as he watched himself pull out several feet of intestines. He felt compelled to follow the voices' commands because he had guilt about his history of sexual abuse towards women. He then recalls running out of his apartment and waking up in the hospital. He endorsed paranoia and auditory hallucinations for the last 10 years but never sought treatment. He felt hopeless, yet believed his potential was infinite. He had no suicidal ideation and expressed a fear of hurting himself upon returning home if the voices persisted.
 
 He had never been diagnosed with a psychiatric illness or received treatment, but he did see a psychiatrist at age 17 after he was charged with indecent exposure. He recalled periods in his life when he had little need for sleep, had racing thoughts, and felt that signs and advertisements were speaking directly to him. His social history was notable for heavy cannabis use beginning at age 18. He was a daily user for 5-6 years and began experiencing paranoia and auditory hallucinations. Despite quitting for two years, the psychotic symptoms persisted, and he reported currently using cannabis 3-4 days per week. He also had a history of trauma and was emotionally and physically abused by his father who had alcohol use disorder.
 
 On a physical exam, the patient had normal speech and appearance, an expansive affect, and poor insight. He endorsed auditory hallucinations of male voices that were commanding and feelings of paranoia.","Let me carefully analyze this clinical vignette to develop an accurate differential diagnosis.

**Key Clinical Information:**

Demographics:
- 39-year-old Caucasian male

Presenting Problem:
- Found crawling in parking lot with intestines dragging (self-evisceration)
- Psychosis on presentation
- Positive UDS for cannabis only
- Brief catatonia on day 6, resolved with IV diazepam

Psychiatric History:
- Command auditory hallucinations telling him to harm himself
- Out-of-body experience during self-harm
- Paranoia and auditory hallucinations for 10 years (chronic)
- Never formally diagnosed or treated
- Saw psychiatrist at age 17 after indecent exposure charge
- Reports past episodes with:
  - Little need for sleep
  - Racing thoughts
  - Ideas of reference (signs and advertisements speaking to him)
- Currently: hopeless yet believes potential is infinite (grandiosity vs. mixed states)
- No current suicidal ideation but fear of self-harm if voices persist
- Poor insight

Substance Use:
- Heavy cannabis use starting at age 18
- Daily user for 5-6 years
- Paranoia and auditory hallucinations began during heavy use
- Quit for 2 years - psychotic symptoms PERSISTED
- Currently using cannabis 3-4 days/week

Trauma History:
- Emotional and physical abuse by father (who had AUD)
- History of sexual abuse towards women (perpetrator)

Mental Status Exam:
- Fully oriented
- Normal speech and appearance
- Expansive affect
- Poor insight
- Active auditory hallucinations (command type, male voices)
- Paranoia

**Differential Diagnosis Analysis:**

1. **Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type** - The patient has:
   - Chronic psychotic symptoms (10 years) - auditory hallucinations, paranoia
   - Distinct mood episodes featuring manic characteristics (reduced sleep need, flight of ideas, inflated self-regard)
   - Ideas of reference
   - The psychotic features persist even during euthymic periods (chronic paranoia and hallucinations spanning a decade)
   - Current expansive presentation
   - This diagnosis fits well given the sustained psychosis alongside clear affective dysregulation

2. **Schizophrenia** - Consider because:
   - Persistent auditory hallucinations spanning over a decade
   - Paranoid thinking
   - Ideas of reference
   - Diminished insight
   - Illness onset in late adolescence/early adulthood
   - However, the prominent manic features and mood-related symptoms make this less likely as a primary diagnosis

3. **Bipolar I Disorder with Psychotic Features** - Consider because:
   - Documented manic-type episodes (decreased need for sleep, pressured speech, grandiosity)
   - Currently displaying expansive mood
   - The chronic psychotic symptoms that emerged independent of mood states argue against this as the sole explanation

4. **Cannabis-Induced Psychotic Disorder** - Consider because:
   - Initiated heavy use at 18
   - Psychosis emerged during period of heavy consumption
   - Current positive cannabis screen
   - The persistence of symptoms during a 2-year period of abstinence suggests cannabis is not the primary driver, though it may be perpetuating an underlying disorder

5. **Cannabis Use Disorder** - Consider because: The patient demonstrates heavy daily use spanning 5-6 years, current use 3-4 days weekly despite negative consequences, and continued use despite active psychotic symptoms. This warrants a comorbid diagnosis.

6. **PTSD/Trauma-related** - Childhood abuse history present but insufficient data for formal PTSD diagnosis

7. **Unspecified Personality Disorder** - Behavioral history including indecent exposure and sexual aggression noted, though specifics remain unclear

**Primary Diagnosis Consideration:**

The clinical picture centers on a decade-plus of persistent psychotic symptoms alongside documented manic episodes with decreased sleep need, racing thoughts, and ideas of reference. The psychosis appears to operate independently from mood fluctuations, and current presentation shows expansive affect with symptom persistence even during periods of cannabis abstinence. **Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type (F25.0)** emerges as the primary diagnosis.

**Secondary Diagnoses:**

1. Cannabis Use Disorder - The pattern of heavy historical use with ongoing consumption despite psychotic symptoms suggests moderate to severe severity (F12.20), given the frequency and consequences.

2. Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder, Unspecified (F43.9) - accounting for childhood abuse history.

3. The catatonic episode warrants notation though typically coded with the primary disorder.

4. Schizophrenia, paranoid type no longer exists in DSM-5 diagnostic criteria.

Weighing the differential diagnoses: Schizophrenia (F20.9) versus Bipolar I with psychotic features (F31.2) versus Schizoaffective Disorder. The 10-year course of chronic psychotic symptoms combined with documented manic episodes and psychosis occurring independent of mood disturbance points most strongly toward Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type as the primary diagnosis. Cannabis Use Disorder, Moderate (F12.20) remains the secondary diagnosis given the exacerbating relationship with the primary psychotic disorder.

For the differential considerations: Schizophrenia would apply if mood episodes prove less central to the presentation; Bipolar I with psychotic features if psychotic symptoms emerge exclusively during manic periods; and Unspecified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder (F43.9) given the documented childhood abuse history.

Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder seems unlikely since the psychotic symptoms persisted throughout two years of complete abstinence, which rules out active substance intoxication as the primary driver. The sustained nature of the symptoms across extended sobriety points toward a primary psychotic or mood disorder rather than substance-induced etiology.

The brief catatonic features further support an underlying primary psychiatric condition, as catatonia in this context would be secondary to the main disorder rather than substance-related.","1. Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type - F25.0

Mom states that he has started doing the same at home as well, refusing to do his chores, arguing with her when she tells him to do his homework, and mocks her when she confronts him. She notes that in addition to refusal to do chores, he will intentionally create more chores to do, such as making messes and not cleaning them up.

When asked if there is anything in his life causing stress that may be causing him to ask out, he states, “yea, my mom.” He denies any depression or suicidal ideation.","Let me analyze this clinical case vignette carefully.

**Data Extraction and Organization:**

Demographics:
- 12-year-old male

Presenting Problem:
- Multiple detentions for behavior at school
- Brought by mother

Behavioral symptoms at school:
- Does not follow instructions in class
- Becomes argumentative with teachers
- Disrespectful behavior
- Uses profanities against teachers and staff

Behavioral symptoms at home:
- Same behaviors started at home
- Refuses to do chores
- Argues with mother when told to do homework
- Mocks mother when confronted
- Intentionally creates more chores (making messes and not cleaning up) - this suggests deliberately annoying/vindictive behavior

Mental Status Examination observations:
- Rolls eyes at evaluator
- Says ""none of your business"" - defiant response
- Kicks the desk - physical acting out
- Blames mother for stress

Denials:
- Denies depression
- Denies suicidal ideation

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

Primary consideration: Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD)
- Pattern of angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behavior
- Argues with authority figures (teachers, mother)
- Actively defies/refuses to comply with requests from authority figures
- Deliberately annoys others (making messes intentionally)
- Blames others for behavior (""my mom"")
- The behavior is present in at least two settings (school and home)
- Duration not specified but appears to be ongoing

DSM-5-TR criteria for ODD requires 4 of 8 symptoms for at least 6 months:
1. Often loses temper - not clearly specified
2. Often touchy or easily annoyed - possible (rolls eyes, kicks desk)
3. Often angry and resentful - not clearly stated
4. Often argues with authority figures - YES
5. Often actively defies or refuses to comply with requests/rules - YES


6. Often deliberately annoys others - YES (intentionally creates messes)
7. Often blames others for mistakes or misbehavior - YES (blames mom)
8. Has been spiteful or vindictive at least twice - possible

The pattern is present across settings (home and school).

Differential Diagnosis:

1. Conduct Disorder - need to rule out more serious violations like aggression to people/animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness/theft, serious rule violations. The case mentions disrespect and defiance but not the more severe behaviors typical of CD. The kicking the desk could suggest some aggression but it's relatively minor.

2. ADHD - while not the primary presentation, inattention and impulsivity could contribute to not following instructions and argumentative behavior. However, the deliberate nature of the annoying behaviors and the pattern of defiance suggests this is more about opposition than attention/impulse control issues. Would need to assess for ADHD symptoms more directly.

3. DMDD requires severe recurrent temper outbursts and a persistently irritable mood between episodes, but there's insufficient information about the child's baseline mood state to determine if this fits.

4. Adjustment Disorder with Conduct Disturbance could apply if a clear recent stressor exists, though the mention of ""mom"" as a stressor lacks specificity about timing or nature.

5. Unspecified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder may be appropriate if full criteria for ODD or CD aren't met.

6. Parent-Child Relational Problem - likely a contributing factor rather than a primary diagnosis.

Top 5 Diagnoses to consider: ODD appears most clearly supported by the pattern of defiance, refusal to follow authority, deliberate provocation of others, and externalization of blame across multiple settings. Conduct Disorder, childhood-onset type, warrants consideration given aggressive behaviors like profanity and desk-kicking, though more detail about physical aggression and property destruction would help clarify whether this is evolving beyond ODD. ADHD remains possible since non-compliance could reflect attention difficulties, but additional information about inattention and hyperactivity symptoms would be needed to specify the type. DMDD should be evaluated based on whether there's a persistently irritable mood between outbursts. Adjustment Disorder with Conduct Disturbance is relevant only if a specific identifiable stressor can be established. Adjustment Disorder with Disturbance of Conduct - F43.24, and Parent-child relational problem - Z62.820.

- Symptom onset before age 10 is supported by his 4th grade struggles and documented longstanding difficulties
- Symptoms manifest across multiple settings including home and school
- Age 15 falls within the diagnostic window of 6-18 years

2. **Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) - F91.3**
- Angry/irritable mood with argumentative behavior toward authority figures (principal confrontation)
- Possible vindictive component to his reactions
- Symptoms present for at least 6 months, likely much longer given the chronic nature of his difficulties

However, ODD alone doesn't fully account for the intensity of his aggressive behavior. The assault on a peer and multiple physical altercations suggest additional pathology. Conduct Disorder features like deceitfulness, theft, or property destruction aren't evident, and his care for pets indicates he's not displaying animal cruelty. He demonstrates some prosocial capacity through pet care and interest in outdoor activities like camping.

ADHD could be contributing to his difficulties. Academic struggles, grade repetition, and recent academic decline align with attention or executive function problems. Impulsivity may be driving some of the outbursts and physical confrontations, and ADHD frequently co-occurs with disruptive behavior disorders.

Depressive symptoms warrant consideration too—adolescent irritability can mask depression, and he's showing social withdrawal and academic deterioration. Though I lack information about other depressive features like anhedonia or sleep changes. Intermittent Explosive Disorder is less likely since his irritability appears chronic rather than episodic, and the pattern seems better explained by another condition.

DMDD emerges as the leading diagnosis because it captures both the persistent irritability across settings and the severe explosive episodes, with a longstanding course. I'd need to verify his symptoms began before age 10 to confirm this diagnosis. Actually, reconsidering conduct disorder—the DSM-5-TR requires 3 of 15 criteria met in the past 12 months with at least one in the past 6 months. Looking at aggression criteria: he initiates physical fights and has committed assault, which are clear matches. He possibly bullies others, but there's no evidence of weapon use, cruelty to animals (he cares for pets), or sexual coercion. For property destruction and deceitfulness, I don't have enough information about fire-setting, vandalism, or theft patterns to determine if additional criteria are satisfied.

The clinical picture does suggest conduct problems—fighting and assault are significant—but I'm uncertain whether a third criterion is definitively present. Still, the pattern warrants consideration. Given his longstanding behavioral difficulties since around age 9-10 and the chronic irritability noted, DMDD also fits the timeline, requiring symptom onset before age 10. The differential likely includes both conduct disorder and DMDD as possibilities.

A key diagnostic constraint: DSM-5-TR prohibits concurrent ODD and DMDD diagnoses, though conduct disorder can coexist with DMDD. If DMDD emerges as the primary diagnosis, ODD would be ruled out, leaving conduct disorder as a potential comorbid condition.

For conduct disorder specifically, I need to establish whether onset occurred before age 10 (childhood-type) or between 10-18 (adolescent-type). The repeated 4th grade placement and description of persistent behavioral issues suggest early emergence, pointing toward the childhood-onset specifier. Beyond the disruptive mood and conduct concerns, academic difficulties and impulsive behaviors warrant consideration of ADHD. Depressive features—particularly irritability as a mood symptom in adolescents—and social withdrawal patterns also merit evaluation, though some presentations may be secondary to the primary disruptive disorder rather than independent diagnoses. impulsivity, and frequent comorbidity with conduct issues. Depression may also be present given the irritability and social withdrawal typical in adolescents. Social isolation and avoidance during the interview point toward social anxiety, though Intermittent Explosive Disorder could explain the outbursts—but DSM-5-TR excludes this diagnosis when DMDD is present, as DMDD better accounts for the symptom pattern.

The final diagnostic picture centers on DMDD as the primary condition, with concurrent Conduct Disorder reflecting the aggressive behavior and rule violations, and ADHD addressing the academic and impulse-control difficulties.

However, I need to reconsider the conduct disorder classification more carefully. Looking at the specific criteria: initiating physical fights appears present from the school incidents and basketball altercation, and the peer assault suggests physical cruelty. But these two behaviors may overlap rather than represent distinct criteria. Conduct Disorder requires at least three criteria met in the past 12 months with at least one in the past six months, so I should verify whether I have sufficient independent criteria or if the diagnosis needs adjustment.

Given the pattern of aggressive behavior and the 15-year-old's longstanding difficulties dating back to repeating 4th grade, childhood-onset type would be appropriate if conduct disorder is diagnosed. I'm also considering whether a Specific Learning Disorder (F81.9) should be included, though the information doesn't clearly distinguish whether academic struggles stem from learning deficits or behavioral factors, so I may not prioritize this without more clarity.

For the differential diagnosis list, the most likely candidates are Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (F34.81), Conduct Disorder childhood-onset type (F91.1), ADHD unspecified (F90.9), Unspecified Depressive Disorder (F32.A), and Social Anxiety Disorder (F40.10). I should verify these codes are accurate—DMDD, Conduct Disorder, and ADHD codes check out, and F32.A is the correct DSM-5-TR code for Unspecified Depressive Disorder.

However, I'm reconsidering whether Unspecified Depressive Disorder truly fits. The irritability and social withdrawal could reflect depressive features in an adolescent, but there's limited evidence of other core symptoms like anhedonia or changes in sleep and appetite. The irritability seems more directly attributable to DMDD. Other possibilities like Intermittent Explosive Disorder (F63.81) shouldn't be diagnosed alongside DMDD, and Specific Learning Disorder (F81.9) or Adjustment Disorder lack sufficient supporting evidence. The current list appears solid.

Regarding Social Anxiety Disorder, the social isolation may stem from peer rejection due to his behavioral problems rather than primary anxiety. Still, it warrants inclusion in the differential. Specific Learning Disorder could be a fifth option given academic struggles, though the details about learning difficulties aren't clear enough. I'm settling on my five diagnoses, though I should verify whether Conduct Disorder should be classified as childhood-onset or adolescent-onset based on the presentation details.

The case mentions ""longstanding behavioral difficulties"" and grade repetition around age 9-10, which aligns with the childhood-onset threshold requiring symptoms before age 10. While the exact onset isn't specified, the timeline suggests problems were established by that age. I'll keep childhood-onset as the most probable classification. I also need to confirm that DMDD and ODD can't coexist per DSM-5-TR criteria, which I've already accounted for.

Looking back at DMDD, I'm checking whether the full symptom picture fits—particularly the severe recurrent temper outbursts, both verbal and behavioral, which do appear present based on his angry outbursts. No manic or hypomanic episodes present. While other conditions need consideration, the clinical picture aligns well with DMDD criteria.

The diagnostic formulation includes Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (F34.81) as the primary diagnosis, alongside Conduct Disorder childhood-onset type (F91.1), ADHD unspecified (F90.9), Unspecified Depressive Disorder (F32.A), and Social Anxiety Disorder (F40.10).","1.

108,"Frank Young, a 40-year-old business executive, was brought for a psychiatric consultation by his wife. While Mr. Young sat quietly beside her, she reported that a change had come over him during the last 6 months. He was either quiet and withdrawn or uncharacteristically irritable. He had begun to drink alcohol to excess in social situations, sometimes embarrassing her. He often came home late, or not at all, claiming to have been at the office. When away from home, he rarely answered phone calls and text messages. She wondered if he was having an affair. Mr. Young denied seeing anyone else and indicated he had just been having a hard time.
 
 After his wife left the psychiatrist’s office, Mr. Young reported a great deal of stress at work over the last year as he tried to deal with industry-wide setbacks and personal financial losses. He said he felt down and depressed most of the time. He reported difficulty sleeping most nights, loss of interest in his wife and children, low energy, and feelings of failure and self-criticism. He had frequent thoughts of wanting to be dead and of suicide, but he denied any suicidal intent or plans.
 
 When asked about the alcohol, he acknowledged that he had been drinking heavily for at least 6 months. When asked about other substances, he asked about therapeutic confidentiality and then acknowledged that he had been using cocaine several times per week for about 9 months. He kept his cocaine use from his wife because he knew she would be judgmental. In the beginning, cocaine put him in a reliably positive, optimistic mood, and he found that he could more successfully churn through large volumes of otherwise tedious and discouraging work. Although his work required some socializing in the evening, he also began to regularly go to bars in the evening just so that he would have a place to comfortably combine cocaine with alcohol. He craved the high from cocaine, went out of his way to obtain it, and spent a lot of time getting high that he would previously have been spending with his family.
 
 When asked to clarify the sequence of work stress, cocaine use, and depression symptoms, he reported that he had felt worried and discouraged about work for a year, but the feelings of depression, loss of interest, irritability, insomnia, and low self-esteem had not begun until about 6 months earlier, 3 months after he had begun to use cocaine regularly. He experienced those depressive symptoms most of the day every day, whether or not he had taken cocaine within the last several days.
 
 Mr. Young denied any previous episodes of depression, other mood or anxiety disorders, or suicide attempts. He drank socially. He had experimented with cannabis and cocaine as a teenager but had never developed a pattern of regular use or impairment until the past year.","Let me carefully analyze this clinical case vignette to extract the relevant information and develop an accurate differential diagnosis.

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

The patient meets criteria for cocaine use disorder given the 9-month pattern of frequent use, persistent craving, significant time spent obtaining and using the drug, and continued use despite clear interpersonal consequences like family neglect and deception. Alcohol use disorder is also evident with heavy drinking over 6 months that's causing social problems. Major depressive disorder appears present with persistent depressed mood, anhedonia, sleep disturbance, fatigue, guilt, and suicidal ideation—though the temporal relationship to cocaine use and the fact that symptoms persist independent of recent use suggests this may be a primary mood disorder rather than purely substance-induced. stress or substance use itself. The DSM-5-TR distinguishes between substance-induced and primary depressive disorders—symptoms must develop during or shortly after use, and the disturbance shouldn't be better explained by an independent disorder. However, there's an important caveat: if depressive symptoms persist substantially beyond acute intoxication or withdrawal, or if there's a history of independent depression, a primary Major Depressive Disorder diagnosis should be considered instead. Here the patient continues using cocaine actively, and his mood disturbance emerged after cocaine initiation, but the persistence of symptoms regardless of recent use patterns complicates the picture.

The temporal relationship between cocaine use and symptom onset points toward a substance-induced process, especially given no prior depressive history and the known neurobiological effects of chronic stimulant use. Yet the fact that depressive symptoms remain present even during periods without recent cocaine use suggests either persistent neuroadaptive changes from chronic use or possibly an independent depressive disorder that emerged in the context of substance use. Without a sustained period of abstinence, it's difficult to determine whether the depression would resolve or continue independently.

The psychosocial stressors—work difficulties, financial strain, and marital conflict—could also be contributing factors or even primary drivers of the mood disturbance. The differential includes Major Depressive Disorder as a possibility if these stressors are the primary etiology rather than the cocaine use itself. Adjustment Disorder seems less likely given that the patient now meets full criteria for a depressive syndrome rather than just a maladaptive response to stress.

The diagnostic picture includes Cocaine Use Disorder (moderate to severe), Cocaine-Induced Depressive Disorder, Alcohol Use Disorder from the six months of heavy drinking, and Major Depressive Disorder as competing explanations for the depressive presentation.

Reconsidering the primary diagnosis requires weighing whether the depression is substance-induced or independent. The timeline suggests the depressive symptoms emerged following cocaine use, supporting a substance-induced formulation. The severe presentation with suicidal ideation and significant functional impairment points to Cocaine Use Disorder, Severe as the underlying driver, with Cocaine-Induced Depressive Disorder (F14.24) as the secondary diagnosis capturing the mood disturbance. Alcohol Use Disorder, Moderate also warrants documentation given the sustained heavy use over six months. without psychotic features. Given the presentation, the primary diagnosis should be Cocaine Use Disorder, Severe with cocaine-induced depressive features, coded as F14.24. This single code captures both the dependence and the mood disturbance rather than requiring separate coding. I'm considering whether additional specification of the depressive severity is needed, though the induced mood disorder code may be sufficient for the clinical picture. the induced mood disorder code. The substance use disorder itself warrants a diagnosis code.

5. **Adjustment disorder with depressed mood** - F43.21
   - Less likely given the full depressive syndrome present, but worth considering if stressors are primary.

I'm recognizing that substance-induced disorders in DSM-5-TR often bundle the use disorder with the induced condition into a single code. So F14.24 captures both the cocaine dependence and the depressive episode it's causing. For alcohol, F10.20 represents moderate use disorder. If the depression appears independent of substance use, F32.1 would apply as a separate diagnosis. The cocaine use disorder code F14.20 might be used if coding the substance use separately from mood effects. Finally, F43.21 is less fitting here since the depressive symptoms meet full criteria rather than representing a stress response.

The core issue is determining causality: does the depression stem from cocaine use, or is it a separate condition? The timeline shows cocaine use preceded symptoms by three months, and there's no prior depressive history. However, symptoms continuing during abstinence periods complicates this picture. This suggests either the depression has become independent of the substance, or the substance-induced effects are more persistent than typical.

According to DSM-5-TR criteria, if depressive symptoms persist roughly a month after stopping use, an independent disorder should be considered. Since this patient continues active use, I can't definitively establish that threshold. Based on the temporal relationship and absence of prior episodes, cocaine-induced depressive disorder appears most likely, though major depressive disorder remains a reasonable differential diagnosis given the symptom persistence.

For coding, F14.24 (cocaine dependence with induced mood disorder) already encompasses both the substance use and mood disturbance, so listing F14.20 separately would be redundant. The primary diagnosis should be the induced disorder, with major depressive disorder and adjustment disorder as alternatives if the depression proves independent of the cocaine use. Looking at the diagnostic options, I need to decide whether the depression is primarily substance-induced or independent. The clinical presentation—with depression emerging during heavy cocaine use and the patient's acknowledgment of drug-related mood changes—suggests the mood disturbance is cocaine-induced. If I code it that way, F14.24 captures both the cocaine dependence and induced mood disorder together. However, if the depression appears to have its own trajectory separate from substance use, I'd list F14.20 for cocaine dependence and F32.1 for major depressive disorder as distinct diagnoses. The anxiety symptoms warrant inclusion as well, though they seem secondary to the primary substance use and mood concerns. Given the case details pointing toward substance-induced etiology, the most parsimonious approach consolidates the cocaine and mood components into a single code. The most clinically accurate approach is to prioritize F14.24 (cocaine-induced depressive disorder) as the primary diagnosis since it captures both the cocaine dependence and the depression it's causing. Alcohol use disorder, moderate (F10.20) should be listed as a secondary diagnosis. Major depressive disorder (F32.1) could serve as a differential if the depression appears independent of substance use. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood (F43.21) is less likely given the clear substance use etiology. The key is avoiding redundancy—F14.24 already encompasses the cocaine use disorder component, so listing it separately would be duplicative.

Reconsidering severity based on the clinical presentation: suicidal ideation without plan, persistent depressed mood throughout the day, and multiple neurovegetative symptoms (insomnia, anhedonia, fatigue, guilt) suggest moderate-to-severe depression. This points toward F32.2 rather than F32.1. The presence of suicidal thinking, even without intent or plan, elevates the severity rating and warrants the more serious classification.","1.

97,"Sebastian Lopez, a 27-year-old Hispanic freelance editor, was brought to his long-time HIV clinic by his worried partner. As the patient entered the clinic waiting room, he announced, “God has cured me! I can stop my antivirals!”
 
 While Mr. Lopez fidgeted on a chair, furiously writing on a yellow pad, his partner provided the recent history. He said that the patient had been doing well until approximately 1 month earlier. At that point, he began an unusually intense editing project. After about 10 days of little sleep, “boundless energy,” and activity, Mr. Lopez seemed edgy, a little pressured, and “glassy-eyed.” That night, the two of them went to a party to celebrate the completion of the work project. Despite several years of Narcotics Anonymous meetings and abstinence from illicit substances, Mr. Lopez took crystal methamphetamine, a stimulant. Acutely anxious and paranoid that they were being followed, Mr. Lopez drank three martinis but still did not sleep that night. Over the ensuing days the patient became less paranoid, but he appeared increasingly distracted and his speech was more pressured.
 
 Mr. Lopez’s work project was returned with multiple negative comments and requests for corrections. Instead of focusing on his editing, however, he stayed up late every night, intent on finding a cure for HIV. He made inappropriate, hypersexual advances toward other men at the gym, where he spent much of the day. He lost at least 5 pounds after deciding he should take vitamin supplements instead of food and his antiretroviral medication. He refused to go to the emergency room but finally agreed to come to his routine AIDS clinic appointment to show his doctors how well he had done despite not having taken his medications in over a month.
 
 Mr. Lopez’s psychiatric history was without a prior episode of clear-cut mania, but he had been depressed as a teenager during the early phase of his coming-out process. That episode was punctuated by a purposeful overdose and a 2-week psychiatric hospitalization and treatment with antidepressant medication and psychotherapy. Mr. Lopez had discontinued the medication because it made him “hyper and edgy,” and he stopped the psychotherapy because “it was pointless.” He used methamphetamine frequently for several years, which led to recurrent unprotected intercourse with strangers.
 
 Mr. Lopez was diagnosed with HIV at age 22, at which point he went to an outpatient substance use disorder rehabilitation center and discontinued his use of stimulants and alcohol. His lowest CD4 lymphocyte count had been 216 cells/mm3, when he was age 24, at which time his viral load was 1.6 million copies. He had been reportedly adherent to his antiretroviral medications since then. His most recent CD4 count, 6 months prior to this episode, had been 526 cells/mm3. His viral load had been undetectable. He had suffered fatigue but had not had any AIDS-defining illnesses. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain revealed mild cortical atrophy and periventricular white matter disease in excess of what would be expected for his age. The partner was unsure when Mr. Lopez had discontinued his antiretrovirals but thought it might have been months earlier. He also wondered if Mr. Lopez had “lost a step” cognitively over the past year.
 
 His family psychiatric history was significant for a maternal aunt who had received lithium and several courses of electroconvulsive therapy, but her diagnosis was unknown.
 
 On examination, the patient was a sloppily dressed young man who told a pressured, disjointed story of events over the prior month. He was difficult to direct and was uncharacteristically irritable and devaluing. He was preoccupied with having discovered a cure for HIV through multivitamins and exercise. He denied hallucinations and suicidal and homicidal ideation. He refused cognitive testing, and his insight and judgment appeared poor.","Let me carefully analyze this clinical case vignette to formulate an accurate differential diagnosis.

The clinical picture suggests Bipolar I Disorder, Current Episode Manic. He displays the hallmark features of mania—decreased sleep need, pressured speech, grandiosity, increased goal-directed activity, distractibility, and risky behaviors including hypersexuality and medication non-adherence—all present for approximately one month. Notably, these symptoms appear to have emerged before the methamphetamine use 10 days ago, with early signs including sleep deprivation, boundless energy, and pressured speech preceding the party where drug use occurred.

His family history of an aunt on lithium and prior depressive episodes with possible antidepressant-induced mood elevation further support an underlying bipolar diathesis. While methamphetamine use disorder is clearly present with years of problematic use and recent relapse, the temporal relationship and persistence of manic symptoms weeks after a single use makes a purely substance-induced presentation unlikely. The stimulant exposure may be exacerbating an already dysregulated mood state rather than causing it entirely.

The MRI findings showing cortical atrophy and white matter changes beyond what would be expected for his age, combined with his partner's report of cognitive decline over the past year, raise concern for HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder—though his refusal of testing limits our ability to assess severity. His history of adolescent depression with a suicide attempt likely represents an earlier manifestation of bipolar illness rather than a separate depressive disorder.

The most probable diagnosis appears to be Bipolar I Disorder in a current manic episode, with complicating factors including active methamphetamine use disorder and possible underlying HIV-related neurological involvement. confirm severity without formal neuropsychological testing. The acute paranoia and anxiety he experienced could stem from stimulant intoxication rather than a separate anxiety disorder. Looking at the ICD-10 coding more carefully, I need to distinguish between major and mild neurocognitive disorder presentations—major neurocognitive disorder due to HIV uses F02.81 when behavioral disturbance is present, while mild presentations fall under different coding conventions.

For substance use, stimulant use disorder with amphetamine-type substances codes to F15.20 regardless of severity level, whereas alcohol use disorder varies by severity (F10.10 for mild, F10.20 for moderate). Given all these factors, the primary diagnoses should be bipolar I disorder in severe manic episode as the foundational condition, followed by the stimulant use disorder as a secondary but significant contributor to his current presentation.

The neurocognitive decline from HIV infection with behavioral disturbance warrants inclusion given the MRI findings and collateral reports of cognitive changes. Alcohol use disorder, though mild, remains relevant given his recovery history and recent use. While stimulant-induced mood disorder could theoretically explain the manic features, the timeline and symptom pattern suggest an independent bipolar disorder that predates and exists separately from the substance use, making this a less likely primary diagnosis.

The key distinction is that his elevated mood and decreased need for sleep began before the methamphetamine exposure at the party, and his symptoms have persisted for weeks beyond what would be expected from a single stimulant use. Combined with his family history and prior depressive episodes, this supports Bipolar I Disorder as the primary diagnosis rather than a substance-induced condition. His teenage depression likely represents an earlier manifestation of the bipolar illness rather than a separate major depressive disorder. The grandiose beliefs about discovering an HIV cure appear to meet criteria for delusions, suggesting the presence of psychotic features that would elevate the severity rating to F31.2 rather than F31.13. The grandiose beliefs about finding a cure for HIV through multivitamins and exercise—combined with his refusal to take antiretroviral medications—suggest either true delusions or severe grandiosity with markedly impaired judgment. Since the assessment doesn't explicitly confirm psychotic features beyond these preoccupations, F31.13 (severe without psychotic features) is the safer choice, though F31.2 remains reasonable if these are considered delusional. The other diagnoses include moderate stimulant use disorder, neurocognitive disorder secondary to HIV with behavioral symptoms, and mild alcohol use disorder. Major depressive disorder would be subsumed under the bipolar diagnosis rather than coded separately. Looking back at the stimulant intoxication angle - he's not currently acutely intoxicated, so that doesn't fit. But stimulant-induced bipolar disorder (F15.24) could be a reasonable alternative consideration given the substance use history and mood presentation.

For the final diagnoses: Bipolar I Disorder, Current Episode Manic, Severe (F31.13) remains primary. The methamphetamine use disorder should be coded as moderate (F15.20) since the recent relapse means he's no longer in remission. Major Neurocognitive Disorder Due to HIV with behavioral disturbance completes the picture, accounting for the possible cognitive decline his partner mentioned. anic, severe, with psychotic features) instead of F31.13.

Let me think about the threshold for psychotic features. Grandiose delusions are fixed, false beliefs that are acted upon. His statements about being cured by God and discovering an HIV cure through supplements—beliefs he's acting on by discontinuing medications—do meet criteria for delusions. This would elevate the diagnosis to F31.2 with psychotic features rather than F31.13 without them.

The primary diagnosis should be Bipolar I Disorder, Current Episode Manic, Severe, With Psychotic Features (F31.2). The remaining diagnoses include Stimulant Use Disorder (F15.20), Major Neurocognitive Disorder from HIV with behavioral disturbance (F02.81), Alcohol Use Disorder (F10.10), and Stimulant-Induced Bipolar and Related Disorder.

However, I need to reconsider whether the grandiose preoccupation truly constitutes a psychotic feature. The distinction between grandiosity and grandiose delusions matters here—his conviction about discovering an HIV cure through vitamins could reflect inflated self-importance rather than a fixed false belief. Without clear evidence that he maintains this belief despite contradictory information, F31.13 (manic episode without psychotic features) might be more appropriate than F31.2.

Given the diagnostic uncertainty around psychotic features and the need for additional information about the severity of his cognitive decline, I'm settling on F31.13 as the primary diagnosis for bipolar disorder. The stimulant use disorder, HIV-related neurocognitive changes, and alcohol use would be coded separately, though I should verify whether his cognitive impairment meets criteria for major versus mild neurocognitive disorder based on functional impact. The MRI changes and behavioral disturbance point toward major NCD rather than mild, so I'll stick with that diagnosis. For HIV-related cognitive decline, DSM-5-TR specifies Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to HIV Infection—coded with the HIV diagnosis first (B20), then F02.8x for the behavioral component. Since the question asks for F-codes and the clinical presentation suggests major NCD, F02.81 fits best.","1. Bipolar I Disorder, Current Episode Manic, Severe - F31.13
