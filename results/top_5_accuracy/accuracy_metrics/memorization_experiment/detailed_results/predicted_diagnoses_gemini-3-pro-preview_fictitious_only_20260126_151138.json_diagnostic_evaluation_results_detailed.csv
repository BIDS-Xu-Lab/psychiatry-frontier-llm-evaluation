1001,"Leroy is a 34 year old male, whose chief complaint is, “I am having intrusive thoughts.” Leroy reports that “since childhood, I have been experiencing intrusive thoughts.” He reports he has met with a number of psychiatrists in the past, and has tried a range of different psychiatric medications. Leroy reports he was recently recommended by his present physician to see a psychiatrist again, given how distressing his intrusive thoughts have become. His previous psychiatrist started him on Zoloft, and gave him recommendation for community based mental health psychotherapist.  Leroy has been taking the Zoloft (200 mg daily) for about 5 years, for what he states his provider thought was “anxiety or depression.” Leroy acknowledges history of periods of “sadness”, stating “yeah sad, sometimes, but not depressed; when things get out of control; its been a while though; when something feels out of reach.” Denied present or past suicidal ideation, and denied problems with active thoughts, plans or intents of harm to self or others. Leroy insists no problems with perceptual distortion or paranoia, and denied thought insertion or thought broadcasting.  Leroy stated that the intrusive thoughts, “first started happening when I was a kid, I was able to cope with them; getting better understanding what they were; ways to get them to go away; calm myself down and regain control and go on with my life; now that is not working.” Leroy states the most recent intrusive thought has been a fear that the chart bus he drives from his local airport to downtown stop will “slide off the road because of ice or snow.” He thinks about this, on average, about 30 to 45 minutes a day.  Leroy endorsed episodes of “panic” and “my body almost feels like its paralyzed; I experience pain from my spine up”, which lasts for a couple of days at a time. With regards to “generalized anxiety”, patient reports “I would have these thoughts about my ailing mother; she has schizophrenia; my body would react to whatever I was thinking about her; my body tenses up when that happens.” Leroy denied any preoccupations about his physical health, nor inability to leave the home because of anxiety. He reports to work regularly, and rarely misses any work unless he is very sick. He says he is never late to work or planned appointments. Leroy has a girlfriend, and says that relationship is going “great.” In his spare time, he continues to join his friends for basketball pickup games and video game nights, which he still enjoys. Leroy does remember a feeling of having to tap the door handle a few times before he opens it, but said this never lasted more than a few second and was not associated with any fear of catastrophic consequences if he did not complete the task.  Leroy acknowledges observed violence/abuse of his parents when growing up, and with harsh parenting to his 3 siblings, patient denied problems with flashbacks, nightmares or hypervigilance associated with the trauma. Patient works second shift, gets home around 1:30 a.m., reports falling asleep at 2:30 a.m. and wakes up at 10/11 a.m., and can typically sleep through the night without interruption. He reports his energy level is “normal through the week.” Denied recent or past mania. Reports contributing stressors are “work --- not the most peaceful environment.” Also reports mother suffers from “type of schizophrenia and for a while she was taking medication and just recently now decided to stop; that’s been going on for quite some time.” Leroy’s urine toxicology returned with marijuana, and TSH level was within normal limits.",Obsessive compulsive disorder (F42.8),,judah_weathers,,,,"**My Diagnostic Process: A Clinician's Internal Dialogue**

Okay, here's how I'm approaching this clinical vignette. First, the task: expert psychiatrist, diagnosing based on DSM-5-TR, level 5 performance on data extraction and diagnostic reasoning, but *only* a structured list of the top 5 F-coded diagnoses. No explanation needed. Got it.

I'm analyzing the data meticulously. Leroy, 34-year-old male, intrusive thoughts as chief complaint. Childhood onset. Multiple prior treatments. Zoloft 200mg, that's high dose, probably because of a lack of response or greater severity. His coping mechanisms are failing, that's important. The bus thing is a clear obsession, right? Snow and ice, intrusive thought, 30-45 minutes. That *might* hit the duration criteria. Mental acts to ""make them go away"" sound like mental compulsions and neutralizing. He denies catastrophic fears with tapping, but it's a *history* of tapping; can't ignore it. The panic episodes lasting days are atypical; sounds more somatic. Paralysis and pain, that's not a panic attack. Worry about his mother, that's generalized anxiety. The fact he's working and has a good relationship shows good functioning but that is not sufficient in itself.

Let's see: Denies depression, suicidal ideation, and mania, energy is normal, sleep is regular. Denies psychosis, but family history of schizophrenia is a concern. The childhood abuse/violence is relevant, but the denial of flashbacks and nightmares essentially rules out PTSD. Cannabis positive U-tox, but we don't have the details for severity. TSH is normal; the medicals are clear.

Now the reasoning: OCD is primary. The intrusive thoughts, the time spent, the ""ways to make them go away,"" the history of tapping, and that Zoloft dose all point toward it. That specific bus fear *screams* OCD. GAD is secondary, worry about mom, work, and that physical tension fits with the description. Cannabis use, that's a positive U-Tox, that needs to be listed. Somatic Symptom Disorder, definitely something that's on my mind based on the physical symptoms. The duration of the panic-like episodes is *key* here. It's not a standard panic attack. I'm noting the patient's denial of preoccupations about the physical symptoms, but the description of the paralysis/pain is just so specific. No PTSD, no major depression, no panic.

Let's refine: OCD first, absolutely. Generalized Anxiety next, then Cannabis, then the somatic presentation (maybe Unspecified). What about that history of depression? The Zoloft? Even though he denies current depression, the treatment history means it's a valid thing to include.

I am finalizing the differential. OCD: F42.2 Mixed obsessional thoughts and compulsive acts. GAD: F41.1. Cannabis Use Unspecified: F12.90 (safest given the lack of specific details). Next, F45.9 Unspecified Somatic Symptom and Related Disorder. And the fifth? His past history and treatment indicates that depressive disorder of some kind, even though the current presentation is not depressed.

So the final list: OCD, GAD, Cannabis, Somatic, and Depressive. Those are the diagnoses I will share. Final check on the codes? Yes. OCD is F42.2 to specify Mixed, GAD F41.1, Cannabis F12.90 is right given that use and no details on severity, Somatic F45.9 and depressive disorder is F32.9. Final.

I am ready.

1002,"Emil is a 22 year old male that reports “my mom wanted us to meet because she spent her whole first therapy session talking to another therapist at her new program about how she feels I need help; I suspect it has to do with my multiple sclerosis (MS), recently losing my fiancé (Lizzy), and after loosing my dog that came with my fiancé. I also lost my career as a farmer.” The patient reports “My girlfriend and I had a good relationship when I used to be able to fish with her; she was a blue blood from the Cape.” Patient reports that he survived being “attacked when I was at a local bar about 4 years ago; the guy smashed a few beer bottles on my head; I had to go to the hospital and they did brain scans; I don’t remember what they said they found.” Patient reports that after that attack, he stopped fishing and started drinking alcohol heavily, at least 8 standard drinks per day, resulting in him missing work, the end of his relationship with his girlfriend, and resulted in getting two DUIs. Patient remembers, “I tried cutting down, but I was never able to do it.” The patient has been sober from alcohol for 76 days now. He denied any other drug use. Patient reports that around two years ago, “I was starting having another MS flare, I stopped being able to sleep for about two weeks and felt angry all the time.” Patient reports during that time he took several last minute trips to Baltimore by train, trying to start a new business and during that time had many sexual indiscretions. He states “people said I was acting strange and that I claimed I was a celebrity that was going to find a cure for autism.” Emil states “I felt like I had endless energy and could take on the world.” The patient reports no similar episodes like that since then, and denied any major mood symptoms since that time. Emil denied recent or past hallucinations, paranoia or thought insertion. Emil reports he never experienced trauma, with the exception of losing his girlfriend and dog. The patient denied any recent problems with depressed, sad, or hopeless mood, and denied problems recent problems with decreased need for sleep and associated elevated energy, racing thoughts, pressured speech or feelings of euphoria. He denied recent or past anxiety or panic, nor OCD.","Bipolar disorder, most recent episode manic, in remission (F31.74), Alcohol use disorder, initial remission (F10.21), Mood disorder due to a known physiologic condition with manic features (F06.33)",,judah_weathers,,,,"**Diagnostic Formulation and ICD-10 Coding (Internal Thought Process)**

Alright, here's my assessment of Emil's case.  I've thoroughly reviewed the history, keeping in mind the need for a nuanced, expert-level diagnosis that integrates the organic and psychiatric aspects of his presentation, with a focus on F-codes.

My primary diagnosis reflects the most significant *psychiatric* concern and its link to the medical context. This patient has a clear history of a manic episode, which, given the vignette's explicit temporal relationship with an MS flare, strongly suggests **Bipolar and Related Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition, with manic features (F06.33)**.  I'm prioritizing this diagnosis because of the strong causal link indicated and the known impact of MS on mood regulation.

Next, I'm noting the patient's history of significant alcohol use. Despite his reported period of abstinence, the severity of his past use, documented social and occupational impairment (DUIs, lost relationships, etc.), and failed attempts to cut down warrant a diagnosis of **Alcohol Use Disorder, Severe (F10.20)**, even if he's not currently actively using. I'm focusing on ""severe"" because of the number of symptoms and level of impairment.  

Third, I'm incorporating the recent stressors, even though he denies any acute distress. Given the stated losses, along with his mother's concern, the most fitting diagnosis is **Adjustment Disorder, Unspecified (F43.20)**. While he denies specific mood symptoms (anxiety or depression), the circumstances suggest an ongoing struggle to adapt, prompting the need for psychiatric evaluation.

Fourth, I'm including the impact of the TBI. While details are scant, the violent assault, subsequent behavioral changes (cessation of fishing, onset of alcohol use) and the memory gap of the scans, is compelling evidence of a **Personality Change Due to Another Medical Condition (F07.0)**.  The F-code for the personality change is the most precise for a personality change following the TBI.

Finally, I'm considering the potential for lingering cognitive effects from the TBI. Though no current cognitive complaints are described, the history suggests **Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Traumatic Brain Injury (F06.7)** is appropriate. This diagnosis is supported by the reported brain scans and memory challenges related to the TBI. While some overlap with Personality Change is present, these diagnoses highlight different dimensions of Emil's post-TBI profile (both psychiatric and cognitive)

Here's the final list:
1.  Bipolar and Related Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition, with manic features - F06.33

1003,"Neveah is a 14 year old girl that comes to her pediatrician with her mother (presently 4 months pregnant) due to “out of control behaviors at home.” The patient appears restless in the exam room and requiring redirection from her mother throughout the visit. The patient frequently punches her mother in the legs, and in the stomach, and the patient even threw her ipad at the pediatrician when she asked the patient what was upsetting her. Most of the patients psychiatric history is gathered from her mother, given how irritable the patient is during the exam. The mother reports Neveah was born 8 weeks pre-mature, spent about 1 month in the neonatal intensive care unit due to problems with breathing, and ultimately discharged home to her care at one month of age. The patient met developmental milestones on or near expected time, and was “clingy” when she was a toddler, but had no problems making friends in daycare and grade school. When patient was about 11 years of age, her biological father left the home to join the military, and has deployed ever since. Around 12 years of age, around summertime, the patient appeared much more talkative, energetic, and would go several days only needing about 3 hours of sleep at night. She was more impulsive during these times, and believed she had super powers to “make her friends get in trouble at school”, even when she was not at school herself. She was never tired the following day. During that same period, she had many temper tantrums throughout the day, almost every day of the week, that seemed disproportionate to circumstances, like having to have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich instead of a peanut butter and fluff sandwich. The tantrums would last several hours in a day. This pattern of behavior would last for several weeks at a time, with periods of months returning to normal mood and behavior. The patient never appeared to be hallucination or responding to internal stimuli, and never appeared sad or depressed. Neveah had to be hospitalized during an episode like this when she was 13 years old. Neveah refuses to take medications for her symptoms. The start of this year academic year, that patient appeared more calm and in good behavioral control, but began to have similar symptoms of irritability, violence at home, not needing to sleep, talking fast, and property destruction at home.","Bipolar disorder, current episode manic (F31.2)",,judah_weathers,,,,"**Diagnostic Formulation - Expert Opinion**

Okay, here's my considered assessment, drawing on my expertise and adhering meticulously to the provided rubric and constraints. This case presents a complex picture that demands a nuanced approach:

1.  **Bipolar I Disorder, Current episode manic, severe with psychotic features (F31.2)**: This is the central diagnosis. The clear, episodic nature of the symptoms—the grandiosity manifesting as ""superpowers,"" the decreased sleep lasting for days, the hospitalization—all strongly point to a manic episode. The current irritability, aggression, and ""talking fast"" align perfectly with the manic presentation. The presence of a delusion, specifically the belief in superpowers, definitively warrants the ""with psychotic features"" specifier (F31.2) over (F31.1).

2.  **Conduct Disorder, Adolescent-onset type (F91.2)**: The concerning level of aggression, specifically the physical violence (punching the pregnant mother) and property destruction (throwing the iPad), raises serious concerns. While some of the behaviors could be attributed to the manic state, the severity and the described “out of control behaviors” demand consideration of a comorbid diagnosis. I'm focusing on ""Adolescent-onset type"" given the age of symptom onset (12).

3.  **Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Combined presentation (F90.2)**: Even though ADHD symptoms seemingly start at age 12, the level of restlessness, and need for redirection make it the most likely diagnosis. As per the rubric, the presentation is common in pediatric bipolar, and, in practice, ADHD is high on the differential diagnosis. Even if her prior milestones were ""met"", a history from an informant is often unreliable.

4.  **Separation Anxiety Disorder (F93.0)**: The history of being ""clingy"" as a toddler, and the reported reaction after the father's departure, are consistent with separation anxiety.

5.  **Unspecified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder (F43.9)**: The onset of symptoms roughly coinciding with the father's deployment suggests a significant stressor.

1004,"Elain is a 63 year old mother of 5 children and 12 grandchildren, that presents to urgent care with a chief complaint of “I’m hallucinating.” Elain reports no history of depression or manic, and was in her usual state of health until 27 days ago when she witnessed a pedestrian be struck by a moving vehicle in her neighborhood. Elain tried to rescue the pedestrian, and even helped paramedics the responded to the scene provide chest compressions to the pedestrian. Unfortunately the pedestrian was pronounced dead on the scene. Since then, Elain has felt a sense of “dread” and “anxiety” everyday, and feels like every time she hears a cars wheels skid in the street, “I jump out of my skin.” The patient also reports that, when at work, she will have these persistent images of the pedestrian laying in the street, and “I just can’t get the images out of my head.” Elain reports that wakes two or three times a night with nightmares related to the event. Additionally, Elain herself has avoided drying, for fear she will be involved in a car accident herself.

She denied visual or auditory hallucinations.",Acute stress disorder (F43.0),,judah_weathers,,,,"**Analysis of Diagnostic Possibilities: Elain's Case**

Alright, let's break this down. Elain, a 63-year-old woman, presents with a complex reaction to a traumatic event – witnessing a fatal accident 27 days ago. No prior history of psychiatric issues, which is important. The core issue, as I see it, is a clear acute stress reaction.

First, I go straight to the *Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders* section of the DSM-5-TR. The precipitating event—actual death—meets Criterion A for potential diagnoses. My primary consideration? *Acute Stress Disorder (ASD)*. The timeline, less than a month (27 days), is perfect. Elain's symptoms strongly align: intrusion (persistent images and nightmares), negative mood (dread and anxiety), dissociation (depersonalization), avoidance (driving), and arousal (hypervigilance, startle response). I've got to make sure to check off that symptom count, which, from what I see, is at least 7, probably 9 if we include the dread in the negative mood category and the avoidance and startle. I'm noting the dissociation as depersonalization. Since the case is at 27 days, this fits better than the PTSD diagnosis, which is the most likely *next* diagnosis. The ICD-10 code here is F43.0.

However, I also have to consider *Adjustment Disorder*. It is usually considered when stressors don't fully meet Criterion A for trauma, or if symptoms don't fully meet the criteria for ASD or PTSD. In this instance, it's a fallback if I can't definitively tick the 9-symptom box for ASD. Given Elain's distress, and the event, I'm leaning toward *Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood* as the most appropriate type here – F43.23. The ""dread"" does give me a bit of pause, but I have to try to consider all of the possible options.

Now, let's tackle *Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder*. Elain's description of her out-of-body experience (""felt like my body separated from my mind"") aligns with depersonalization. However, if this is exclusively during another disorder, you *don't* diagnose it separately. Because the DSM is clear about not diagnosing this if the *ASD* is present, this is a distinct point of the patient's presentation, and the symptom is a key part of the differential, it's relevant to consider and I will include it. I'll make sure to note that the depersonalization is a symptom here. F48.1.

Moving along, the chief complaint of ""hallucinating"" gives me reason to think of a *Brief Psychotic Disorder*. I have to consider and rule this out. Given the history of not true hallucinations or delusions, I'm able to rule it out, with this explanation. I'll still list this as it is the patient's chief complaint. F23.

Given that she might not fit full criteria for the most likely diagnoses, I am also thinking of *Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder*. This is the catch-all for when things aren't quite clear-cut. F43.8. Or, perhaps Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) but I have to exclude it given the timeline. However, ASD is the best fit.

Also, generalized anxiety is possible given the dread and anxiety, but that requires a 6-month timeline. And panic disorder is not likely unless there are full panic attacks that are spontaneous. So, I will remove these.

Given the sleep disruption, and the ""nightmares,"" *Nightmare Disorder* must be considered. While technically the ""nightmares"" are caused by an ASD, if I am trying to determine the specific diagnostic considerations, this is something I will have to note, and list as well.

With that, let's refine the list. To be an expert, I must consider all the possibilities.

So, here's my top 5, after considering the hierarchy and refining the criteria, in the most likely order and formatted. These are the *current* most likely differential diagnoses, with their corresponding ICD-10 codes:

1.  **Acute stress disorder - F43.0**
2.  **Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood - F43.23**

1005,"A 19 year old male comes to his primary care off reporting “I think someone has poisoned me at home.” The patient reports that about two and a half months ago, after he lost his job at a local arcade, he started noticing that he was feeling more sleepy at home. He states “I would go to bed around 7 p.m., right after dinner, and not wake up until about 12 p.m. the next day.” He reports before that time, he would go to bed around 10:30 p.m. and wake for work around 6 a.m. He states, “I started to notice that my mom would take longer preparing my plate of food for dinner, and I felt sleepy right after.” He endorsed associated low energy, low motivation and problems with concentration starting around that time. Patient goes on to say “over the past two months, every afternoon when I wake up, I can hear my parents whispering through the vents of the house, planning on killing me and replacing me with a different person.” Patient states he will sometimes also “hear them whispering when I’m at the store getting food and stuff, even though they are all the way back at home.” The patient reports that when he logs onto his ipad to play video games, “I can tell that some of the other characters of the game are my parents pretending to be other people. They are trying to get into my head.” The patient reports over the past 3 weeks he has stopped eating dinner, remains withdrawn to his room, and keeps the shades drawn “because I don’t want them looking into my windows.” The patient denied any other similar periods of symptoms like this in the past, denied illicit substance use (patients urine toxicology returns negative of all substance), and denied recent head injury or seizure. He denied active thoughts, plans or intents of harm to self or others. There are no guns in the home. About halfway through the exam, that patient grabs his jacket and runs out of the doctors office stating “forget it, I can tell you are working with my parents to kill me too.",Schizophreniform Disorder (F20.81) or F33.3 (Depression with psychotic features),,judah_weathers,,,,"**My Diagnostic Process**

Okay, here's how I'm approaching this clinical case. First, I need to understand the constraints and expectations. I'm acting as an expert psychiatrist, and the goal is a DSM-5-TR based diagnosis, but I'm limited to the provided information. No outside knowledge or opinions, and the output needs to be a structured list of diagnoses with ICD-10 codes. My primary focus is data extraction and diagnostic reasoning, at a high level.

Next, I'm diving into the vignette itself, extracting key data points. There's a 19-year-old male with a presenting complaint centered around poisoning fears. The timeline is crucial: the symptoms emerged after losing a job two-and-a-half months ago, and they've been persistent. I'm noting significant symptoms: hypersomnia, persecutory delusions (mom poisoning, parents planning to replace him, doctor in on it), delusions of control/reference (video game characters), auditory hallucinations (parents whispering), and negative/depressive symptoms (low energy, motivation, social withdrawal, appetite changes). There's no history of similar episodes, negative toxicology, and the patient denied suicidal/homicidal ideation initially but fled.

The duration is key because it guides my diagnostic options. I'm focusing on the psychotic features combined with the mood symptoms.

I'm now starting my diagnostic reasoning. Based on the patient's presentation, I'm immediately leaning towards psychosis with affective components. I'm considering several possibilities.

Firstly, Schizophreniform Disorder is the strongest contender. The patient meets criteria A for psychosis (delusions, hallucinations, negative symptoms) and the duration of 2.5 months fits the criteria for Schizophreniform disorder, which is between one and six months.

Secondly, I'm considering Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features. The job loss is a possible trigger, and the neurovegetative symptoms (hypersomnia, low energy, appetite change) point towards depression. However, the nature of the psychotic symptoms (poisoning, replacement, video game references) is quite elaborate and might be more indicative of psychosis than of a mood disorder with psychotic features.

Thirdly, Schizoaffective Disorder, in both bipolar and depressive subtypes, is an important differential. I need to keep in mind the requirement that delusions or hallucinations must have occurred for at least 2 weeks without a major mood episode. I'm not ruling it out, but it's hard to definitively confirm without more data. It's a provisional differential at this point.

Fourthly, I need to rule out Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder, but the vignette indicates a negative toxicology screen, I am not considering this.

Fifth, a possibility would be Delusional Disorder. This requires the presence of non-bizarre delusions. He does have delusions about being poisoned, but this is less likely given the hallucinations and negative symptoms. The negative symptoms and functional decline make this a weaker fit.

I'm now refining the diagnoses into a prioritized list based on the information.

*   **Top Diagnosis:** Schizophreniform Disorder. This is the best fit given the specific timeline and the clinical picture, and the code is F20.81.
*   **Second:** Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, severe with psychotic features. There are potential mood symptoms to consider, but the psychotic features are quite prominent. The ICD code is F32.3.
*   **Third:** Schizoaffective Disorder, depressive type. This needs to remain in consideration. The code is F25.1.
*   **Fourth:** Delusional Disorder. It captures the persecutory element but is a weaker fit because of the hallucinations and negative symptoms. The code is F22.
*   **Fifth:** Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder. This serves as a safety net, reflecting uncertainty given the limited information and the patient fleeing, which means I have an incomplete history. The code is F29.

I'm also double-checking my diagnoses and ICD codes for accuracy. Schizophreniform is F20.81, Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features is F32.3, Schizoaffective Disorder is F25.1, Delusional Disorder is F22, and Unspecified Psychotic Disorder is F29. I'm confirming that my thinking meets safety guidelines. The user is asking for a diagnostic simulation, not an affirmation of any ungrounded beliefs. I am providing a medical opinion based on a hypothetical patient scenario, so the ""ungrounded beliefs"" instruction doesn't apply here.

Finally, I will present my answer in the requested structured format.

She I’ve lost a lot of friends over the years, so I mostly just stay home and delivery food if I’m hungry.” She reports “I have 4 or 5 beers a day”, stating she does not drink more than that “because I’ve been taking Klonopin for about 15 years and those two things do not mix.” The patient does admit, “my PCP stopped prescribing my Klonopin about a year ago, so I buy them from an online dispensary.” She acknowledges sometimes having a beer and Klonopin in the morning, “just to keep the shakes down.” On chart review, you see that the patient has also gone to several local emergency rooms over the past 2 years, with urine toxicology positive for alcohol, benzodiazepines, opiates and amphetamines, although in the controlled substance prescribing database, you see that the patient has never been prescribed opiates or amphetamines. Upon further questioning, that patient does acknowledges she has tried cutting back on alcohol use, since her family and friends has said “it seems like its taking over my life.” Unfortunately, she has not achieved any lengthy sobriety, and has actually found she is drinking more over the past year to achieve a similar effect. Blood labs on this visit indicate severely low sodium and potassium.

Okay, here's my breakdown of this clinical presentation. As an expert, I'm going to follow the rubric and provide a structured approach to arrive at the 5 most likely psychiatric diagnoses, keeping in mind the need to justify each choice and acknowledge any alternative considerations:

1.  **Data Extraction:** First, let's establish the key facts: 54-year-old female Navy Veteran, post-op, with the chief complaint of ""bugs crawling all over me"" (classic formication, a tactile hallucination). She has a clear timeline, starting 36 hours ago. I note the critical context of post-operative recovery and bed rest, which sets the stage for possible substance withdrawal. She is presenting with both tactile hallucinations and physical signs like tremors and polydipsia, and severe hyponatremia and hypokalemia (medical). Her history reveals a long-standing polysubstance use problem: self-reported alcohol use (""4 or 5 beers a day,"" which is likely minimized), 15 years of Klonopin use (illicitly obtained now), and ER visits positive for alcohol, benzos, opiates, and amphetamines. The surgery and bed rest are likely a *precipitating* event by interrupting her access. Her social situation involves isolation and lost relationships.

2.  **Diagnostic Reasoning:** My primary concern is acute withdrawal. The 36-hour timeline fits for both alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal, particularly considering the intermediate-long half-life of Klonopin. The ""bugs"" are specific and a key symptom, along with the tremors and electrolyte imbalances.

    *   **Diagnosis 1: Alcohol Withdrawal with Perceptual Disturbances (F10.232).** This is the leading diagnosis. She has clear criteria for Alcohol Use Disorder (tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, attempts to cut down). The formication is a key element of the perceptual disturbance, *not* full delirium (she seems oriented to time/place), which would be coded F10.231. She is at 36 hours, which is a bit early for full DTs, but well within the hallucinosis timeline.
    *   **Diagnosis 2: Benzodiazepine Withdrawal (F13.232 - with perceptual disturbances or F13.23).** Fifteen years of daily Klonopin is significant. Withdrawal here is likely *concurrent* with the alcohol withdrawal, but is also distinct. Her symptoms overlap, adding to the complexity, but benzos are an independent etiology.
    *   **Diagnosis 3: Substance Use Disorders.**
        *   **Alcohol Use Disorder, Severe (F10.20):** I need to list this separately, the chronic condition, even though the primary diagnosis is the withdrawal. ICD-10 coding typically includes the withdrawal code and the use disorder.
        *   **Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder, Severe (F13.20):** The Klonopin history (long term, illicit) makes this a clear diagnosis.
        *   **Opioid Use Disorder / Stimulant Use Disorder:** The ER history is positive. The ""online dispensary"" is a huge red flag for contaminated pills (fentanyl and methamphetamine). Based on this history, I'm going to include these despite denials, as repeated ER visits suggest an entrenched pattern.
    *   **Diagnosis 4: Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder.** This *could* be considered, but withdrawal with perceptual disturbances is the priority unless the psychosis is *far* beyond what is expected. The ""bugs"" are hallmark withdrawal.
    *   **Diagnosis 5: Unspecified Opiate/Stimulant Use.** The positive tox screens (opiate and amphetamine) from ER visits makes me consider this. We have a Use *History* at a minimum, likely mild-moderate. I will list *Use Disorders*, not ""Abuse"" to map with ICD-10.

3.  **Refining & Prioritizing the Top 5:**

    *   I'll stick with Alcohol Withdrawal as the acute driver and the primary code.
    *   I will include Sedative Withdrawal for the Klonopin withdrawal.
    *   Given the history, I will list the alcohol and sedative *use* disorders as well, for the chronic conditions.
    *   Positive tox screens make me lean towards stimulant *and* opioid use/dependence.
    *   I'm also considering electrolyte imbalance-caused delirium, but the timing is *primarily* about withdrawal.

    **My Final Top 5 Diagnoses are:**

    1.  **Alcohol Withdrawal with Perceptual Disturbances (F10.232):** This captures the acute presentation and symptom of formication.

1007,"Collin is a 71 year old man, with remote history of alcohol use disorder, but has been sober for about 6 years. He used alcohol heavily from about 28 years of age to 65 years of age, acknowledging multiple inpatient medical hospitalizations for acute alcohol withdrawal as well as medical complications due to alcohol use, including acute liver failure and subsequent permanent gait abnormalities. He has come to his PCP with his wife reporting, “my family thinks I’m changing.” The wife interrupts the patient and states “you are changing, Collin.” The wife discloses that the patient wandered out of the house into the cold 3 times over the past month, and in the middle of the night. The wife states “I found him outside at about 2 a.m., it was 4 degrees outside and he was in his boxers, just standing there.” The patient himself recalls his wife bringing him inside, but can’t recall going outside. A recent CT scan in the local emergency room indicated no acute abnormalities or indication of stroke. The wife goes on to say, “Collin used to love cooking for the family, but now he can’t find his way around the kitchen”, stating the patient forgets to turn the burners off on the stove and even causes a fire in the kitchen a couple of months ago. The wife reports the family started noticing these changes about 2 years ago. There is no family history of dementia, Parkinson’s or Huntington’s disease. There are no known falls. Collin ultimately discloses “I do feel depressed these days”, reporting a worsening of sad and depressed mood starting about 2 years ago. He endorsed low motivation, anhedonia, and has even had passive suicidal thoughts over the past month. He denied any recent stressors, and denied returning to drinking alcohol or any drug use. Collin’s wife states, “he gets angry of the smallest things.” She goes on to say, “I have to help him get to the bathroom because he is incontinent in the bed very night now”, stating she also has to bath the patient because he can’t find his way around the bathroom. Finally, Collin’s wife states “he goes around making things up when we get around family, sometimes just inventing stuff on the whim, like saying he is making additions to the house or buying a new car, when that is both not true and has nothing to do with the conversation.",Alcohol induced Korsakov’s Syndrome (F10.26); Persistent depressive disorder (F34.1),,judah_weathers,,,,"**Final Diagnoses: The Expert's Perspective**

Okay, here's the final list of diagnoses, carefully considered:

1.  **Alcohol-Induced Major Neurocognitive Disorder, Amnestic-Confabulatory Type** (F10.27). This seems the most fitting primary diagnosis. Given the significant history of heavy alcohol use, coupled with the hallmark symptom of confabulation (inventing stuff, which screams Korsakoff’s), and supported by gait abnormalities and the history of liver failure, this presents the strongest clinical picture, despite the timeline being slightly off. The explicit mention of confabulation is a *very* strong clue in these scenarios. It highlights the direct link between past alcohol use and the presenting cognitive impairments.

2.  **Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Severe** (F32.2). The patient presents with classic depressive symptoms: a depressed mood that's worsening and started around the time cognitive decline was noticed, low motivation, anhedonia, and, crucially, passive suicidal thoughts. These symptoms warrant a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, and the suicidal ideation demands a “Severe” specifier. It is possible the depression is a consequence of the NCD or has other comorbidities.

3.  **Alcohol Use Disorder, Severe, In Sustained Remission** (F10.21). This is included to specify the patient's history. It's important to document the past alcohol use, which is critical to understand the current neurological presentation. While the code for alcohol-induced dementia implies a history, this specifically marks the sustained abstinence.

4.  **Major Neurocognitive Disorder due to Alzheimer's Disease** (F00.1). Despite leading with Alcohol-Induced NCD because of the prominent confabulation, it is also highly likely the patient is developing Alzheimer's disease. The “family thinks I'm changing” is a classic sign of insidious onset, and the progressive functional decline over the past two years fits. This diagnosis acknowledges that the patient's cognitive decline is likely multi-factorial, with the alcohol history increasing the risk or contributing to the early clinical presentation. A mixed etiology. The confabulation/gait abnormalities could be exacerbated by AD or a combination. The progression is key.

5.  **Personality Change Due to Another Medical Condition** (F07.0). This diagnosis captures the behavioral changes observed, specifically the irritability and anger the patient’s family reported (""angry at smallest things""). This is likely part of the alcohol-induced frontal changes, and potentially is a manifestation of the neurocognitive disorder. The fact that the change in personality is a major concern from the family adds specificity.

Okay, here's how I'm approaching this: The user wants a structured list of five psychiatric diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes, and they are expecting my expert-level analysis of a clinical vignette. I need to deliver *only* the list, but my internal process has to be thorough, matching my high standard for diagnostic accuracy.

First, I extracted the key data points from the clinical vignette. I'm focusing on the chief complaint (""abrasive attack on my life,"" fear, harassment), substance use history (heavy drinking since age 12, recent increase, withdrawal symptoms), psychotic symptoms (delusions of harassment, auditory hallucinations, thought insertion), mood symptoms (history of depression, current depressive symptoms, history of mania with hospitalization), trauma history (acknowledged, with symptoms like flashbacks), and medical history (pancreatitis). The user will be expecting me to apply Level 5 rigor for the analysis of the data.

Next, I'm working through a differential diagnosis. The clear history of a manic episode requiring hospitalization two years ago strongly suggests Bipolar I Disorder. This is the first and likely primary diagnosis. The current presentation includes both depressive and psychotic symptoms, which are, therefore, ""current episode depressed, with psychotic features"".

The alcohol use is a complicating factor. The patient has a clear history of Alcohol Use Disorder with heavy use since age 12, recent increase, and withdrawal symptoms, including a remote seizure. The onset of auditory hallucinations two weeks ago, coinciding with the attempt to cut back on alcohol, strongly suggests Alcohol-Induced Psychotic Disorder or Alcohol Withdrawal with Perceptual Disturbances.

However, the nature of the hallucinations (""voices of old people"") and the presence of thought insertion are more complex and are also consistent with the possibility of Bipolar Disorder with Psychotic Features. The ""abrasive attack"" and paranoid ideation is a complex delusion that might reflect Bipolar or other disorders.

Additionally, the trauma history and related symptoms (flashbacks, nightmares, hypervigilance, avoidance) strongly suggest Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.

Therefore, I'm considering multiple diagnoses:

1.  **Bipolar I Disorder:** The history of mania and the current mood/psychotic symptoms make this the primary mood disorder. The ICD-10 code is F31.5 (Bipolar I Disorder, current episode depressed, severe, with psychotic features).
2.  **Alcohol Use Disorder:** Given the prolonged heavy drinking history, pancreatitis, and withdrawal symptoms, F10.20 (Alcohol Use Disorder, Severe) is the appropriate code.
3.  **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder:** The trauma history and symptoms warrant this diagnosis, coded as F43.10 (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder).
4.  **Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type:** This is a differential, particularly if the psychosis persists independently of the mood episode. F25.0 (Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type) is used.
5.  **Alcohol-Induced Psychotic Disorder:** Given the temporal relationship between alcohol reduction and the onset of hallucinations (and thought insertion), F10.251 (Alcohol-induced psychotic disorder with hallucinations) seems appropriate. If I used F10.239 (alcohol withdrawal with perceptual disturbances), I would suggest a less complex or less delusional presentation.

I am concluding that the patient is presenting a clinical picture of Bipolar I Disorder (depressed episode with psychotic features) which is complicated by an Alcohol Use Disorder and symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. It is, therefore, also necessary to note the competing etiology of the psychosis, which could be an Alcohol-Induced Psychotic Disorder, especially if it persists and is not related to the current mood episode. Schizoaffective Disorder is a strong rule-out. I have a firm order of the final list. I am ready to generate the list for the user.

1009,"Erin is a 16 year old girl that was brought to her pediatric for a routine health exam. Erin is a sophomore at the local high school, plays lacrosse and does ballet at the local arts theatre. Erin reports that she has had no problems with depressed, sad or hopeless mood symptoms, and denied problems with excessive worry or panic. She lives at home with her two mothers, older brother and their dog Fiji. The patient does report that she goes to the gym for about 3 hours each day of the week, during which she does about 2.5 hours of cardiovascular training. She states she skip lunch on most days, has a sliced apple for breakfast, and take her dinner to her bedroom to slowly eat the vegetable portion of dinner (only) over a period of about 3 hours. Menarche was at age 13.5, but she has missed 3 of her last periods. She reports a lot of gastric reflex, and its wakes her up at night time.

As an expert psychiatrist, my thought process is as follows: I began by meticulously analyzing the request and understanding my role, the standard (DSM-5-TR), and the expected level of sophistication in my response. I then delved into the clinical vignette of Erin, a 16-year-old female, extracting key data points regarding her demographics, living situation, mental status, behaviors, and physical symptoms.

I recognized several core psychopathological elements: severe caloric restriction, excessive exercise, ritualized eating behaviors, and a likely body image distortion, although that wasn't explicitly stated. From there, I moved into formulating a differential diagnosis.

My primary consideration was an eating disorder. Anorexia Nervosa (AN) emerged as the leading possibility. Erin's severe caloric restriction (<1000 calories/day), excessive exercise (3 hours/day), and amenorrhea strongly pointed towards this diagnosis. However, her laxative use, even if described as for ""constipation,"" indicated the **Binge-eating/purging type** (F50.02) *of* Anorexia Nervosa, *more so than* the Restricting type (F50.01) (as DSM-5 indicates ANY purging behavior with AN is AN-BP, even if there aren't objective binges). If weight was in the normal range, the code would be for OSFED, or Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (Atypical AN) (F50.89), but amenorrhea makes the presumption of low weight, and the diagnostic criteria for AN is met.

I considered Bulimia Nervosa, but there was no reported bingeing. I also ruled out ARFID (Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder) because the restriction was clearly driven by calorie counting and a focus on ""health/exercise"" (a drive for thinness) rather than sensory issues or fear of choking.

Secondary to the eating disorder, I considered comorbid conditions. I considered Obsessive-Compulsive Personality traits or OCD (F42), given the rigidity in her behavior (<1000 cal, 3 hours gym) and ritualized eating (3 hours to eat vegetables). She denied depression or anxiety, but the somatic symptoms (reflux, sleep disturbance) and control issues suggested some underlying anxiety that needed to be accounted for. While she denied ""worry"", these rituals can be classified as compulsions, and the rigid control can suggest anxiety. I also considered Body Dysmorphic Disorder (F45.22) in the context of ballet and lacrosse but recognized that this is a common comorbidity.

Based on this analysis and the requirement for a differential diagnosis and ICD-10 codes, my final ranked differential list is:

1.  Anorexia Nervosa, Binge-eating/purging type (F50.02)
2.  Anorexia Nervosa, Restricting type (F50.01)

She acknowledges that “none of my family talk to me anymore; I only had my girlfriend for support.",Borderline personality disorder (F60.3); Post traumatic stress disorder (F43.1),,judah_weathers,,,,"**Diagnostic Reasoning Summary**

Okay, here's the breakdown of my thought process in formulating this differential diagnosis. First, I meticulously extracted the key data points from the clinical vignette: demographics, chief complaint, history of present illness (with an emphasis on the suicidal ideation, trigger, and affect), psychiatric history, trauma history, and social history. I organized this information to construct a clear clinical picture.

Then, the diagnostic reasoning began. I started with **Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)** – this feels like the primary driver, given the frantic efforts to avoid abandonment triggered by the breakup, the unstable relationships (reflected in the family estrangement and the partner's statement that she is ""too much to handle""), recurrent suicidal behavior (frequent ER visits, past hospitalizations and plans for overdose), self-mutilating behavior (cutting since age 13), and affective instability (mood of ""pissed off""). The chronicity and intensity make BPD the likely underlying diagnosis.

Next, **Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)** emerged as a significant secondary diagnosis due to the clear history of exposure to actual threatened death/violence (sexual abuse, intimate partner violence), as well as the intrusion symptoms (constant flashbacks, nightmares), avoidance (avoidance of places), and arousal/reactivity (hypervigilance). The explicit description of the PTSD symptoms as ""constant"" strengthens this diagnosis.

Now, the complexities began. The vignette *denies* any recent problems with appetite, energy, motivation, or anhedonia. While chronic suicidality is stated, diagnosing a Major Depressive Episode now would be a mis-read of the text, so the diagnosis is a tricky one. Given this denial of typical MDD symptoms, I considered the denial carefully and I still believe there is a mood disorder. Given her chronic low mood, suicidal ideation and the long history, I then landed on **Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)** as a strong possibility, but I'm being mindful that the text is the only data source. While the patient denies a recent MDE, the underlying chronic dysphoria seems to be there given the constant cutting/hospitalizations. I'm noting in my internal reasoning the ""pissed off"" mood fits a mood disturbance.

I had to consider alternatives, such as **Adjustment Disorder**, but that felt insufficient given the chronicity and severity. **Suicidal Behavior Disorder** came to mind, given the history of suicidal ideation and past attempts, but that wasn't the primary focus here. I'm stuck with the ICD-10 F-codes.

Then, I looked at the history. I considered **Dependent Personality Disorder (DPD)**, given the reliance on the girlfriend and the acute suicidal response to the breakup. The intense emotional reaction and distress at the partner leaving points to the dependent traits.

I noted the hypervigilance and considered a **Generalized Anxiety Disorder** diagnosis given the constant state of alarm, and I've selected **Unspecified Anxiety Disorder** as the fifth one. 

I'm keeping in mind that these patients can be complex, so comorbidities are common.

So, in the end, after all the deliberation:

1.  Borderline personality disorder - F60.3
2.  Post-traumatic stress disorder - F43.10
3.  Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) - F34.1

Alright, let's break this down. As a seasoned psychiatrist, my mind immediately jumps into the familiar framework: DSM-5-TR, ICD-10 codes, and a structured approach.

I need to synthesize this clinical vignette, extract the critical data, and apply my diagnostic reasoning to formulate the top five diagnoses with associated F-codes. It's a precise exercise in clinical judgment.

So, here's how my mind processes the information: I start by building a mental map. I categorize the information into demographics, presenting problem (overdose with a fall), substance history, psychosocial factors (marital stress, professional decline), neurovegetative symptoms, medical/neurological data (that expanding subdural hematoma is definitely concerning), medication history, and past psychiatric history (thankfully, no mania, psychosis, or trauma).

The history screams Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The anhedonia, hypersomnia, fatigue, weight loss, cognitive difficulties, and mood lability (crying) all meet the criteria, even if he denies hopelessness. I note that he's been taking Cymbalta for five years. That means that this is most likely a recurrent, severe episode. The ""overdose"" adds another dimension to this case.

Next, I assess the substance use. The multi-decade history of heavy alcohol use, recent sobriety, relapse, and intoxication at the time of the event all point to Alcohol Use Disorder, and based on the history, it is severe. The recent relapse and need for rehab is a strong indicator.

Then, there's the medication. The overdose is concerning: 10mg of Klonopin. While he claims it was for sleep, that's not the point. This misuse suggests a Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder, again, I would assess it as Severe. At minimum, there is a Sedative Intoxication. It's an acute event that can't be ignored.

Then, the bleeding in the brain. The expanding subdural hematoma is a major organic factor. The cognitive deficits could be depression or neurocognitive disorder. I'm going to set it aside. I will note the overlap, as there's a possibility of a mood disorder due to another medical condition. I'll need to monitor this, but I'll focus on the primary diagnosis first.

Next, I'm thinking about personality pathology. I consider the marital discord, with fear of abandonment. Are we looking at Borderline or Dependent traits? It's possible but I have too little information. I will move on.

Now, let's reassess. I am thinking of a suicide attempt. He denies suicidal ideation, but I cannot deny a possible *intentional self-harm*. I'm going to code this as the condition: MDD, Alcohol Use Disorder, and Sedative Use Disorder.

With this synthesis, it's time to refine the list of the top five diagnoses. I'm going to look up the F-codes to ensure accuracy:

1.  Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe - F33.2
2.  Alcohol use disorder, severe - F10.20
3.  Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, severe - F13.20
4.  Alcohol intoxication - F10.129
5.  Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication - F13.129

I am happy with this list, with emphasis on the substance intoxication as he presented intoxicated and then had the fall. The MDD is the key, driving the whole event, and the other diagnosis are all related. The cognitive issues may improve with resolving the depressive episode, but the underlying alcohol use is concerning in an older patient. I will re-assess for cognitive issues later.

1012,"Melanie is an 11 year old girl who was brought to urgent care by her mother after being sent home from school for “using racial slurs.” Melanie is the product of a full-term, uncomplicated pregnancy, vaginally delivered with normal APGAR (Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration) score at birth. Melanie used her first word “Momma” around 48 months of age, and didn’t start noticing other children playing with her until about 6 years old. Even at 6 years old, Melanie would not respond to her name when called, often appearing like she was in a daydream, and would often do a lot of “rocking” or “spinning” when anxious. Melanie’s mother indicates “Melanie is a unique kid. She doesn’t really make good eye contact with me, her father or her friends, and seems to be overly focused on doing puzzles all day. She has a hard time making friends, because all she wants to do is work on puzzles, and does little interactive play with others.” Melanies mother also indicates “if we take her puzzle away from her for dinner, she will have a complete ‘meltdown’ and be inconsolable for a good hour, ultimately leading to us having to give her the puzzle back.” Around 8 years of age, Melanie was found blinking her eyes repeatedly, and would say “I have to do it” whenever family questioned the eye blinking. The eye blinking slowly went away, but seemed to be replace by Melanie contorting her neck repeatedly, and especially when getting ready for school or leaving the house. Now, Melanie slaps herself in the head repeatedly when stressed, to the point that family has to adorn Melanie with soft gloves so she does not cause injury. About 13 months ago, Melanie start screaming out racial slurs when in the grocery store and school, and this would last for about 5 minutes in duration, until she was able to calm down. Otherwise, Melanie denied problems with sad, depressed or hopeless mood, nor problems with auditory or visual hallucinations. Melanies mother denied observations of bizarre rituals such as excessive handwashing, counting or organizing, but does report Melanie has a strong and persistent interest in puzzles. Melanie denied active thoughts, plans or intents of harm to self or others.",Autistic Disorder (F 84.0); Tourette Syndrome (F95.2),"Medium given LLM would need to be able to know that Tourette syndrome (vs Tic disorder) can only be diagnosed with both motor AND vocal tics present for at least 12 month duration, which the patient has here.",judah_weathers,,,,"**Diagnostic Reasoning for Melanie (11-Year-Old Female)**

Okay, here's how I'm approaching this, stepping through the diagnostic process systematically. First, I've got the data from the vignette: demographics, developmental history, repetitive behaviors, tics, and associated features, all laid out. Based on my expert knowledge, I'm aiming for the most accurate and nuanced diagnoses.

I see this girl needs comprehensive assessment.

1.  **Primary:** **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)** is the cornerstone here. The developmental delays are very striking - speech at four, no social reciprocity until six. She demonstrates the classic deficits in social communication, like poor eye contact, the difficulty making friends and reduced interactive play. She clearly has restricted, repetitive behaviors: the rocking, the puzzle obsession, the meltdowns with routine disruption, and the concerning self-injurious behavior. I'd definitely assess severity, keeping in mind her language difficulties. The DSM code is F84.0.

2.  **Secondary:** **Tourette's Disorder** is next. She has multiple motor tics (blinking, neck contorting, head slapping) and a vocal tic (the racial slurs). The timeline is important – the tics started around eight, and have persisted for over a year (since age 8). This clearly meets the criteria (F95.2).

3.  **Secondary:** Next, I'm making a call on the *specific* developmental challenges.  Although ASD captures some of this, I need to zoom in. The historical language delay is significant (""Momma"" at four). The social awareness delay until six reinforces this.  Language Disorder is most likely at this point based on that single data point. The alternative is **Intellectual Disability**, but I'm basing my decisions on the specific data given in the vignette. The DSM-5 requires that speech and language is *severely* affected to indicate that ID is the diagnosis. I'm going with F80.9, **Unspecified Language Disorder** to specify the language delay from the vignette information.  Although it is plausible, it is not possible to call this ID (F70-F79), without IQ scores and adaptive functioning data, which are absent in the vignette.  *However*, the language delay makes ID highly probable. Since this is diagnostic reasoning, I'm stating the high probability of ID. She has **Stereotypic Movement Disorder**. The rocking and spinning are repetitive.  But, the head slapping *is clinically significant* and requires gloves. Even though ASD accounts for some repetitive behaviors, DSM-5-TR states that if self-injury is present and clinically significant, we diagnose both.

4.  **Secondary:** Next, I considered ADHD and Anxiety, but nothing in the data explicitly points to those, so the next diagnosis is an important one. Based on the global delays, I'm recommending **Unspecified Intellectual Disability** (F79). The language delay, and the cognitive delays, strongly supports the choice. The fact that the patient has such a late first word, suggests F70-F79, but I'm going with F79 for the specific diagnosis, since I don't have enough data to support the severity.

5.  Finally, I considered anxiety.  ""Rocking or spinning when anxious."" But, the vignette doesn't give clear information on generalized anxiety versus the internal anxiety from ASD. There are not diagnostic criteria (per DSM-5). I can see the argument for it. The patient is anxious. But, the 5th diagnosis needs to be more specific. I see the delay, and I know that it needs to be specified. The text provides a hard data point that this child was delayed in language. Based on the text, **Language Disorder** (F80.9 or F80.2), is a likely diagnosis. The anxiety-related behaviors are secondary.

I've re-evaluated these diagnoses several times, particularly weighing the nuances of the ASD, Tourette's, Stereotypic Movement Disorder, and considering the likely co-morbidities. I believe this provides the most comprehensive and clinically relevant set of diagnoses, based on the provided information.

Here are my top five, coded:
1.  Autism Spectrum Disorder - F84.0

Ben’s father indicates the Ben has been without any recent infections or sick exposures, and is up-to-date on immunizations. Ben’s father does recount that “Ben looks very different from our other children. His eyes seem to be space father apart, and his ears look much lower than his siblings when they were babies.” Ben’s father also indicates, “we have a hard time leaving him alone for more than 1 minute before he starts crying loudly; his cry sounds very much like a cat.” Ben was born at 4 lbs 5 oz and had to spend about 1 week in the neonatal intensive care unit for what Ben’s dad reports was “something to do with his heart; it was the wrong shape or something.” Ben has had to meet with a pediatric gastroenterologist since birth for problems related to feeding. Ben’s father reports they met with a geneticist about 2 weeks ago, and they are awaiting the results from that testing.

While this diagnosis can be made with the aforementioned clinical signs, confirmation is typically done by genetic testing, which is yet to be determined here.",judah_weathers,,,,"**My Diagnostic Process: A Deep Dive**

Okay, here’s how I'm approaching this infant case, keeping my expert hat firmly on. First, I analyzed the request: I’m acting as a psychiatrist, tasked with diagnosing a clinical vignette using the DSM-5-TR, level 5 data extraction and diagnostic reasoning. The crucial part: the output must be a structured list of the top five diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes—strictly psychiatric or neurodevelopmental. No reasoning allowed, just the final product.

I started by absorbing the details of this 12-month-old, Ben. The father's concerns about his unusual appearance (hypertelorism, low-set ears), that distinctive cat-like cry, and heightened separation anxiety immediately jumped out. The low birth weight, NICU stay, and cardiac issue (""wrong shape,"" fixed split S2) are significant, and the feeding difficulties demand attention. The examination revealed hypotonia, drooling, microcephaly, and micrognathia—a pretty compelling cluster of findings. Genetics are pending, but I’m mentally already on that path.

Data extraction is key. I’m zeroing in on those symptoms: the cat-like cry is the absolute hallmark, the low birth weight and microcephaly are telltale signs, then the facial dysmorphia and cardiac issue and feeding issues – they form a very recognizable pattern. Bingo: Cri-du-chat syndrome. Textbook. This is the likely driving etiology.

Now, translating this genetic syndrome into *DSM-5-TR psychiatric/neurodevelopmental diagnoses* is the challenge. It’s important to remember that I need the psychiatric/neurodevelopmental codes, not just the underlying medical genetic diagnosis (Q93.4) which isn't the scope.

*Diagnosis 1: Global Developmental Delay.* At 12 months, this is the most accurate diagnostic label. The hypotonia, feeding issues, microcephaly, and genetic syndrome features universally result in severe developmental delay. The ICD-10 F-code? F88.

*Diagnosis 2: Unspecified Intellectual Disability.* While GDD is more precise under age 5, this is a plausible placeholder, or the logical next differential, especially if the condition is ""established"" but severity isn't yet quantifiable. I'll include it.

*Diagnosis 3: Other Specified Neurodevelopmental Disorder.* Given a known genetic condition (5p deletion), this is my way of capturing the neurodevelopmental sequelae.

*Diagnosis 4: Separation Anxiety Disorder.* I’m keeping this in the differential. While normative at this age, the father's specific worry suggests it might be excessive. I need a valid diagnostic code to list here.

*Diagnosis 5: Rumination Disorder / Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID)* The feeding difficulties plus GI consults lead me here. It is important to distinguish the cause of the feeding issues as organic (dysphagia) or behavioral. ARFID is the diagnosis for the failure to thrive or significant nutritional problems. I'll make this my priority code here.

*Diagnosis 6: Unspecified Mental Disorder due to Another Medical Condition.* I could use this to capture the behavioral manifestations linked to the genetic syndrome. However, I want to refine this list.

To refine the top 5, I am going with:

1.  **Global Developmental Delay (F88):** The most accurate for a 1-year-old.
2.  **Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (F50.82):** I am using this code as it captures both the DSM-5-TR diagnosis and the feeding issues with F50.82.
3.  **Separation Anxiety Disorder (F93.0):** Based on the father's specific concern.
4.  **Unspecified Intellectual Disability (F79):** The inevitable outcome of Cri-du-chat, though GDD is preferred.
5.  **Unspecified Neurodevelopmental Disorder (F89):** Captures CNS involvement if GDD is too specific.

I’m meticulously checking my ICD-10 F-codes: F88 for Global Developmental Delay, F50.82 for ARFID, F93.0 for Separation Anxiety, F79 for Unspecified Intellectual Disability, and finally, F89 for Unspecified Neurodevelopmental Disorder.

The ""cat cry"" is a neurological sign, but I keep remembering that the cry points to the syndrome. It is the syndrome that is the *cause* of the GDD.

After rechecking, the final codes are:

1.  Global Developmental Delay - F88
2.  Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder - F50.82
3.  Separation anxiety disorder - F93.0

The patients complaints were corroborated by his mother who was also in attendance for the appointment.",Hallucinogen persistent perception disorder (F16.983),Easy,judah_weathers,,,,"**Diagnostic Reasoning Process: Expert Perspective**

Okay, let's break this down systematically. The clinical vignette describes a 23-year-old male presenting with persistent visual disturbances – ""static,"" trails, halos – that started four years ago after heavy use of ""mushrooms."" This strongly suggests a substance-related etiology. My initial thought is *Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder* (HPPD). I'll need to check the DSM-5-TR criteria thoroughly.

The patient denies active substance use, and the symptoms are clearly linked to past hallucinogen use. He doesn't report distress, but he *is* seeking care ""to make sure I'm ok,"" which indicates at least some level of concern. He has no other concerning symptoms that would suggest depression, mania, anxiety, psychosis, or trauma. His medical history is negative for any neurological conditions or trauma. Collateral information from the mother corroborates his complaints.

Given the symptom presentation and remote substance use, HPPD is the most likely diagnosis. The ""visual snow"" is a classic indicator. However, if the distress criterion is too strictly interpreted, then ""Other Specified Hallucinogen-Related Disorder"" or ""Unspecified Hallucinogen-Related Disorder"" will be strong differentials.

Now, let's consider the differential diagnoses. A *Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder* is plausible because of the visual hallucinations, but it's a less probable fit for the persistent nature and remoteness from active substance use. *Schizophrenia Spectrum* is highly unlikely due to the absence of other psychotic symptoms and the temporal link to the hallucinogen use. Other possibilities could include *Anxiety Disorder due to another medical condition* or *Illness Anxiety Disorder*, given the patient's desire for reassurance, but the primary symptoms are perceptual rather than somatic. ""Visual Snow Syndrome"" is a neurological condition but the prompt asks for psychiatric diagnoses, and the substance etiology is more likely. *Factitious Disorder* is always a theoretical possibility, but without evidence of deception, it's low on the list.

The patient is reporting *perceptual* disturbances linked to hallucinogen use.

LLM may ‘over diagnosis’ depression instead of adjustment disorder based on duration of symptoms.,judah_weathers,,,,"**My Diagnostic Journey: A Deep Dive into Collin's Case**

Alright, let's break this down. First, I have to ensure I'm wearing my psychiatrist hat and strictly adhere to the DSM-5-TR, with a particular focus on the Level 5 expectations. I need to make the *most accurate* diagnosis based on the presented information. Collin's case is a classic situation that needs careful consideration of timelines, stressors, and the presence of mixed symptoms.

My initial approach is to gather and organize the data. I've noted the relevant details like the patient's age, chief complaint of behavioral outbursts, acute onset (about a week ago), the stressors (father's job loss and impending move), and the full range of symptoms: sadness, anger, anhedonia, neurovegetative signs, and passive suicidal ideation. Crucially, I'm noting the exclusions too—no mania, psychosis, trauma, substance use, or obvious anxiety in the moment.

The core conflict jumps out: a rapid onset of depressive symptoms and behavioral issues tied to significant psychosocial stressors. I need to figure out which diagnosis fits best, and most importantly, how to prioritize the most *precise* one.

My first thought is **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)**. I quickly run through the criteria. Collin definitely has the symptom count needed, with depressed mood/irritability, anhedonia, fatigue, sleep disturbance, concentration issues, passive SI, and an appetite change. However, there's a duration problem. MDD requires symptoms for at least two weeks, and Collin's symptoms have only been present for one week. As such, the strict application of DSM-5-TR rules out MDD for the moment. But I'm also thinking clinically, and MDD is the likely trajectory.

Next, I look at **Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Disturbance of Emotions and Conduct**. This is the one that's looking the most compelling right now. The stressor is there, clear as day, and the symptoms, both emotional (sadness, hopelessness) and behavioral (kicking, destruction), perfectly fit the ""mixed disturbance"" subtype. The acute onset (within a week of the stressor) is another strong factor. It's the most appropriate working diagnosis at this point, but I must also consider all options.

Then, there's the provisional diagnostic possibility of a **Major Depressive Episode**. Clinically, this makes sense, especially given the severity, but the duration has to be strictly respected, which is why I’m hesitant to put this high on the list. If I must, I would have to use ""Other Specified Depressive Disorder"" to respect the duration.

I quickly check for other disorders that may fit, though they are ruled out by the specifics of this case. **Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder** and **Oppositional Defiant Disorder** are quickly dismissed because the timelines don't match.

My attention is brought back to **Other Specified Depressive Disorder**, specifically the ""Short-duration depressive episode"". This feels like a strong contender, since it explicitly accounts for depressive symptoms lasting less than two weeks, but has all the hallmarks of a major depressive episode. The clinical severity of the symptoms might lean in favor of this too, which makes it a very difficult choice versus the Adjustment Disorder label. But the fact that the stressor is present does mean that Adjustment Disorder is the most precise.

I also run through other possibilities, like Brief Psychotic Disorder (ruled out by history), Substance-Induced Mood Disorder (denied substance use), Bipolar Disorder (denied mania), but nothing seems relevant given the vignette.

Now, for ranking, based on the DSM-5-TR criteria and the prompt, this is what I'm thinking:

1.  **Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Disturbance of Emotions and Conduct (F43.25):** The best, given the acute onset, the stressor, and the mixed symptoms. This is the most accurate diagnostic choice to start.
2.  **Other Specified Depressive Disorder (F32.89):** The ""Short-duration depressive episode"" label gives respect to the timeline.
3.  **Unspecified Depressive Disorder (F32.A):** This would be my choice if the criteria were still unclear.
4.  **Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Moderate (F32.1):** I'm keeping this here because it’s a differential diagnosis to consider, and it would likely be the condition if it lasts another week.
5.  **Unspecified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder (F91.9):** The behavioral component if the mood is discounted.

I go back and double-check my work. I make sure the F-codes are correct and that I'm sticking to the DSM-5-TR strictly. And, oh, the

1016,"Patient is a 59-year-old female with an unassessed complex trauma history presenting with not-just-right sensations related to hair and bumps growing on her face that cause substantial distress, despite acknowledging that the hairs and bumps are not always physically present. To manage this distress, she keeps tweezers on her person at all times, checks mirrors every 30 minutes when at home, and avoids staying home for extended periods. She also exhibits contamination concerns manifesting as excessive handwashing (25+ times daily) and using barriers to avoid direct contact with ""unclean"" surfaces out of fear of contracting an illness. Patient believes that she must act on her physical sensations or contamination-related thoughts most of the time or the distress will persist. Patient also collects items like My Little Ponies and Trolls. She has filled her home, garage, basement, a rented warehouse, and now pays to store items in a neighbor's garage despite saying she has little to no money to pay for these expenses. She expresses strong attachment to these possessions, stating she would ""NEVER"" sell them, and has a history of repurchasing items she previously attempted to sell. Patient's medical history is significant for AIDS (diagnosed 2003, currently on Odefsey), and past surgical interventions following a car accident. Her psychological history includes previous diagnoses of PTSD and Bipolar Disorder (which she disputes). Current symptoms of a major depressive episode include anhedonia, restlessness, sleep disturbance (averaging 4 hours nightly), feelings of worthlessness, and difficulty concentrating. These episodes emerge roughly every few month. The patient denied symptoms of psychosis as well as symptoms related to higher than usual energy or goal-directed activity at any time in the past. She endorsed suicidal ideation without current plan or intent, rating likelihood of attempt at 1%.

Alright, let's break this down. As an expert, I need to methodically approach this clinical vignette. The prompt calls for a structured output: five top diagnoses, ICD-10 codes, and no reasoning. My task is clear: extract data, apply DSM-5-TR criteria, and provide precise diagnoses. I need to be efficient and accurate.

First, I meticulously extract the patient's presentation: a 59-year-old female. Key symptom clusters emerge: compulsive behaviors/obsessions centered on facial hair/bumps, significant hoarding behavior focused on collections, and current Major Depressive Disorder symptoms. Past history is crucial – especially the denied trauma and disputed bipolar diagnoses. The patient lives alone with limited support.

Next, data extraction leads to diagnostic reasoning. Hoarding Disorder is immediately apparent, with full criteria met – difficulty discarding possessions, significant clutter, and financial strain. ICD-10: F42.3. The compulsive behaviors scream Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. The ""not-just-right"" sensations coupled with contamination fears and behaviors like excessive handwashing and barrier use are classic OCD. However, the somatic ""hair and bumps"" concerns need a careful differential. There's a strong Body Dysmorphic Disorder angle (mirror checking, avoidance). I decide to lean towards OCD here. ICD-10: F42.2.

The patient meets criteria for Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent. The vignette describes distinct episodes. Mania is denied, and the history supports MDD. I decide on a moderate diagnosis given the suicidal ideation and functional impact. ICD-10: F33.1.

Now, the ""hair and bumps"" issue is where this gets tricky. While BDD is in the mix, the use of tweezers and the ""not-just-right sensation"" point strongly to Excoriation (Skin-Picking) Disorder. This is a Body-Focused Repetitive Behavior (BFRB). The patient is picking at bumps. The link to distress and the behavior itself warrants this as a distinct diagnosis, even with the overlap with BDD. ICD-10: F42.4.

However, the mirror checking every 30 minutes, and the avoidance behavior, is characteristic of BDD. The ""bumps"" *could* be the focus of BDD, but Excoriation is better explained by the tactile sensation of ""bumps,"" which is a BFRB. So, BDD is also present. ICD-10: F45.22.

The trauma history is important. However, the patient denies current distress, so PTSD is ruled out. Likewise, the denial of mania symptoms and the current vignette presentation contradicts Bipolar disorder.

I double-check all F-codes, the DSM-5-TR, and the clinical hierarchy. The final list, prioritized by impact and severity, is:

1017,"The patient is a 25-year-old male who presented with delayed responses and was vaping during intake. He currently works full-time managing his hot tub repair company and lives with his girlfriend. His medical history includes multiple substance addictions, particularly opioids (requiring Suboxone and later Methadone treatment), and previous diagnoses of OCD, ADHD, anxiety disorder, and depressive disorder. He reports a significant history of head trauma (8 concussions), one seizure episode while incarcerated, and multiple incarcerations for offenses including gun possession, burglary, and vehicle theft. His psychiatric medication history includes Adderall, Concerta, Zoloft, an unspecified antidepressant, and Trazodone. The chief complaint involves symptoms that began at approximately age 18 during his first incarceration and have intensified in the past year, coinciding with work stress. Problematic behaviors include arranging items in specific places with extreme rigidity (unable to buy new items that don't have a ""place""), performing rituals in sets of three, and a specific handwashing ritual. He experiences intrusive thoughts about harming others (particularly fears of stabbing, shooting, or raping strangers) and engages in compulsive behaviors (brushing his hand from hairline to ear three times) to alleviate associated anxiety. He also reports persistent checking behaviors due to memory doubts, a need for things to feel ""just right"", and specific ordering rituals. Additionally, he endorses current anhedonia, decreased appetite, fatigue, and concentration difficulties that wax and wane every few months. He shared that these symptoms are distressing, though mildly impairing in his social, work, and leisurely activities. He denies current suicidality, self-harm, or hallucinations/delusions. He reports a childhood history of conduct problems (skipping school, lying, stealing, fighting) and adult behaviors including illegal activities, irresponsibility, deceitfulness (e.g., using fake identifications) and reported guiltlessness after harming others or damaging property. His childhood conduct problems (e.g., fighting) have resulting in the concussions reported in the medical history, and his illegal activities have resulted in two incarcerations. When asked about one such activity (stealing a car), he reported no remorse, instead blaming the victim for calling the police. The assessment revealed that these behaviors have continued for years in multiple settings, though as of late, he reported that he has not engaged in any illegal activities because he does not want to return to jail for a third time.","Obsessive-compulsive disorder, fair insight (F42.2); Recurrent Major Depressive Disorder (mild) (F33.0); antisocial personality disorder (F60.2)",,brian_zaboski,,,,"**My Diagnostic Thought Process**

Alright, let's break this down. As an expert, I need to methodically approach this clinical vignette. The prompt dictates a specific format: a numbered list of top five diagnoses with F-codes, no reasoning allowed. So, it’s all about rapid, yet precise, synthesis.

First, I review the task and rubric: Expert Psychiatrist, Level 5 Data Extraction and Reasoning. This means I'm expected to grasp the nuances and provide differential diagnoses. I scan the vignette quickly, noting key data: age, presenting complaints, history, and substance use. This initial pass is about gathering the raw facts.

Next, it's about deep data extraction. I meticulously pull out the pertinent clinical details, mentally categorizing them: *Demographics, presentation, HPI (symptoms and course), Past psychiatric and substance history, medical/neurological information, and forensic/conduct history.* The delayed responses and vaping raise immediate flags, but the HPI is where the critical diagnostic information resides. Intrusive thoughts, compulsions, and mood symptoms are the core of this assessment.

Then comes the synthesis and differential diagnosis. The patient's obsessions (harm) and compulsions (checking, ordering, neutralizing) scream **OCD**. I need to differentiate from OCPD (which is ego-syntonic), and psychosis (ruled out by insight). The age of onset (18) is relevant for this.

Next, I see the childhood conduct problems and adult history of illegal activity, deceit, and lack of remorse. The diagnosis of **Antisocial Personality Disorder** is readily apparent. The history confirms this meets criteria.

The opioid history is undeniable and requires attention. Multiple addictions and requiring Suboxone or Methadone make **Opioid Use Disorder** a key consideration. I’ll make a code choice based on the information provided, leaning towards ‘in remission’ as it’s implied the patient is undergoing treatment.

The ""waxing and waning"" mood symptoms (anhedonia, fatigue, appetite) lead me to a depressive disorder, which requires more thought. Since there’s a pattern of recurrence, **Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent**, feels like the most accurate choice, given that the pattern described fits a recurring episode. I need to rule out bipolar, but nothing suggests that.

Finally, the history of ADHD *with a previous diagnosis* and medication is significant. Despite the other complexities, the patient's impulsivity and concentration difficulties suggest a **Combined ADHD presentation**.

After arriving at these initial diagnoses, I consider relevant rule-outs. The history of concussions leads me to briefly think of a Neurocognitive Disorder. The multiple incarcerations and trauma are consistent with PTSD, but the symptoms presented are about harm done *by* him. And I am mindful of Substance/Medication-Induced and Nicotine Use Disorder, because of vaping.

I then refine and choose the most accurate codes from ICD-10-CM. *F42.2 for OCD, F60.2 for ASPD, F33.1 for MDD, F90.2 for ADHD, and F11.20 for Opioid Use Disorder (Severe, in Remission).* The final step is to arrange the diagnoses in order of clinical prominence. The chief complaint, followed by ASPD, and then the more active/current symptoms or conditions. I then check the codes again. I may consider the nuances of ICD-10-CM coding, such as which diagnoses are ‘principal’ or require modifiers. I then make a final polish, ensuring accurate terminology.

1018,"Patient is a 25-year-old transgender male currently living with parents who are reportedly non-supportive, and he works as a hospital lab technician. He presents with severe symptoms characterized primarily by intrusive thoughts related to morality, contamination, and harm. Unwanted thoughts include fears of transmitting sexual fluids to others (which he believes would make him ""a rapist""), concerns about accidentally killing insects, moral distress about consuming animal products, and beliefs that viewing violent media constitutes ""condoning"" violence. To manage these thoughts, he engages in extensive reassurance seeking, repeatedly checking lab results at work, avoiding video games and television, dietary restrictions, and some handwashing. He reports these symptoms significantly interfere with daily functioning, preventing him from living independently. They cause intense distress that frequently culminates in panic attacks. Patient has a complex history related to his gender identity, reporting he has identified as male throughout his life despite being assigned female at birth. He is currently taking low-dose testosterone but conceals this from his family, who he believes are interfering with his plans for gender-affirming surgeries. He reported childhood ""delusions"" about being ""from a fantasy world and chosen by gods"" that resolved by age 18. Patient previously took fluvoxamine for panic symptoms until approximately age 24, reporting significant symptom exacerbation upon discontinuation. He describes himself as introverted with limited social connections, identifying as asexual, though questioning if this might be avoidance related to triggering thoughts. His social anxiety dates back to middle and high school, when he was ""pretty much mute"" with few friends. Patient describes his mood as ""always a little depressed"" with recent intensification. He endorses feeling sad, empty, and hopeless most days, anhedonia, sleep disturbances, psychomotor retardation, fatigue, worthlessness, guilt, concentration difficulties, and suicidal ideation. He frequently believes he ""needs to be dead"" and that suicide would be ""the moral thing to do"" following morally repugnant intrusive thoughts, though he denies current plan or intent (estimating a 5% chance of suicide within three months). He struggles with activities of daily living without parental support and expresses frustration that his thoughts and behaviors interfere with his gender expression. Despite these significant symptoms, he demonstrates good insight, noting that his thoughts are not consistent with who he is and what he values.","Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder with good insight (F42.2); Gender Dysphoria in Adults, posttransition (F64.0); Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Moderate (F32.1)",,brian_zaboski,,,,"**My Diagnostic Approach**

Alright, let's break this down. First, I'm taking on the role of a psychiatrist, and the task is a diagnosis based on the DSM-5-TR, with this ACGME-based rubric as the guide. The focus is to come up with the most likely diagnoses, but I'm not going to include the reasoning in my output. The output will be a structured list of diagnoses, up to 5, with F-codes. It's important to stick to the information given and only use F-codes. No non-psychiatric diagnoses. Got it.

I'll start by extracting the key data. This is a 25-year-old transgender male, living in a non-supportive environment, working as a lab tech.

*   **Obsessive-Compulsive:** There are intrusive thoughts, mainly regarding morals, contamination, and harm. Then, compulsive behaviors like reassurance seeking, checking lab results, avoidance of media, and restrictive eating and hand washing. It's interfering with his independence and is clearly causing distress. He actually has “good insight,” which is a positive sign.
*   **Mood:** Seems chronically “a little depressed,” but now there's an intensification. The current episode includes a sad/empty/hopeless mood, anhedonia, sleep issues, psychomotor retardation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness and guilt, concentration problems, and suicidality.
*   **Anxiety:** Reports panic attacks, that seem linked to his obsessions. He was on fluvoxamine for panic until 24; now it’s back.
*   **Social/Developmental:** Social anxiety since middle school, few friends, now is introverted.
*   **Other:** Had childhood ""delusions"" that were resolved by age 18. There is some paranoia now, but that might be related to a non-supportive family and be reality-based.
*   **Gender Dysphoria:** He's identified as male his whole life. Distress about external influences on his gender expression. Currently secretly on testosterone.

Now the simulated diagnostic reasoning begins...

1.  **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD):** This seems primary. The obsessions are classic, causing significant distress and impairment. The insight is key. Code: F42.2 (Mixed obsessional thoughts and compulsive acts).

2.  **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** I'm seeing enough to meet the criteria: depressed mood, loss of interest, sleep problems, psychomotor retardation, fatigue, worthlessness, guilt, concentration problems, and suicidal ideation. Given the severity of suicidal ideation and functional impairment, this leans toward MDD. Code: F32.2. or F33.2. I'm going with F32.2 single episode.

3.  **Social Anxiety Disorder:** There’s a history, it's current. I think this is distinct from the OCD. Code: F40.10.

4.  **Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia):** The ""always a little depressed"" definitely signals this. Code: F34.1.

5.  **Gender Dysphoria:** This fits, given the incongruence, desire for surgery, and the distress. The diagnosis can allow for access to care. Code: F64.0.

Panic disorder is also considered, but I am going to lean toward the OCD first. Psychosis seems unlikely, and ASD doesn't jump out given the information.

I'm thinking OCD first, MDD second (because the patient’s symptoms are severe) then gender dysphoria for contextual clarity. Next, social anxiety, and then, dysthymia to capture that “always depressed” aspect.

I've got the final list:

1.  Obsessive-compulsive disorder - F42.2
2.  Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe without psychotic features - F32.2
3.  Social anxiety disorder (social phobia) - F40.10
4.  Gender dysphoria - F64.0
5.  Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) - F34.1

1019,"Patient is a 47-year-old female residing in the Northeastern United States who recently lost her job due to alleged ""disorganization"", which she contests as the actual reason for termination. Currently unemployed but financially stable for the near term, she is pursuing employment opportunities abroad with plans to relocate to Vietnam in September 2021. The patient lives alone with no local support system and has recently withdrawn from her social connections following concurrent stressors of job loss and the death of her pet cat, expressing irritation with friends' ""bad advice"". She denies substance use, maintains good physical health aside from requiring iron supplementation, and reports a childhood head injury at age 11 without loss of consciousness. Patient describes longstanding organizational tendencies dating back to approximately age 8, recalling precise block stacking and meticulous desk organization throughout her schooling. These behaviors were particularly pronounced during her high school years when her family sponsored relatives' citizenship, resulting in 16 people residing in her home. She demonstrates consistent contamination-related behaviors, including using barriers when touching public surfaces, frequent hand sanitization (predating the pandemic), and immediate cleaning of any perceived contamination. The patient engages in regular cleaning throughout the day, reporting an inability to tolerate ""a single dirty dish in the sink"" and an immediate need to address any uncleanliness she observes. Notably, she denies these behaviors cause distress or any impairment, stating she ""enjoys"" cleaning and maintaining organization.

Okay, here's my final assessment. Based on this clinical picture, and assuming I'm operating at the expert resident level, I've weighed a number of factors and considered multiple differentials. Here's my prioritized list of the top five most likely diagnoses with their corresponding ICD-10 codes:

1.  **Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder** (F60.5): This is the central diagnosis. The patient's long-standing pattern of perfectionism, orderliness, control, and interpersonal difficulties – highlighted by the ""enjoyment"" of cleaning – all strongly point to this personality disorder. The ""disorganization"" firing at work is likely due to the patient's perfectionistic tendencies, which impede efficiency, rather than a lack of competence, while the contestation of being fired represents a lack of insight.

2.  **Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Mild** (F32.0): The patient clearly meets the symptom and duration criteria for an MDE, and I am choosing this diagnosis as the primary mood disorder, even though the symptoms appear ""manageable"". There are five SIGECAPS symptoms present, for a two-week duration, including depressed mood, anhedonia, fatigue, worthlessness, and restlessness, along with significant social withdrawal.

3.  **Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood** (F43.21): This diagnosis is a critical alternative. If, upon further evaluation, the distress is deemed to be clearly within the ""manageable"" range and directly linked to the recent stressors (job loss, pet death), and does not meet the criteria for MDD, then this would be the correct diagnosis.

4.  **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder** (F42.2): The patient's contamination behaviors (barriers, sanitizing) warrant an OCD differential. While the patient denies distress and claims she ""enjoys"" these behaviors, the rituals are of clinical significance and merit an evaluation for possible ""poor insight"" OCD or comorbidity.

5.  **Unspecified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder** (F43.9): The patient acknowledges an ""extremely traumatic event,"" and while she denies re-experiencing symptoms of PTSD, she does exhibit irritability and social withdrawal. These symptoms may be trauma-related but do not fully meet PTSD criteria, therefore I choose this diagnosis over PTSD.

They describe their living situation as ""overwhelming"" due to parental boundary issues, though they maintain a supportive romantic relationship since 2019. Their psychiatric history includes diagnoses of MDD and GAD at age 15-16, PTSD in 2016 following emotional abuse by high school friends, and ADHD in 2018 (without neuropsychological evaluation). Current medications include Lisdexamfetamine 50mg (since 2018), various supplements, and a contraceptive injection. They previously tried multiple antidepressants (2011-2015) but discontinued each after approximately two weeks due to suicidal ideation and, in one case, motor disturbances. The patient consumes alcohol socially (3-5 drinks monthly) and has been vaping marijuana 1-3 times weekly for three months primarily to aid sleep and manage anxiety. The patient's primary symptoms onset around age 5 with intrusive visualizations of falling down stairs along with perfectionism through rewriting notes until they felt ""just right"". Currently, they experience significant distress when surroundings are not in the ""right spot"", spending up to 12 hours reorganizing belongings without breaks, which would cause severe distress if interrupted. This ""not just right"" feeling impairs their ability to meet deadlines, complete job applications, and fulfill social obligations. They also engage in checking behaviors when packing (counting socks repeatedly, checking for essential items) and experience distressing sexual intrusive thoughts.

Okay, let's break this down. First, I need to organize the data. We have a 24-year-old gender-fluid individual with a complex history. Initial impressions point to a significant overlap of diagnoses, which is going to require careful differentiation. The history of MDD, GAD, PTSD (2016), and ADHD (2018) all point to chronic psychopathology, alongside suicidal attempts and self harm. There's also the medication sensitivities. Substance use is present with alcohol and marijuana, though not currently appearing as primary drivers based on the information.

Now for the presenting symptoms. The *first* and most prominent cluster leaps out: the obsessive-compulsive symptoms. These include early onset (age 5) intrusive visualizations, perfectionism, “not just right” experiences, compulsive reorganizing that consumes a huge amount of time (up to 12 hours!), checking behaviors, and intrusive sexual thoughts. The impact is significant, leading to impairment in deadlines, job applications, and social functioning. This *must* be addressed.

Next, there is the skin-picking behavior, which is a key symptom cluster. The patient picks ingrown hairs until bleeding, scratches the neck and jaw, and tears cuticles. This worsens with anxiety, and the patient has failed attempts to stop it. This warrants a separate diagnosis in DSM-5-TR, as it is distinct from OCD compulsions driven by a specific obsession.

Then, we have the mood symptoms, which include passive suicidal ideation, anhedonia, decreased appetite, sleep difficulties, psychomotor agitation, worthlessness, and concentration problems. The history of MDD confirms this, but we need to remember the ADHD history as well.

The social anxiety is also significant. Persistent fear of judgment/rejection, rumination, and reassurance-seeking are impacting friendships. This can't be explained away by the OCD “not just right” feelings; it's a separate entity.

Finally, we have the eating-related concerns. A history of binge eating with rapid eating and feelings of disgust/embarrassment, followed by compensatory fasting (about three days). The frequency is reported to be less than once a week, and they state they haven’t engaged in it in the past two months.

Considering *all* this, here’s my top list. I'm going to follow the logic:
1.  **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)** is the primary focus. The clear obsessions and compulsions, the time commitment, the impairment... it's the elephant in the room. This needs to be actively managed, and I need a targeted strategy.
2.  **Excoriation (Skin-Picking) Disorder** is absolutely a concurrent diagnosis. It is distinct and causes significant impairment. It has failed intervention efforts.
3.  **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Recurrent, Severe** is the clear third. History of suicide attempts, passive SI, anhedonia, all make this clear. The diagnosis should reflect the severity of the symptoms to ensure the needed support.
4.  **Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)** also needs consideration, as the patient meets full criteria and the social fear is not secondary to the OCD.
5.  **Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (OSFED)**. This one needs deliberation. Bulimia Nervosa is possible, but the frequency is a barrier, though there's an impact. The history is recent, so it could reemerge. The specific binge/compensatory details are too specific to ignore. The patient is no longer *actively* binging (stated in the vignette).
    It might be tempting to put ADHD here, but the “without neuropsych eval” caveat and significant overlap with OCD makes me hesitant. The eating disorder pathology has enough granular description to warrant a diagnosis. The fact that the person has failed multiple times to stop shows it's not a single episode.

To make sure I'm precise, here are the ICD-10 codes:
1.  Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder - **F42.2**
2.  Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Severe - **F33.2**
3.  Excoriation (Skin-Picking) Disorder - **F42.4**
4.  Social Anxiety Disorder - **F40.10**
5.  Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder - **F50.8**

And there we go. That is the correct list, with reasoning.

1021,"The patient is an 18-year-old non-binary college freshman with a complex psychiatric presentation. They report a history of childhood anxiety, perfectionism, and ritualistic self-punishment behaviors starting in the third grade. Currently, their most debilitating symptom is anxiety about ""contaminated air"" when others cough or sneeze, prompting them to cover their face and hold their breath even when the trigger is far away or on television. They engage in checking and counting behaviors based on the number 3, including checking mirrors while driving, locking/unlocking their car, and tapping their toothbrush. These compulsions are experienced as uncontrollable, with the patient reporting they sometimes modify behaviors (like holding an imaginary door handle in their pocket) when the original compulsion would be disruptive. At approximately age 16, the patient developed anorexia nervosa, restricting their food intake and ultimately requiring intervention from parents and a treatment team. Despite gaining weight under external pressure, the patient continues to restrict eating, has a distinct fear of gaining weight, becoming fat, fasting until dinner, drinking coffee to intentionally upset their stomach. Their BMI currently falls within the normal range. Around the same time their eating disorder developed, the patient experienced depressive symptoms including hopelessness, low motivation, and self-harm behaviors (pulling hair, cutting, punching stomach). They had suicidal ideation during high school, including thoughts of jumping in front of a train and fantasizing about wandering into hallways during a school shooting. Current suicidal thoughts are less frequent and persistent. Current depressive symptoms have been subsyndromal (though not entirely absent) for about 7 months. Specifically, the patient currently denies experiencing depressive symptoms for more than a few hours every couple of weeks but rates their chance of self-harm in the next three months at 50% (suicide attempt chance at 0%). They report minimal alcohol and marijuana use. Notably, the patient expresses resistance to treatment, stating that ""getting better means getting fat"" and feeling they need to ""stay sad for a while longer"".","Obsessive-compulsive disorder (F42.2); Anorexia nervosa, restricting type, in partial remission (F50.014); Major depressive disorder, recurrent, in partial remission (F33.41)",,brian_zaboski,,,,"**My Diagnostic Thought Process**

Alright, let's break this down. First, I need to stay focused: expert psychiatrist role, DSM-5-TR, level 5 ACGME milestones (sophisticated extraction, nuanced reasoning, clinical expertise). This requires a structured top 5 list with ICD-10 F-codes, no fluff.

Now, the data extraction is key. I'm focusing on the clusters: OCD, Eating Pathology, Mood/Depression, Self-Harm/Impulse, and Personality/Temperament.

*   **OCD:** This is screaming ""classic OCD."" Contamination obsessions (air), checking/counting compulsions. Ego-dystonic. Textbook. I'm thinking F42.2 here.
*   **Eating Pathology:** The history is classic Anorexia Nervosa, restricting type. The *current* BMI is normal, which means, technically, this is ""Atypical Anorexia"" in DSM-5, an *OSFED* diagnosis. But, I think about the history. If they still have all the cognitions about weight gain and actively restrict, even with BMI in the normal range, the DSM-5 gives me ""Anorexia Nervosa, In Partial Remission,"" right? I can write F50.01 for that, which is restrictive-type. But I still need to be aware that F50.8 *could* be technically more accurate. I'm confident about F50.01 as a start.
*   **Mood/Depression:** Onset at 16, hopelessness, past suicidality, now subsyndromal. Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is my baseline here. Recurrent or Single? Single, unless there's an indication of prior episodes. In partial remission (F32.4).
*   **Self-Harm/Impulse:** Hair-pulling (Trichotillomania), cutting, punching. Hair-pulling is more than just NSSI; it's a specific comorbidity, given the OCD presentation. It is separate and fits neatly into the spectrum.
*   **Personality/Temperament:** Perfectionism, rigid self-punishment (OCPD traits). The need to ""stay sad"" gives me pause for *Borderline* but, for now, I'm sticking to the symptom disorders.

So, crafting this differential:

1.  **OCD (F42.2):** Most distinct. Most debilitating. Classic.
2.  **Anorexia Nervosa, Restricting Type (In Partial Remission) (F50.01):** History, current psychopathology (fear of fat, restriction, normal BMI with previous criteria met). The specifier is clinical, the F code will stay the same.
3.  **Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, In Partial Remission (F32.4):** Clear history, subsyndromal, fits the 16 year old timeframe.
4.  **Trichotillomania (F63.3):** Specific hair-pulling (distinct from general self-harm), and fits OCD.
5.  **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1):** Chronic childhood anxiety, perfectionism. Maybe BDD, but I think GAD's more fitting.

I'm reviewing the ED code again: Normal weight is the challenge, and I need to be exact here. F50.01 is what I am landing on for DSM. F50.8 would be *technically* more precise, but F50.01 describes the situation and provides more context.

The MDD code, F32.4, is better: single episode.

Refining OCD: F42.2 (Mixed) is correct with the obsessions and compulsions. Trichotillomania is in the right place, a comorbidity that warrants its own code.

I am not listing BPD because of the age of the patient (18) and a lack of support in the data.

GAD for number 5.

Okay. Time for the final list, polished and ready:

1.  Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder - F42.2
2.  Anorexia Nervosa, Restricting Type (In Partial Remission) - F50.01
3.  Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, In Partial Remission - F32.4

1022,"The patient is a 22-year-old female from the Southeastern United States with a history of Depression (2019), Anxiety (2019), and OCD (March 2021). She recently transitioned from working as a childcare specialist to self-employment as a freelancer. Her medical history includes anemia and IBS, for which she takes daily iron supplements. The patient previously attempted treatment with Zoloft (10mg) for OCD symptoms but discontinued due to emotional blunting effects. She reports consuming alcohol 1-2 glasses a few times monthly and using marijuana daily when available, which she finds helpful for intrusive thoughts despite occasionally triggering anxiety. The patient's most distressing symptoms involve intrusive thoughts about sexually harming children, accompanied by physiological responses that she describes as ""groinal"". These thoughts were particularly distressing during her work as a childcare specialist, where she engaged in compulsive staring at children's genital areas to ""prove"" she wasn't sexually attracted to them and sometimes avoided changing diapers due to fear of sexual arousal. After experiencing an intrusive dream about sexually harming her brother in January 2021, she experienced physical symptoms (shaking, freezing) when interacting with him and subsequently increased their time together as a form of reassurance. Additionally, the patient reports significant health anxiety focused on getting cancer, HIV, and STIs, leading to excessive symptom research. The patient experiences panic attacks (1-2 times monthly) lasting 15-30 minutes when triggered by intrusive thoughts, with symptoms including shortness of breath, crying, sweating, racing heart, chest pain, and feelings of detachment. She reports seeking reassurance from her mother when these thoughts become overwhelming. The patient also endorses distressing and functionally impairing social anxiety in small groups, leading to significant avoidance; however, she stated that this anxiety is primary due to her unwanted/intrusive thoughts rather than a fear of being judged. She reports experiencing over 50 depressive episodes in the past year, each lasting at least two weeks with symptoms including decreased appetite, sleep disturbance, fatigue, guilt, concentration difficulties, and thoughts of death. She described these episodes as challenging to manage, but ""not completely debilitating"".","OCD, mild, fair insight, with panic (F42.2); Illness Anxiety Disorder (F45.21); Major Depressive Episode, recurrent, moderate (F33.1)",,brian_zaboski,,,,"**My Diagnostic Approach**

Alright, let's break this down systematically. The instructions are clear: Expert Psychiatrist, DSM-5-TR, level 5 sophistication, just the diagnoses with F-codes, no reasoning. I'm presented with a 22-year-old female, freelancer, with a complex history. First, data extraction. I'm seeing a history of depression, anxiety, and OCD. Anemia and IBS are relevant, but not *psychiatric* primary diagnoses. Zoloft failed. Daily marijuana use, ""helpful"" but anxiety-triggering? Substance Use Disorder is a key consideration.

Now, the core symptoms, starting with OCD. Harm/sexual obsessions: child harm and incest themes, groinal response, compulsion to check/avoid, reassurance seeking. Then health anxiety: Cancer, HIV, STIs, excessive symptom research. Panic attacks are triggered by those intrusive thoughts (so not Panic Disorder alone), 1-2 times a month, with detachment. Social anxiety? Only due to the intrusive thoughts, so *not* Social Anxiety Disorder. The ""50 depressive episodes"" detail throws a red flag. Chronically depressed or rapid cycles, or hyperbole? Mathematically impossible for two-week-long episodes, so either chronic wax/wane, or the patient has rapid fluctuations. SIGECAPS criteria are met, so I need to go with MDD, Recurrent. Substance use is daily marijuana with negative psychological impact.

Now, the *reasoning*: OCD is screaming. F42.2 (Mixed obsessions and compulsions). MDD, I'm leaning toward F33.1 (Recurrent, Moderate), given the description. Panic attacks triggered *only* by the OCD, so Panic *attacks specifier*, not Panic Disorder. However, it *is* severe, and in a ""Top 5"" list, it's often included if the attacks are well defined as they are here. I will include Illness Anxiety Disorder (F45.21) because it’s a distinct health focus (Cancer, HIV). Daily marijuana use: F12.10 (Mild) for Cannabis Use Disorder.

Okay, let's step back. If it is only OCD, MDD, and substance use, what is the 5th diagnosis? What else is there? No personality disorder is evident. No specific phobia. I have MDD already. The patient's statement ""anxiety"" history. GAD? Maybe. But the key detail of panic triggered by *thoughts* means I *exclude* Panic Disorder alone. It is a level 5 process.

So, *Panic Disorder vs. specifier*: If I *must* provide 5 diagnoses, and cannot use non-psych codes, *should* I list Panic Disorder? The vignette *demands* five diagnoses. Based on the “anxiety” history I have GAD for that background anxiety (I'm leaning towards *GAD* now). *But I must also include the Cannabis.* I must retain Illness Anxiety!

Let's evaluate that ""Anxiety (2019)"" history. If the focus on health is separate from moral OCD, it serves as a valid secondary diagnosis. I will consider if this is *Generalized Anxiety Disorder* to capture any anxiety not entirely explained by OCD. The symptoms are high with shaking/freezing, the reassurance, and the vague, broad anxiety. The patient avoids, so, agoraphobia? It's often coded with panic (though I must be accurate). The patient denies fear of judgment in social settings, it is OCD. Agoraphobia is often coded with panic. I will lean back to Generalized Anxiety Disorder based on the ""Anxiety"" history and that background tension. The vignette asks for F-codes. Panic attacks are there (distinct).

So, now let me revise: OCD (F42.2) is the anchor. MDD (F33.1) is core. GAD (F41.1) is history-supported. Illness Anxiety (F45.21) is a distinct focus with behaviors. Cannabis (F12.10). Panic Disorder is too close with OCD.

Now let's review: is *50* really a description of chronic wax/wane depression? I cannot get Bipolar from the vignette. *Is it PMDD?* Maybe, but doubtful. 50 times in a year? Let's say it is what the patient is describing. I have the same list: OCD (F42.2). MDD (F33.1). GAD (F41.1). Illness Anxiety (F45.21). Cannabis (F12.10).

One last run: BDD (no). Separation Anxiety (no). I have the list.

1023,"Erik is a 10-year-old male who recently completed 4th grade in a gifted math program. He lives with his biological parents and seven-year-old brother, with whom he has ""constant"" conflict including arguing, screaming, and hitting. Erik has a developmental history of severe temper tantrums prior to age 4, with behavioral challenges emerging in kindergarten and worsening in subsequent grades. His mother reports that her son engages in ""constant defiance"", experiences rapid mood changes, and demonstrates impulsive behavior, including occasional incidents of pulling knives (though never pointing them at anyone). Daily arguments at home frequently escalate to physical aggression, particularly with his mother and brother. Erik has expressed statements such as ""I wish I could go to sleep and never wake up"" and reports feeling depressed ""randomly"" a couple times per month since second or third grade, though he denies daily depressive symptoms or changes in sleep or appetite. Erik's behavioral difficulties have manifested in both home and school environments. In school, he has engaged in speaking out of turn, refusing to follow directions, agitating teachers, and having ""screaming matches"" with staff. Despite these challenges, Erik maintains high grades across subjects (with math being his most difficult class at a B), has several friends, and is described as a leader in social interactions. He has a Section 504 plan that allows for movement opportunities and frequent breaks when needed. In March 2019, Erik began taking 2mg of Guanfacine (extended release) for attention/concentration deficits, which has helped reduce impulsivity and improve behavioral control, though aggressive and defiant behaviors have continued. His mother reports implementing a point system for rewards and consequences but notes limited effectiveness due to inconsistent expectations between parents. Formal assessment indicates that Erik demonstrates a pattern of emotional dysregulation, defiance, and aggressive behavior, with physical aggression occurring approximately every other day at home. Assessment also confirms prior symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, which are present across settings and contribute to emotional dysregulation and academic underperformance relative to ability.","Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Moderate (F91.3); Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Combined Type (F90.2)",,brian_zaboski,,,,"**Expert Diagnostic Reasoning: A Deep Dive**

Okay, here’s how I’m thinking through this clinical vignette. First, I’m clearly in the role of an expert psychiatrist, tasked with diagnosing a 10-year-old male, Erik, based on this provided clinical information, applying DSM-5-TR criteria. My goal here is a top 5 list of diagnoses with ICD-10 codes, at a Level 5 performance standard.

I start by extracting and organizing the key data points from the vignette. Erik is presenting with constant conflict, defiance, aggressive behaviors, and rapid mood changes. Developmentally, the severity of temper tantrums occurred prior to age 4. The challenges began in kindergarten, and are getting worse over time. I note the specific symptoms: constant defiance, arguments, speaking out of turn, refusing directions, agitating teachers, and ""screaming matches"". There is physical aggression, including hitting his brother, every other day, and notably, impulsively pulling knives. Rapid mood changes are present, along with passive suicidal ideation. He reports random feelings of depression. He has a history of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, present across settings, and he is being treated with Guanfacine ER for inattention/concentration. His academic performance is strong, but he is underperforming relative to his ability. He has friends, and is a leader, but parenting expectations are inconsistent. This history is going to factor into how I formulate the diagnoses.

Now, let's move into diagnostic reasoning. First, the symptoms of Inattention, Hyperactivity, and Impulsivity are evident. Given the history, the medication, and symptoms (speaking out of turn, movement needs, impulsive knife pulling), I immediately see this as ADHD, likely a Combined Presentation. ICD-10 Code: F90.2.

Next, I need to account for the Defiance, Argumentativeness, and Vindictiveness. The constant defiance, arguing, and refusal of directions point directly to Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), given the chronic nature since kindergarten. However, the physical aggression complicates this. ODD is primarily verbal aggression, while Conduct Disorder (CD) includes the physical. Here is where the vignette becomes trickier. I need to differentiate DMDD, ODD, Bipolar, and CD to determine the root. If the criteria for DMDD are met, that diagnosis will take priority over ODD. With these symptoms, DMDD is considered. But then, I check to see if he's *persistently* irritable or angry between outbursts, and the fact that he's successful and has friends, suggests ODD, since the irritability in DMDD is usually chronic. I need to re-evaluate the aggression, the frequency, is it reactive (as in, ADHD and ODD, impulsivity), or is it proactive? Conduct Disorder is less likely since this child is 10 years old with a temper and “tantrum” history, social successes, and “impulsive” knife pulling, rather than predatory. Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) needs to be considered, given the recurrent outbursts that are grossly out of proportion, but, given that, in children, IED and ADHD and ODD often co-exist and in such cases, ODD is often used as the primary formulation unless the symptoms are clearly IED in nature. I also need to rule out mood disorders: No clear signs of a major depressive episode and nothing to suggest a bipolar disorder. This leaves:

1.  ADHD is the neurodevelopmental driver. (F90.2).
2.  Now I need to differentiate ODD, DMDD, and IED.
    *   The mood swings and social successes points away from DMDD.
    *   The behavior fits ODD perfectly, but it doesn't fully capture the physical aggression.
    *   The IED does capture the explosive physical aggression that ODD doesn't cover.
    *   Clinically, severe ODD with physical aggression is the primary formulation alongside ADHD in a 10yo.
    *   But this vignette emphasizes ""emotional dysregulation"" repeatedly. ""Constant defiance,"" ""rapid mood changes.""
    *   I see: Unspecified Mood Disorder or DMDD, overlaid on ADHD.
    *   I choose the most accurate, strict fit here.

So, in strict terms: ADHD is definite. ODD is also definite. Is the aggression CD? No, it looks reactive. Is it IED? Possibly, but usually when ODD/DMDD don't fit well. Is it DMDD? No.

The most robust initial diagnosis is **ADHD Combined** and **ODD**, with further evaluation on the aggression.

I'm thinking about the ""emotional dysregulation"" in the assessment. This could point towards a mood disorder or DMDD. But since he doesn't have daily depressive symptoms, MD

His symptoms have included paranoid ideation, auditory and visual hallucinations, delusions (such as believing television was sending special messages), obsessive thoughts, compulsive behaviors, and periods of mania and depression. Dole holds a master’s degree in computer science and previously developed cybersecurity systems but resigned in 2019 due to unmanageable anxiety. He currently lives with his parents, who provide significant assistance with daily activities. Throughout his treatment history, Dole has demonstrated paranoid thoughts beginning at age 19, with recurrent episodes of acute psychosis requiring hospitalization. In 2018, he experienced hallucinations of messages on his phone, and in 2019, he reported seeing ""the devil"" and experiencing auditory hallucinations. He endorses unwanted/intrusive thoughts causing anxiety, which he attempts to neutralize with repetitive behaviors that take 1-3 hours daily. His symptoms include fear of harming himself, violent imagery, concerns about germs, and moral preoccupations. Dole reports deficits in procedural and episodic memory, impairing self-care and accurate recollection of past events. His family history is positive for paternal psychosis, depression with possible bipolar disorder, and a completed suicide. Intake impressions indicate that Dole has experienced (and continues to experience) delusions, hallucinations, disorganized/catatonic behavior, diminished emotional expression, and amotivation within a one-month period. He has exhibited delusions or hallucinations for at least two weeks in the absence of major mood episodes, and his functioning has decreased notably compared to his pre-symptom baseline.

Okay, here's my thought process as I've dissected this vignette. It's crucial to approach this like a level 5 expert, even if the final output is just a list. I'm focusing on data extraction and differential diagnosis, and following the rules laid out in the rubric.

First, I identified my role and the task: diagnosing a patient named Dole using DSM-5-TR, with ICD-10 codes. I need to keep the list concise and avoid irrelevant details, especially related to the historical diagnoses.

Analyzing the vignette, the key data points jumped out: Dole is a 31-year-old male with a long, complex psychiatric history, including multiple hospitalizations. The historical diagnoses are relevant, but the *current* symptoms dictate the most accurate diagnoses. I'm noting the previous diagnoses – Mood Disorder NOS, Bipolar, NPD, Schizoaffective, and Asperger's – but am using them as clues only, while focusing on the *presenting* symptoms.

I’ve gone through his recent presentation. The psychotic symptoms are pretty clear: paranoid ideation, auditory and visual hallucinations (including those concerning ""the devil""), and referential delusions (TV messages). This is not just a passing phase; there is a significant duration (since age 19, extensive history). The vignette explicitly states there have been “delusions or hallucinations for at least two weeks in the absence of major mood episodes”. That is the crucial distinguishing factor.

Mood symptoms are mixed: history of mania and depression, but the vignette specifically emphasizes the absence of major mood episodes during the current psychosis. It’s what differentiates Schizoaffective from other disorders.

Then, there are the OCD symptoms. I'm seeing intrusive thoughts (harming self, violence, germs) and the neutralizing behaviors (taking 1-3 hours daily) that are clearly causing distress and impairment. The ""limited insight"" further cements the OCD diagnosis.

Functional impairment is important. This guy resigned from his job and lives with his parents, who provide significant support. This points toward severe impairment, not simply a personality quirk.

Cognitively, he was high-functioning, with a Master's degree, but there's been a notable decline, including memory deficits. The Asperger's history is interesting, but ASD is the current diagnosis. This isn't just a matter of developmental background; his decline in functioning (procedural/episodic memory) is significant.

Finally, there’s the family history: paternal psychosis, depression/bipolar, and suicide. That helps inform my approach, but the clinical presentation must be the primary driver.

The diagnostic reasoning is where things get interesting. Schizophrenia comes immediately to mind because of the psychotic symptoms. But the key is that statement: ""delusions or hallucinations for at least two weeks in the absence of major mood episodes."" That pushes me towards *Schizoaffective Disorder*, given the history of mood episodes. The manic and depressive symptoms, when combined with the psychosis, point to the Bipolar Type, F25.0. It's the most encompassing diagnosis. Schizoaffective Disorder is the *best fit*, based on the criteria in the DSM-5-TR and the clinical picture.

The OCD is a straightforward, F42.2 Mixed Obsessional thoughts and compulsive acts. Obsessions (intrusive thoughts) and compulsions (neutralizing behaviors), are present, time-consuming, and impairing. The ""limited insight"" specifier makes this clear.

The Asperger's history and the need for support, despite his intelligence, clearly establish *Autism Spectrum Disorder*, F84.0. It is a long-standing developmental disorder and even though it is no longer called ""Asperger's"", the historical diagnosis guides its inclusion, given the long-term social challenges.

For anxiety, the job resignation from ""unmanageable anxiety"" is key. While some anxiety is OCD-related, there's likely a distinct component, leading to a diagnosis of *Generalized Anxiety Disorder*, F41.1. It is the best fit, because it captures the general anxiety and is distinct from the psychosis and OCD.

The fifth diagnosis is tricky. The ""disorganized/catatonic behavior"" needs a diagnosis. Given the context (intake notes), it seems clinically significant. In this case, ""catatonic behavior"" merits the diagnosis of *Catatonia associated with another mental disorder*, coded F06.1. Though it may be a specifier, it has a distinct ICD-10 code and merits inclusion.

I've carefully considered other possibilities: Social Anxiety Disorder (but GAD covers more); Unspecified Neurocognitive Disorder (ruled out at age 31 without organic factors); other personality disorders (NPD would only be valid with evidence). I've cross-referenced and confirmed the codes for accuracy.

1025,"Patient is a 32-year-old Black American male with no prior diagnostic history who presents with a chief complaint of ""uncontrollable staring, particularly at breasts/genitals"". The patient reports that this behavior began at age 27 (late 2017) and involves involuntary staring at people he does not know well, with particular focus on the genitals/breasts of all genders and ages, including children. He spends approximately six hours per day engaged in or thinking about this behavior, which he cannot control through willpower alone, though he can interrupt it by creating a physical barrier in his line of sight or wearing sunglasses. The patient initially denied but later acknowledged experiencing unwanted sexual thoughts regarding his sexual orientation. This behavior has significantly impaired his functioning, causing him to lose multiple jobs within the past year, avoid family gatherings, limit time in public, and experience relationship strain with his girlfriend of 12 years, with whom he has three children and now stays home while she works. The patient experiences moderate suicidal ideation, including thoughts that he would be better off dead, and reports feeling worthless and guilty, particularly about ""not providing for my children and for staring"". He describes his mood as ""iffy"" and notes increased irritability. While the patient endorsed panic attacks on assessment, follow-up questioning revealed these occur specifically when thinking excessively about his staring behaviors or unemployment, rather than occurring spontaneously. He also endorsed criteria for agoraphobia and social anxiety on screening, though these appear directly related to fears of being judged for his staring behavior. The patient acknowledged witnessing a traumatic event he chose not to disclose but denied re-experiencing or avoidance symptoms consistent with PTSD. Medical history includes hypertension treated with Amlodipine (dose unknown), with no psychiatric medication history reported.Throughout the assessment, the patient demonstrated limited insight into his symptoms, was guarded in his responses, and had not disclosed his problems to his long-term partner.

Okay, here's my considered assessment, drawing on my expertise and focusing on providing a structured list. I'm taking the clinical information piece by piece, as though I were the clinician on the case.

*   First, I'm zeroing in on the core issue: the ""uncontrollable staring."" This isn't just a simple behavior; it's *time-consuming*, *ego-dystonic*, and significantly *impairing*. The involuntary nature, the intrusive thoughts (especially about sexual orientation, even if initially denied), and the attempts at control (physical barriers) scream **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)**. The presentation sounds like a classic case of Ocular OCD or ""staring OCD."" I'm going with **F42.2** for this as a primary, as the symptoms fit ""Mixed obsessional thoughts and acts.""
*   Next, the mood and depressive symptoms. The vignette says it *doesn't* meet full Major Depressive Disorder criteria, but it is ""clinically significant"" - suicidal ideation, worthlessness, guilt, and irritability. Given the limited criteria, I'm going to assign the best code to fit the situation. The clear choice is **Other specified depressive disorder**; this is the best fit, and it's **F32.89**.
*   The vignette mentions Social Anxiety, even if it is linked to the staring behavior. The key is, are these fears *limited to* the staring, or is it broader? Based on the prompt phrasing of ""endorsed criteria,"" I'm thinking about the level of functional impairment and how this impacts quality of life. Even if the avoidance is tied to the OCD, there is significant avoidance. So, I will include this for diagnostic completeness. The relevant code is **Social anxiety disorder**; this one is **F40.10**.
*   Regarding the agoraphobia, the patient ""endorsed criteria... on screening."" This means the patient meets the clinical criteria, even if it is about the OCD. I need to note this, even if it is secondary. The code is **F40.00** for agoraphobia.
*   The patient reports ""panic attacks,"" which are specifically triggered. So, a diagnosis of panic disorder is unlikely. While it's tricky, the concern is about ""iffy mood"" and general anxiety. There are worries about unemployment and the ability to provide for children. The best code is **Generalized Anxiety Disorder**, and that one is **F41.1**. I have to pick an F-code for this list.

Those diagnoses should cover this patient's clinical situation as best as possible.

Okay, here's how I'd approach this case, keeping my DSM-5-TR knowledge sharp and the rubric in mind. First, I'm parsing the request. Expert psychiatrist, DSM-5-TR, structured output – top 5 diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes. No justifications allowed in the final output. Got it.

Now, into the clinical picture. Thirty-two-year-old male, presenting with bizarre behavior: threatening a neighbor with a knife, agitation, combative, the whole nine yards. Red flags all over. Persecutory delusions (the FBI, the government), disorganized behavior, poor insight and judgment. The substance use history is key: polysubstance use (cocaine, marijuana, methamphetamine), with recent methamphetamine use admitted. Refused the urine test, but the history is pretty clear. He's had one prior admission, also meth-related, and was on Seroquel (quetiapine) but non-adherent. No baseline psychosis mentioned. Importantly, the course is rapid. Cleared up quickly, even with the minimal treatment on the unit. This rapid resolution is very important.

Now, into the diagnostic reasoning. It's almost certain that the first diagnosis is **Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder (Methamphetamine)**. The patient admitted to it, and the timeline fits perfectly, so the code is F15.51. Gotta be specific: Amphetamine-type. The symptoms match. The quick resolution is critical. The history of a similar 3-day admission reinforces this link.

Second, given the recent use and pattern of it, it's gotta be **Stimulant Use Disorder (Methamphetamine)**. History of use, legal troubles, and continued use despite consequences. F15.20 is the code. Even though it's polysubstance, the meth is the driver here.

Third, I need to keep a differential open, just in case there's something underlying masked by the drugs. However, the rapid clearance will likely take care of this. However, since the psychosis cleared within 3 days, **Brief Psychotic Disorder** (F23) fits if the substance component is disproven. Though, if the substance component is removed, the Brief Psychotic Disorder is the equivalent. **Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder** (F29) is a good safety net. Given the brief duration and the likely substance cause, it's the safest until that is fully confirmed.

Fourth, again, that rapid clearing. A Brief Psychotic Disorder might fit if the meth played a minor role or triggered a quick vulnerability, though the substance exclusion criteria is usually in play here. But as a differential, it accounts for the timeline better than schizophrenia.

Fifth, a thought on **Antisocial Personality Disorder** (or traits). The violence, legal issues, substance abuse... but without conduct disorder before age 15, I'd have to go with Unspecified or Other Specified. However, focusing on the other substances: I'm seeing ""past medical history... cocaine, marijuana..."" and admitting to meth use. His ""polysubstance"" history strongly suggests comorbid use disorders, so I can include one here. I'll go with **Stimulant Use Disorder (Cocaine)**. The vignette lists cocaine first in the past medical history, so I can justify that choice, but marijuana is just as valid. I need to be methodical in this. I'll be sure to list the cocaine use disorder. However, I must keep a check in my mind of other medical mimics.

Let's re-evaluate medical mimics. The elevated WBC (18k) could be an infection or withdrawal or due to stress but, in this case, in the context of meth, this is most likely from the meth use and will resolve. However, the structured delusions make psychosis more likely than delirium.

So, I will select the following for the Top 5:

1. **Amphetamine-induced psychotic disorder** (The most salient clinical picture). F15.51.
2. **Amphetamine-type substance use disorder** (The underlying chronic condition). F15.20.
3. **Brief psychotic disorder** (F23) - if substance is ruled out, this is the most likely.
4. **Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder** (F29) - holding diagnosis.
5. **Cocaine use disorder**. (F14.20)

I will now verify that the DSM-5 codes align with ICD-10-CM codes. Then I will stick with the Amphetamine-induced code, because that's the driver. The patient denied the Seroquel. The key detail is the napping and rapid resolution in 3 days. The drowsiness is *the* crash of stimulant withdrawal. I

The patient also has demonstrated cannabis use and Xanax dependency.","**Diagnostic Reasoning Summary**

Okay, here's how I'm approaching this, step-by-step. First, I have to be clear on what's being asked of me: I'm acting as an expert psychiatrist, tasked with diagnosing a patient based on this vignette, using the DSM-5-TR. I'm aiming for a high level of performance here, which means I need to consider all the nuances and patterns. The output is a *strict list* of the top 5 diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes—no reasoning allowed in the final output. The patient is a 16-year-old male, and I'll lay out my thought process.

I'm starting by extracting the critical data and looking for patterns. Demographics – 16-year-old male. The timeline is important: ""Recently"" starting therapy, but the SI months ago, and new onset paranoia. Depressive symptoms are present: Low energy, withdrawal, mood constriction, poor concentration, rumination, thoughts of death, and sleep problems. Psychotic symptoms include paranoia (persecutory delusions, visual distortions ""faces morphing""). The patient has a substance use history, ""bars"" (benzodiazepines) long term and the marijuana. There's a trauma history: his biological father abusing his mother, and self-harm – cutting. The patient responded rapidly to the meds.

Now the diagnostic reasoning begins. The key is to differentiate the mood symptoms from the psychosis. Does this fit Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features, Schizoaffective Disorder, or Schizophrenia? The mood symptoms seem temporally primary and prominent. Is this Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features or Schizoaffective Disorder? Substance induction has to be ruled out first.

Considering substance use: He's positive for cannabis. He claims he uses it for paranoia, but it can induce psychosis. He has long-term use of benzodiazepines, but is evasive. Withdrawal can cause anxiety, seizures, and psychosis. So, is the psychosis induced or is it co-occurring? His rapid improvement in the hospital (presumably without substances) seems to point to substance-induced or a mood disorder. However, the mood issues (SI, cutting) *predated* the “new” paranoia. Because of that I will prioritize that. Given the ambiguity, I'll prioritize the mood disorder because it was earlier. MDD versus substance-induced? It's hard to distinguish in a 16-year-old. The depression seems chronic, given the past months of SI/cutting. The psychosis might be substance-induced, but I have to lean toward MDD with psychotic features.

Could it be a primary psychotic disorder? Could it be schizophrenia/schizophreniform? The patient is 16, so the age is right. There's withdrawal, decline in functioning, and irritability. However, the mood symptoms are very significant.

Refining the top 5:

1.  Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, severe with psychotic features (F32.3). The MDE criteria are clear. Psychosis is present. Substance use is there, but the depressive symptoms existed earlier. ""No known past psych history"" is in the vignette, and this implies Single Episode is technically correct, although the past SI implies chronicity.
2.  Cannabis-Induced Psychotic Disorder (F12.51) needs to be listed. The positive UDS, ""new onset paranoia"" with marijuana use, and visual distortions are important.
3.  Cannabis Use Disorder, Severe (F12.20). This is needed if the diagnosis is substance-induced.
4.  Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder (F13.20). The long-term use of ""bars"" is significant.
5.  Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (F43.10) is possible given the rumination on the mother's abuse, or Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1). Or it could be Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder (F29).

Re-evaluating based on ""Level 5"" nuance: The ""new onset"" paranoia and positive UDS is a classic presentation for Cannabis-Induced Psychosis. However, the depression seems independent and severe. I will select **MDD with psychotic features**. Substance use disorders *must* be coded. Nonsuicidal Self-Injury is a condition for further study but technically coded as **Personal history of self-harm** (R45.851 - non F-code) or usually subsumed under Borderline (no clear evidence yet) or MDD. The prompt asks for F-codes only.

What about the trauma? It sounds like ruminative depression rather than classic PTSD. The ""morphing faces"" is often seen in Cannabis or early prodromal psychosis.

1028,"A 14-year-old male patient with a history of generalized anxiety disorder is brought to his pediatrician for a skin exam after she saw the patient wiping his skin down with a Clorox wipe.

He states that he spends a lot of time washing his hands because if he misses a spot or brushes his hand against the side of the sink, he needs to start over to ensure that they are fully clean.

Okay, here's my considered assessment of this clinical vignette. As an expert, I've approached this systematically, just as I would in practice.

1.  **I have identified Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) as the primary diagnosis.** The patient presents with classic obsessions (contamination fear) and compulsions (washing, wiping, restarting rituals). The time-consuming nature and functional impairment (school struggle) seal the deal. I am using **F42** as the ICD-10 code here as this is what is listed in the DSM-5-TR.

2.  **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is also relevant.** A history of GAD is established. This is a very common comorbidity. While the vignette highlights the contamination fear, the GAD provides a useful historical context for understanding the full clinical picture. The code is **F41.1**.

3.  **I'm including Illness Anxiety Disorder as a differential.** While OCD explains the rituals, the patient's initial fear centered on catching COVID. The patient's behaviors could be viewed through the lens of illness anxiety, where he's intensely preoccupied with the possibility of acquiring a serious illness. The code is **F45.21**.

4.  **Specific Phobia (Other) is a key differential.** The fear of germs and contamination could be framed as a specific phobia of a situation or stimulus. However, the rituals are the key differentiator for OCD. Still, this is a strong consideration. The code is **F40.248**.

5.  **Agoraphobia is also a consideration.** The described fear of ""outside"" (contamination) could lead to agoraphobic avoidance. His room is his ""clean"" space. This could be interpreted as avoidance of environments that are perceived as dangerous. The code is **F40.00**.

**I'm presenting this as a differential list, as I think this best reflects the prompt's request for ""Diagnostic Reasoning and Differential Diagnosis"" and will result in the greatest demonstration of expertise.**

1029,"Patient is a 23-year-old male patient with a past psychiatric history of anxiety and depression who is hospitalized for a suicide attempt 2 days ago during a fight with his girlfriend. He reports that he took a handful of pills (escitalopram) that he has prescribed for anxiety. He reports that 2 days ago, his girlfriend was angry at him and suggested that she was thinking about leaving the relationship. The patient reports that he felt very hurt and wanted to show her how much he was hurt by her statement, which is why he took the pills. He described the act as impulsive and wasn’t sure if he truly wanted to die in the moment. He states that he does not regret his decision but also denies any suicidal ideation (SI) currently.

This suicide attempt is not secondary to major depressive disorder (MDD) as he does not have the criteria for MDD of >2 weeks of low/depressed mood or anhedonia.","**Diagnostic Thought Process Summary**

Alright, let's break this down. As an expert, I need to provide a top 5 list of diagnoses, but the process is key. First, I absorbed all the data: a 23-year-old male, recent suicide attempt, and a clear trigger – a fight with his girlfriend and her suggestion of a breakup. His self-harm history and patterns of interpersonal difficulties jump out. This is all screaming *Borderline Personality Disorder* (BPD) to me. I'm focusing on those fears of abandonment, the affective instability, impulsive behavior, and the chronic feelings of emptiness. The history of anxiety and depression needs attention too.

The mental steps are as follows:

1.  **Borderline Personality Disorder (F60.3):** This is the core pathology that explains the central presentation. The suicide attempt, abandonment issues, unstable relationships, and mood swings all align perfectly with BPD criteria. The suicidal gestures, cutting, mood reactivity, and intense anger are also tell-tale signs. It's the strongest fit, hands down.
2.  **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Recurrent (F33.41):** He has a history of depression, and despite his denial of current full depressive symptoms, the suicide attempt raises the flag. The vignette indicates that the symptoms developed in response to the stressor and within three months, though not meeting full criteria, and given the PPHx, this is still a reasonable, likely, and clinically useful diagnosis. I am using ""in partial remission"" given the denial of recent full-criteria depressive symptoms (denies neurovegetative symptoms, denies depressed mood prior to the fight). In a hospital setting, past suicide attempts often mean to evaluate for a mood disorder. ""Past psychiatric history of anxiety and depression"" supports this diagnosis.
3.  **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) (F41.1):** He's on escitalopram, and the history is there, so it makes sense to include this. Though no specific anxiety symptoms were detailed in the vignette.
4.  **Narcissistic Personality Disorder (F60.1):** It's not the primary, but those interpersonal dynamics are evident. The ""betrayal"" regarding the provider, the feeling of not being understood, and a sense of entitlement are important differential markers. The patient's behaviors, demands, and sense of ""specialness"" point to the narcissistic personality. This shows pattern recognition.
5.  **Adjustment Disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct (F43.25):** The immediate response to the fight – the suicidal behavior – is what makes this diagnosis important. While BPD explains the underlying vulnerability, this diagnoses the acute reaction. As an expert, I note that, clinically, if the BPD diagnosis is not fully established yet, this diagnosis is commonly used to capture the acute crisis and trigger. It's often included in the differential.

    I considered *Histrionic Personality Disorder* as the fifth because of the performative nature of the suicide attempt (""to show her how much he was hurt""), but the narcissistic traits were more prominent and distinct, so I included those as a more precise fit. ""Show her how much he was hurt"" has a manipulative/dramatic quality that can be attributed to either histrionic traits or BPD. If the goal is a list, the differential must be considered. In the ER, you'd list all five.

She reports that she feels her husband does not understand nor respect her because he was requesting to return home to be closer to his workplace.

However, when pointing out husband’s discomfort with the long commute time to work, she minimized his concern and did not acknowledge his struggle, instead redirecting the conversation to her own feelings.

That’s why they sent me here.” She also alludes to believing that her mother-in-law called the police to have her brought here to get her away from her husband because she’s “jealous I get to spend more time with her son than she does.” When informing her that the reason for her hospitalization was the threat of suicide, she casually waves it off, stating, “Oh, I don’t actually want to kill myself, I just said that to get my husband to listen to me.”",Narcissistic personality disorder (F60.81),,ashley_huang,Narcissistic personality disorder,Narcissistic personality disorder (F60.81),"Patient demonstrates an expectation to be recognized as superior (like with her mother-in-law), feeling that they are special and can only be understood by smart people like doctors, exploitative behaviors of expecting her husband to go along with her every demand and attempting to manipulate him via suicidal threats when he does not comply, a lack of empathy towards her husband, and believing that her mother-in-law is envious of her. These traits are key features for narcissistic personality disorder.","**My Diagnostic Process**

Okay, here's how I'm approaching this: I need to act as an expert psychiatrist, providing the top five *psychiatric* diagnoses (F-codes) for this patient, based on the provided vignette, using the DSM-5-TR. I have to deliver the final list; *no* explaining my reasoning, but I will perform the clinical reasoning at Level 5. I will make sure I do not output reasoning.

First, I'm carefully extracting key data from the vignette: age, presenting complaint (suicidal threats), history of present illness (recent marital argument), and interpersonal dynamics with her husband and mother-in-law. I'm noting specific behaviors like the instrumental suicide threat, the ""good man"" versus ""no"" idealization/devaluation, the lack of empathy regarding the husband's commute and work needs, and how she minimizes her own contribution. Also noting her grandiosity with regard to her husband's work and entitlement (the hotel stay). Finally, I will also take into consideration her over-familiarity and grandiosity with the physicians and that she denies any psychiatric history.

Next, I'm organizing this data. I'm looking for personality traits and how they fit diagnostic criteria. I can see maladaptive personality traits (not acute mood or psychotic symptoms) are the primary signal in this vignette. Based on the data, the main diagnostic contender is *Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD)*: I see grandiosity, a need for admiration (even if she isn't working), a lack of empathy, a sense of entitlement, arrogance, and interpersonal exploitation. This fits very well.

*   *Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)* is another contender: the suicide threat (even if instrumental), intense interpersonal conflicts, and a sort of splitting (""good man"" versus ""disrespectful""), all of these are BPD indicators.
*   *Histrionic Personality Disorder (HPD)* may apply: there is dramatic presentation, the instrumental suicide threat, but the core issue seems less about seeking attention and more about status and a sense of entitlement.
*   *Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD)* is possible based on lying and lack of empathy, but it is less likely without the childhood history of Conduct Disorder. The motivation for the manipulation seems to be ego-driven.
*   *Delusional Disorder* or *Brief Psychotic Disorder* seems unlikely. The ""jealous MIL"" comment is likely more projection of an overvalued idea and a part of the ""specialness"" of NPD.
*   *Adjustment Disorder* is a potential diagnosis: given the acute stressor (marital/MIL conflict) and the behavioral crisis (suicidal threat), I can use Adjustment Disorder if the presentation is acute and if the personality disorder doesn't explain the acute crisis, which it does in this case.
*   *Bipolar Disorder* seems much less likely: There are no mood symptoms.

I’m refining my list now. *NPD is the strongest signal*. With the instrumental suicide threat, BPD becomes the second most likely, since the presenting complaint is suicidality. HPD is third because of the dramatic nature of the suicide threat. Adjustment Disorder is a solid fourth because of the acute situational response (suicidality) and being an admission diagnosis. *Paranoid Personality Disorder* seems likely due to the ""persecution"" around the mother-in-law. The list will include the following five diagnoses:

1.  Narcissistic personality disorder (F60.81)
2.  Borderline personality disorder (F60.3)
3.  Histrionic personality disorder (F60.4)
4.  Adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct (F43.24)
5.  Paranoid personality disorder (F60.0)

I double-checked all the ICD-10-CM codes (which are US based) and they are correct. After some reconsideration, the list is:

Okay, here's how I'd approach this vignette, thinking like a seasoned psychiatrist adhering to DSM-5-TR principles and aiming for Level 5 performance:

First, I immediately analyze the situation. I'm acting as the expert, tasked with producing a ranked differential diagnosis, including the ICD-10 codes. The key information is the patient's age (6), the school referral, the relatively recent onset of symptoms (5 months since kindergarten), and the described behaviors – disruptive, hyperactive, and impulsive. I have to avoid adding reasoning, so the response is concise.

I'd quickly extract the core data: hyperactivity and impulsivity are the most salient features. The context, specifically the kindergarten start, suggests a potential link, but the behaviors appear to be pervasive (school *and* clinic). I’m going to consider any possible exclusions. The fact he has friends helps rule out autism spectrum disorder (ASD). No anger suggests ODD is unlikely, though a necessary differential. The age is perfect for an ADHD diagnosis, with increasing demands in school.

Now, my mind starts sifting through potential diagnoses. Top of the list is *ADHD*, specifically the *Combined Presentation* or the *Predominantly Hyperactive/Impulsive Presentation*. The vignette has classic ADHD symptoms. The ""disruptive"" behavior is almost certain to include aspects of inattention. The specific descriptors (""getting up,"" ""loud,"" ""interrupting,"" ""touching objects"") lean towards the hyperactive/impulsive presentation. But, since combined is the default, and inattention often accompanies this presentation, I'll go with the combined presentation as #2, unless it's obviously one-sided. I will prioritize the Hyperactive/Impulsive presentation as #1, and use F90.1, the ICD-10 code.

The *Unspecified Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder* becomes important. The vignette's timing is a technicality: the DSM requires symptoms for at least 6 months, and the vignette only says *started 5 months ago*. Until that timeline is verified (or assumed), *Unspecified* is clinically defensible.

Next, I need to consider *Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD)*. The disruptive behavior is a red flag. However, I’m seeing no overt anger or vindictiveness, and I can't ignore that the child likes to play, is social, and is restless. ODD remains a top differential for any disruptive behavior, and so I keep it on the list.

The fourth diagnosis is *Adjustment Disorder with Disturbance of Conduct*. The kindergarten start is an obvious stressor, and this fits the timeline if the behaviors are a maladaptive response to the school environment. However, the behaviors appear chronic (in the clinic), and the onset is not immediately obvious.

Finally, I think about *Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder*. This serves as a catch-all if the criteria for ADHD or ODD aren't fully met, and it captures the impulsive/disruptive element without committing to a full neurodevelopmental diagnosis yet. Although the ADHD profile is stronger, I’ll need a catch-all for a true ""differential"" diagnosis.

I would then refine this initial list, considering the duration versus the symptoms, the age, and the presence of social skills. I am thinking of comorbidities, but in the context, these are ""different diagnosis options.""

Next, I will then double-check the ICD-10-CM codes to ensure they accurately represent each potential diagnosis.

I then review the vignette one more time to make sure that I’ve missed nothing.

I will list the final diagnoses as:
1.  Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Predominantly Hyperactive/Impulsive Presentation - F90.1

1032,"Patient is a 10-year-old female who is brought into the walk-in area of a psychiatric hospital for hitting kids at school. The patient is a ward of the state, both of her parents were found to be unfit to care for the child. The guardian received a report from her teacher that the patient slapped a classmate during an argument. The patient is in the 5th grade. She has had many other reports this year for throwing tantrums and getting into fights. Guardian reports that patient has a history of being returned from various foster and adoptive families due to anger and aggression. She states that since the patient has been under her care, she has noticed the patient to be easily irritable with little to no accountability for her own actions, blaming the other kids for annoying her or saying that “I didn’t mean it.” Aggressive outbursts occur multiple times a week. When asked, the patient says that other kids annoy her but is unable to specify examples. She also says that staff and teachers annoy her too. However, she denies hitting them. The patient during the assessment repeated interrupts the guardian and the evaluator saying, “I didn’t do anything,” and begging to be taken home. As guardian shares reports made by the school, the patient interrupts and calls guardian a “liar” and is visibly upset. Patient begs the evaluator to let her go home and not recommend hospitalization. However, when evaluator informed patient that aggression is often a reason for admission, patient suddenly becomes very angry, picking up a tissues box and throwing it at the glass divider between her and the evaluator. When evaluator pointed out her behavior, patient immediately becomes tearful and apologetic, stating,” I didn’t do anything, I didn’t mean it, I didn’t even hit you.” Guardian states that behaviors like this is what she is referring to.

She is described as irritable even between outbursts and symptoms started before the age of 10. She has multiple episodes per week. Her outbursts are against both authority figures and peers which makes diagnosis DMDD rather than ODD.,"**Expert Diagnostic Formulation: A Step-by-Step Thought Process**

Alright, let's break this down. As an expert psychiatrist, I'm approaching this clinical vignette with a clear goal: diagnose this 10-year-old female patient based on DSM-5-TR criteria, structured around ACGME Milestones for Level 5 performance, which means a high level of data extraction and diagnostic reasoning. No fluff, just the facts.

First, I'm meticulously extracting data: the chief complaint of aggression (hitting kids at school), the social history of ward of the state and placement instability, school reports of tantrums and fights, and a detailed list of observed symptoms and behaviors. This includes the frequency and context of the aggression, her mood and affect (easily irritable, tearful), lack of accountability, and potential triggers. I'm noting the context of chronic placement instability and behaviors across settings. I am paying close attention to the mental status during the exam: interrupted, argumentative, aggressive, labile, and denial.

Next, I'm organizing this information into symptom clusters to guide my differential diagnosis. Cluster 1 is irritability and aggression, leading me to *Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD)*. She has chronic, severe irritability and frequent temper outbursts (verbal and physical) inconsistent with developmental level. The ""irritable in general"" baseline is the key. The criteria seem met: multiple outbursts per week, persistent irritability between outbursts, and symptoms in multiple settings. Age and duration requirements are also there. High likelihood.

Cluster 2 highlights defiance and vindictiveness: arguments, refusal to comply, blaming others. This leads me to consider *Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD)*. However, the DSM-5-TR hierarchy is critical here, and if DMDD is present, ODD is generally not diagnosed. However, is the aggression reactive or instrumental? The ""blaming others"" aspect and physical aggression toward others pushes me towards Conduct Disorder.

Cluster 3 focuses on the violation of rights: physical fights, hitting, throwing. *Conduct Disorder (CD)* is now a strong contender, particularly the childhood-onset type given her age. The lack of remorse is concerning.

Cluster 4 points to a trauma/attachment history: ward of the state, multiple foster returns. This raises the possibility of *Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD)*, *Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)*, or *Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder (DSED)*. RAD is unlikely given the externalizing behavior. The trauma history and irritability/aggression point toward ""Unspecified Trauma"" given the lack of specific intrusion/avoidance symptoms.

Cluster 5 focuses on neurodevelopmental issues: impulsivity, interrupting, emotional dysregulation. This brings *ADHD* into consideration. Interrupting often, impulsive aggression. High comorbidity.

Synthesizing this, I'm building a hierarchy. My top diagnoses are: 1) **Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (F34.81)**, capturing the irritability and outbursts. 2) **Conduct Disorder (F91.1)** (especially the physical aggression and lack of accountability). 3) **ADHD, Combined Presentation (F90.2)**, covering impulsivity and interrupting. 4) **Unspecified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder (F43.9)** reflecting the critical context of placement instability.

Now, for that fifth diagnosis: Given the format requirement for ""Primary and Secondary diagnoses,"" I must identify the best *comorbid* diagnosis. If DMDD is diagnosed, I cannot simultaneously list ODD or IED. However, if DMDD is the primary diagnosis, CD and ADHD can be comorbid. The prompt is asking for a formulation. I must avoid mutually exclusive diagnoses. Is the 5th diagnosis *Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9)*? The tearfulness and begging for discharge are consistent. Is it **Intermittent Explosive Disorder (F63.81)**? No, as the irritability between outbursts favors DMDD. Could it be **Unspecified Mood [Affective] Disorder (F39)**, a placeholder for possible pediatric bipolar if the irritability is over-diagnosed as DMDD? Or, is it better to frame this as an *Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9)* or *Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (F43.10)* which is more etiology-based. The history of neglect supports PTSD, but without full PTSD criteria, I choose Unspecified Anxiety Disorder.

After carefully reviewing the prompt and the symptom clusters, I've considered potential alternatives but found that *Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9)* is the most accurate as the 5th diagnosis. Even if manipulative, the ""begging to be taken home"" reflects anxiety.

Here's my final, clinically sound list:

1.  **Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder

1033,"The patient is a 12-year-old male who is brought to clinic by his mom due to multiple detentions for his behavior. Per the school report, patient does not follow instructions in class, becomes argumentative with teachers, and is disrespectful, often using profanities against his teachers and staff. Mom states that he has started doing the same at home as well, refusing to do his chores, arguing with her when she tells him to do his homework, and mocks her when she confronts him. She notes that in addition to refusal to do chores, he will intentionally create more chores to do, such as making messes and not cleaning them up. When asked directly about his behaviors, the patient looks at the evaluator and rolls his eyes. He tells the evaluator that it’s “none of your business” and kicks the desk. When asked if there is anything in his life causing stress that may be causing him to ask out, he states, “yea, my mom.” He denies any depression or suicidal ideation.",Oppositional defiant disorder (F91.3),,ashley_huang,Oppositional defiant disorder,Oppositional defiant disorder (F91.3),,"**My Diagnostic Reasoning Process**

Okay, here's how I'm approaching this clinical vignette. First, I need to methodically extract the relevant data: a 12-year-old male with behavioral issues – detentions, home conflict – and a cluster of specific symptoms. These symptoms include a pattern of not following instructions, arguing with authority figures, disrespectful language and mocking behavior, refusal to do tasks, spiteful actions (making messes), and a generally irritable demeanor, along with the reported impulsivity of kicking a desk. The patient denies depression and suicidal ideation, and the timeline, while not explicitly defined, hints at a chronic issue.

Next comes the diagnostic reasoning phase. I'm focusing on the criteria of various disorders. First up is **Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD)**. This feels like the strongest contender. The vignette perfectly aligns with the core features: an angry/irritable mood (eye-rolling, desk-kicking), argumentative and defiant behavior (arguing, refusal to comply), and vindictiveness (creating messes). The behaviors clearly cause significant impairment, leading to detentions and family conflict.

Then, there is **Conduct Disorder (CD)**. While some behaviors, like not following instructions and outbursts, are present, the vignette doesn't quite cross the threshold for CD. There's no mention of aggression toward people or animals, destruction of property beyond mess-making, deceitfulness, theft, or serious rule violations. However, it *is* the next logical step up in severity, so I need to keep this in mind.

**Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)** is another differential. ""Doesn't follow instructions"" could be inattention, but it's more likely defiance. Nevertheless, impulsivity (kicking the desk) and school failure make ADHD a strong differential.

The next consideration is **Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD)**. The irritability and defiance in the vignette are present, but the required frequent and intense temper outbursts are not explicitly described. Currently, ODD seems like the better fit, but DMDD is a potential differential.

Finally, there's **Adjustment Disorder with Disturbance of Conduct**. The mom mentioning that he ""started doing the same at home"" could point to a precipitating event. If there's a stressor linked to the onset of behaviors, this becomes a relevant consideration.

Therefore, the prioritization would be: 1. Oppositional Defiant Disorder, as the primary match; 2. ADHD, as a likely comorbidity; 3. Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, due to the irritability and potential outbursts; 4. Conduct Disorder, to rule out more severe behavior; and 5. Adjustment Disorder if a distinct stressor is identifiable.

I'm now going to refine the ICD-10 codes.

The specific ICD-10 codes will be: 1. F91.3 for ODD; 2. F90.2 for ADHD (combined) or F90.9 for unspecified ADHD (given limited criteria); 3. F34.81 for DMDD; 4. F91.9 for unspecified Conduct Disorder as secondary; and 5. F43.24 for Adjustment Disorder with disturbance of conduct.

Now I am re-evaluating, and given the data limitations, I will use F90.9 (ADHD, Unspecified). I'm confident about these codes.

1034,"The patient is a 15-year-old male who is brought to the clinic by his grandmother for being irritable and angry at home. She reports that for the past few months, he has been spending more time alone in his room, will lash out when asked to come spend time with family, and has been spending less time with his friends. His grades have dropped in school, and he says it’s because school is “stupid and pointless.” When asked why he thinks so, he says it’s because he’s not going to amount to anything anyways. He appears tired and said he has been spending more time napping because of boredom. His grandmother asks him about his games that he likes to play, but he says he’d rather just sleep, the games are boring. He tells the evaluator that he thinks it’s dumb that she even brought him here because it’s a waste of everyone’s time.

Alright, let's break this down. As an expert, I need to approach this methodically. The task is clear: diagnose this patient using the DSM-5-TR, stick to the provided information, and deliver a ranked list with ICD-10 codes. No embellishment, just the facts.

First, I am carefully extracting the data from the vignette. We've got a 15-year-old male, described by his grandmother, presenting with recent-onset irritability and anger – a key piece of information as this often substitutes for depressed mood in adolescents. The timeline, ""past few months,"" suggests a significant change. Symptom clusters are emerging: mood (irritable, angry), social/functional (withdrawal, academic decline), cognitive/self-esteem (nihilism, worthlessness), and vegetative (fatigue/hypersomnia, meaning spending an excess of time napping), all pointing towards possible depression. There's also anhedonia: loss of interest in activities he enjoyed. The grandmother's statement that this is a change from baseline is crucial.

Now, let's reason. The prominent clinical features point strongly to a Major Depressive Episode. Irritability fits the adolescent profile, and the anhedonia, hypersomnia, worthlessness, concentration issues, and social withdrawal round out the picture, meeting the majority of the SIGECAPS criteria for depression. Given the timeframe of a ""few months,"" MDD is a primary consideration, and the impairment in school and social life is a significant impairment.

But I'm not stopping there. I am thinking of possible differentials. Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder is considered, but the age of onset and timeframe makes it less likely, though it is often confused with MDD. Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) isn't the primary diagnosis because of the ""few months"" presentation. Adjustment Disorder is considered, but the severity of the symptoms is more significant than an isolated stressor. Substance-Induced Mood Disorder? Always on the differential with adolescents, though there's no evidence here. Bipolar Disorder is also considered as this could be the initial presentation, but the depressive symptoms are the most evident. Finally, an Unspecified Depressive Disorder is considered if the full criteria aren't met.

Based on this analysis, I am going to develop the top five diagnoses.

1.  **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).** The ""moderate"" specifier is chosen (F32.1) due to impairment in social and school functioning.
2.  **Adjustment Disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct (F43.25).** This accounts for the anger and behavioral component if an underlying stressor is considered.
3.  **Depressive disorder due to another medical condition (F06.32).** This is vital to consider based on the fatigue/hypersomnia.
4.  **Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) (F91.3).** This helps to explain the behavioral aspect of the irritability and anger. While unlikely given the change in baseline, it fits the description.
5.  **Unspecified depressive disorder (F32.9).** A safety net if duration or symptom count is in question, and there's no better diagnosis.

It's important to rule out the potential differentials, and the final list reflects this careful approach, considering diagnostic complexity. In this case, MDD is the most likely and appropriate diagnosis.

Okay, here's how I'd approach this. First, I’m analyzing the request – I'm acting as a psychiatrist, tasked with diagnosing a patient based on a clinical vignette using DSM-5-TR criteria, aiming for a Level 5 performance on ACGME milestones. The goal is a structured list of the top 5 diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes, no reasoning needed.  I'm focusing solely on psychiatric F-codes.

Now, let's dive into the case data. I’ve extracted these key findings from the vignette: a 20-year-old female presents with depression and passive suicidal ideation. A traumatic precipitating event – her mother's suicide two months prior – included finding the body (a ‘pool of blood’). She's experiencing classic depressive symptoms: depressed mood, tearfulness, appetite and weight loss, concentration difficulties, passive suicidal thoughts, and social withdrawal. These have been going on for two months. Trauma-related symptoms are evident: nightmares, intrusive thoughts (linked to finding the body), and survivor's guilt. Then there's the sleep disturbance and possible manic-like symptoms: sleeping only 2-3 hours per night for about a month with preserved energy. There's also increased risky behavior: long walks at night and increased promiscuity with strangers. Past history reveals sexual abuse at 18. No substance use or medical problems are indicated. She has supportive friends.

Here's how I’m thinking through the diagnosis. I’ve identified several symptom clusters: Major Depressive Episode features are present. Manic/Hypomanic features are: decreased need for sleep, hypersexuality, psychomotor agitation. Trauma features are clear as well.

Synthesizing this, I'm first considering Bipolar Spectrum vs. Unipolar Depression. The *decreased need for sleep* with *preserved energy* and *high-risk behavior* (promiscuity) lasting for a month strongly suggests a manic or hypomanic episode. Given the potential dangers of walking alone at night and meeting strangers for sex, and the marked change from baseline, Bipolar I is the leading contender, even though she is currently seeking help for depression. The depressive symptoms are present, but the current presentation includes distinct manic features. The most accurate diagnosis is Bipolar I, Current or Most Recent Episode Manic (or Mixed/Depressed with mixed features).

Now, the trauma. The mother's death is a horrific event, and the patient's nightmares and withdrawal meet criteria A for PTSD. Timeline is > 1 month. The severity warrants a PTSD diagnosis.

Grief is also a factor, but Prolonged Grief Disorder requires 12 months, which is not present yet. Simple bereavement is a Z-code, but this is an F-code only task. This patient's symptoms are beyond simple grief, given the suicidality and manic features. Adjustment Disorder could be considered, but the criteria for Bipolar I and PTSD are likely met, excluding this.

Next, I'm prioritizing diagnoses. Bipolar I is the priority due to the decreased need for sleep, energy, and high-risk behavior. PTSD is second because it explains the traumatic event and related symptoms. MDD comes in third, as the most likely alternative if the manic symptoms are not considered criteria Bipolar. Brief Psychotic Disorder is a distant fourth if hallucinations were present.

After reviewing the specific symptoms, I'm leaning toward the ICD-10 codes. Bipolar I Disorder, Current Episode Manic, Severe (F31.13) or Bipolar I Disorder, Current Episode Mixed (F31.6) are the likely choices, depending on how prominent the depressive features are. Given the subjective depressive symptoms and the manic symptoms occurring *currently*, I believe the episode is likely *Mixed*. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (F43.10) is a clear comorbidity. MDD (F33.2) is a consideration if the manic symptoms are downplayed. However, the presence of mania precludes simultaneous MDD diagnosis in this case. Also, Borderline Personality Disorder (F60.3) could be a secondary comorbidity given the history of abuse. Adjustment Disorder is a lower level if I rule out the others.

Since I am considering the highest level of differential reasoning, here is my final order and rationale: Bipolar I has the highest probability, so I will prioritize this first, with a differential/comorbid order for the next four.

I am re-evaluating, and based on the instruction to provide a ""structured list... consisting of the primary diagnosis and 4 secondary diagnoses,"" I will treat this as a list of *comorbidities* first, and *rule-out/alternatives* second.

Here are the final codes:

Okay, here's how I'm approaching this clinical vignette. First, I have to *precisely* define the task at hand. I'm acting as a psychiatrist, aiming for a Level 5 performance (high data extraction and diagnostic reasoning) based on the DSM-5-TR, and delivering a structured list of diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes—no extraneous text. 

I start by meticulously pulling out the relevant data: a 25-year-old female, involuntarily admitted, altered mental status.  I'm zeroing in on the *acute* presentation: bizarre movements, mutism, immobility, refusal of food. Crucially, *the catatonia's response to lorazepam is a key clue*. Then, I dive into her history.  She has a history of depression, and, I note that she started sertraline 3 months ago (compliant). The triggering event? Mother's death. I carefully consider her depressive symptoms (anorexia, anergia, etc.) which are more than likely residual but also important. However, the *recent* week paints a very different picture. Decreased sleep, increased energy, expansiveness, impulsivity (the Mercedes!), a feeling of being ""great""—all strongly suggest a manic episode. I’m thinking Bipolar I now.  Then comes the ""crash""—confusion, disorganized thought, altered mental status—all in the last two days.  I review the labs, the mildly elevated BUN, the anemia. UDS is negative, excluding substance use.

Now the reasoning begins.  I’m looking for symptom clusters.  First, the catatonia: stupor, mutism, bizarre movements, and the lorazepam response. This is a clear indicator that Catatonia Associated with Another Mental Disorder is needed. Second, I look at the manic episode: elevated/expansive mood, increased activity/energy, lasting at least a week, and I find it. The history helps establish these criteria: decreased sleep, agitation, impulsivity.  Now I confirm that this is a *full* manic episode. I have to see if it occurred independent of her medication, if she meets full criteria. Then I consider the history of a depressive episode following the mother’s death. This is consistent with a bipolar nature of the illness and I'm finding evidence for both phases, in this case.

Synthesizing, the primary diagnosis *has to be* Bipolar I Disorder. The patient is *currently* manic, and *very* severely so. The most recent episode has been manic. The rapid onset of confusion/catatonia suggests psychotic features, or at the very least, catatonia. The specifier *is* ""with catatonia"" and the severity is severe.  I code this as F31.2. But, I must also code F06.1 for Catatonia Associated with Another Mental Disorder, because, it's also a major aspect of the presentation.

I start building the rule-out list. Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features is unlikely given the mania. Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type is a possibility, but not the *primary* focus because the psychosis seems linked to the mood episodes.  I still have to consider Medication-Induced Bipolar (Sertraline).  I then consider Delirium (""altered mental status,"" confusion, dehydration). While I have to strongly consider this, the psychiatric history makes Bipolar more likely. I rule out Brief Psychotic Disorder and complicated bereavement, given the severity of the presentation.

After careful consideration, here’s my top list.
1.  Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features - F31.2
2.  Catatonia associated with another mental disorder - F06.1
3.  Delirium due to known physiological condition - F05
4.  Other psychoactive substance-induced mood disorder - F19.94
5.  Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type - F25.0

Then I perform one final check to make sure the presentation matches the code, and everything makes logical sense. Done.

Okay, here's how I'm approaching this case. First, I'm defining my role and the task: I'm acting as an expert psychiatrist, tasked with diagnosing this clinical vignette based on DSM-5-TR criteria, adhering to Level 5 standards for both data extraction and diagnostic reasoning. My goal is a structured list of the top five diagnoses, including ICD-10 F-codes, and I need to base this solely on the information provided, no extraneous details.

I'm starting by meticulously extracting and organizing the data. I've noted the patient is a 25-year-old male presenting with increased voices and paranoia. Key timeline details jump out: six months of baseline functioning, a depression diagnosis three months ago, and the recent onset of auditory hallucinations, including command hallucinations. The suicide attempt and subsequent presentation with paranoia and homicidal ideation are crucial. I'm also carefully noting the negative symptoms like isolation, poor hygiene, and withdrawal, along with the family history of schizophrenia in the maternal grandmother. Substance use is denied, which I'll keep in mind.

Now comes the crucial diagnostic reasoning phase. I'm looking for symptom clusters. Psychotic symptoms like hallucinations and delusions are clearly present. Negative symptoms (avolition, asociality) are also evident. The mood symptoms (sadness, insomnia, poor concentration) are present, but the key is that the patient reports feeling sadder *since* the paranoia began, which suggests the mood is secondary and concurrent, not necessarily the primary driver. The duration of the disturbance is critical. The timeline suggests a functional decline within the last six months, with active psychotic symptoms for a month.

My top consideration is distinguishing between Schizophreniform Disorder and Schizophrenia. I'm meticulously going through the DSM-5-TR criteria. I've confirmed that the patient meets criteria A for psychosis (delusions, hallucinations, disorganized behavior, negative symptoms). The key is the duration. ""Six months back he was helping..."" implies a decline *since* then. Since he *was* helping 6 months back, it implies the active phase has lasted less than 6 months. Therefore, while Schizophrenia is the inevitable long-term rule-out given family history and severity, Schizophreniform fits the current clinical snapshot more precisely if the 6-month threshold isn't definitively met.

Schizoaffective Disorder is another strong consideration. It requires a concurrent mood episode and psychotic symptoms for at least two weeks in the absence of a mood episode at some point. The patient does have a history of depression and now concurrent psychosis, but I don't have enough data to confirm the crucial aspect of psychosis occurring independently of mood. The vignette suggests the depression may be reactive to the psychosis.

Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features is also on the table. However, the severity of the negative symptoms and the bizarre nature of the delusions (e.g., vents, enemies) make this a less likely primary diagnosis, although I need to consider it carefully. I'm asking myself, does the psychosis only present during the mood episode, and vice versa. It's not completely clear yet.

Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder is ruled out given the patient's denial, although I’ll note that it would require toxicology and is an important differential. Brief Psychotic Disorder is ruled out because the symptoms last longer than a month.

After this review, I've refined my top five differentials:

1.  **Schizophreniform Disorder:** Duration is likely >1 month and potentially <6 months. Criteria A clearly met.
2.  **Schizoaffective Disorder, Depressive Type:** Given the mood and psychosis, this is a strong possibility, but I'm cautious.
3.  **Major Depressive Disorder, Single episode, severe with psychotic features:** I cannot rule this out entirely and need more data.
4.  **Schizophrenia:** I'll list this because the severity, family history, and potential for progression make it a key differential but the timeline is the primary constraint.
5.  **Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder:** This acts as a catch-all given the ambiguity of the timeline.

I'm meticulously checking the ICD-10 codes. Then I conduct a final logic check on the ""Schizophrenia"" vs ""Schizophreniform"" timeline, and reaffirm that if the decline started *after* the ""6 months back"" mark, then the duration is < 6 months, favoring **Schizophreniform** for the Level 5 accuracy. Also checking logic on whether the negative symptoms and bizarre delusions are more strongly indicative of a psychotic spectrum disorder than a primary mood disorder. Finally, I confirm that the final output includes *only* the diagnoses and codes.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I need to stay focused: expert psychiatrist, diagnose based on DSM-5-TR, and stick to the provided rubric and output constraints (no reasoning, just codes).

I'm starting with a 42-year-old female with auditory hallucinations and self-harm ideation – that's a red flag. I see that she's disoriented to time and place, scared, agitated, and has some autonomic hyperactivity (high BP and pulse). Her history is crucial: depression three years ago (well-controlled), recent alcohol relapse after 3 years of sobriety, and the fact that she had alcohol withdrawal seizures in the past. Her last drink was three days ago, and her mom confirms some recent stress.

Now, let's synthesize: confusion, hallucinations, paranoia, agitation, and that autonomic stuff (tachycardia, hypertension), all combined with recent heavy alcohol cessation... It screams *Delirium Tremens (Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium)*. The timing is textbook.

My top candidate is Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium. The seizure history puts her at high risk, the timeline fits (72 hours post-cessation), and the symptoms are classic. It checks all the DSM-5-TR boxes.

Okay, other possibilities: could it be *Alcohol-Induced Psychotic Disorder*? The hallucinations and paranoia fit, but the disorientation and acute onset point strongly to delirium. But it is always on the differential. And what about *Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Severe with Psychotic Features*? There's a history of depression and recent sadness, but the acute onset and autonomic instability are less in line with depression, and the timeline with drinking is more persuasive. Could be the underlying problem, though.

Then *Brief Psychotic Disorder* - it's acute and stress-related, but substance withdrawal usually trumps that. And *Schizoaffective Disorder/Schizophrenia* is less likely at this age, and the substance use is primary. Unspecified Delirium is there but doesn't explain the cause, but if this is multifactorial, it is valid. Then an underlying *Alcohol Use Disorder (Severe)*.

Okay, let's refine this to my top 5. The primary diagnosis *has to be* Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium – the risk of death, especially with a history of seizures, makes this a priority.

Now, the secondaries: an *underlying* Alcohol Use Disorder is there – she had withdrawal seizures before and has relapsed. This patient needs help, so this is high up the list. I also want to include that past history of depression, and the recent report from mom. This indicates *Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent*. I have to consider *Alcohol-induced Psychotic Disorder*, as that's a direct result of the alcohol. In addition, given this could be caused by *another* medical problem (like an electrolyte imbalance), *Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition* is always a good differential. Then maybe *Brief Psychotic Disorder* due to the recent severe stress.

Now for those ICD-10 codes. I need to be precise, and I'll keep the differential diagnosis ranking.

Here’s my final answer:
1.  Alcohol withdrawal delirium - F10.231

Alright, let's break this down. First, I need to understand the request. It's a diagnosis, using DSM-5-TR, with a specific output format: a ranked list with ICD-10 F-codes. It requires a Level 5 data extraction, organization, and differential diagnostic reasoning. The input is a case vignette of a 15-year-old.

Now, let's analyze the vignette itself. We have a 15-year-old boy presenting with increased anxiety, onsetting about 7 months ago, following his friend's mother's passing. The core symptoms scream Separation Anxiety: distress when separated from his mother, fear of harm befalling her, school refusal, nightmares about her leaving, and significant functional impairment (declining grades, social withdrawal, difficulty concentrating). He's also showing cognitive symptoms like racing thoughts and behavioral ones like clinginess. Importantly, there are no psychotic symptoms, no substance use, or any identified medical problems. The clear desire is to spend more time with his mother and continue living.

Next, we move to diagnostic reasoning. The anchor here is **Separation Anxiety Disorder**. He's 15, so the developmental inappropriateness is established. The duration meets the criteria (7 months vs. the 4-week minimum), and the symptoms are textbook: distress, worry about harm, refusal to separate, and separation-related nightmares. It’s a clean fit for the primary.

But we can't stop there. Now for the differential considerations.

*   **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)** is a strong contender. The ""racing thoughts"" and ""mind doesn't shut off"" indicate potential worry about other areas beyond just his mother's safety. GAD is highly comorbid.

*   **Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety** is relevant due to the clear stressor (the friend's mom's death). Technically, it is preempted by separation anxiety, but the prompt asks for a ""differential diagnosis,"" or potentially comorbidities.

*   **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) / Persistent Depressive Disorder** is a possible comorbidity or differential. We see ""friends drifting away,"" ""lonelier,"" academic decline, and possible sleep issues, all potentially depressive symptoms.

*   **Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)** warrants consideration because of the social withdrawal and school refusal. Is school refusal driven by social scrutiny, or is it purely separation anxiety? The vignette leans towards the latter.

*   **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)** – The friend's mother's death is a potential stressor. The nightmares and negative thoughts are suggestive. The event must have been *violent* or *accidental*. The vignette does not specify. This makes it a lower probability.

*   **Panic Disorder** is less likely but could be present. The ""racing thoughts"" and anxiety could be precursors. The vignette doesn't describe full attacks.

*   **Specific Phobia (Death/Illness)** - His fear is related to his mom's safety. However, because it impacts separation, Separation Anxiety is the specific label.

Now, let's refine this to the top 5 diagnoses.

1.  **Separation Anxiety Disorder (F93.0)** - A perfect fit based on the symptoms and timeline, and trigger is typical for the onset.
2.  **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1)** - Accounts for the ""racing thoughts"" and broader worry that seems beyond the separation itself.
3.  **Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety (F43.22)** - Captures the situational trigger clearly. It's a strong alternative if the anxiety is solely reactive, but the full criteria are met.
4.  **Major Depressive Disorder (F32.9)** - To address the sleep, concentration, social, and academic issues. A necessary rule-out.
5.  **Social Anxiety Disorder (F40.10)** - To account for the ""friends drifting away"" and school refusal.

Now I need to finalize the codes, checking for any discrepancies. Separation Anxiety in childhood is F93.0. In adults, it is often mapped to F40s, but DSM-5-TR usually points F93.0 for early onset. Adjustment Disorder: F43.22 (With anxiety). MDD: F32.9 is safe for unspecified severity. Social Anxiety: F40.10.

Does this patient have ""Illness Anxiety Disorder""? Nope. He fears for his *mother*, not himself. No, and no PTSD unless we know more about the death of the mother.

The final list is set.

Alright, let's break this down. Given the clinical vignette, my expert mind immediately hones in on the confirmed diagnosis of Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.

1.  **Psychotic disorder with delusions due to known physiological condition** (F06.2). Paranoia is the primary presentation. This is the cornerstone of the diagnostic formulation.

Previously, he was still working as a patent lawyer and running his own law firm. He states that since the diagnosis (which he received 1 month ago), his mood has been more depressed with anhedonia, hopelessness, helplessness, low energy, and low appetite which he attributes to the nausea caused by his chemotherapy. He feels constantly worried about his cancer and what will happen to him and his family. The patient is married to his wife for 30 years and has 2 children with 4 grandchildren. He is concerned about the finances, getting his estate planning in order, and worried about what will happen to his wife if he were to pass.

Alright, let's break this down. As an expert, I need to approach this methodically. The task is clear: diagnose this patient using DSM-5-TR, level 5 performance, and structured output only, which means no justifications in the final answer. Got it. I'm looking at Patient B, a 60-year-old male admitted to a medical hospital on day 7, complicated by DVT. His medical history includes HTN, HLD, T2DM, and, significantly, a *newly diagnosed* prostate cancer one month ago, now undergoing chemotherapy. He has a distant history of anxiety from law school, no prior depression, no psych meds, and hasn't seen a psychiatrist before.

The key here is *the timing*. The symptoms of dysphoria, constricted affect, depressed mood, anhedonia, hopelessness, low energy, low appetite (potentially chemo-related), and constant worry *all* started after the cancer diagnosis. That's a red flag. He was working as a patent lawyer until recently, and he has a supportive family, although he seems worried about them now.

Level 5 analysis demands data extraction and organization. The most obvious *precipitant* is the cancer diagnosis. His symptoms are a cluster of depressive *and* anxiety symptoms. Let's start with the most obvious: **Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood (F43.23)**. It's the best *initial* fit. The symptoms developed within 3 months, are a significant stressor, disproportionate distress, and significant impairment. The cancer diagnosis is the trigger, and the combination of low mood and worry makes this the correct *specifier*.

Now, the next possibility: **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Single Episode, Moderate (F32.1)**. He has depressed mood, anhedonia, hopelessness, fatigue, and appetite loss. The duration criteria are met. The key here is to assess the severity: is this just an understandable adjustment, or is there an underlying MDD? Since I can't ask questions, I need to judge the severity from the data provided. Without more information I think a *Moderate* specifier is appropriate. This is my strongest differential.

Third, we can't ignore the *medical* component: **Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (F06.32)**. The prostate cancer itself, along with the chemotherapy, can *directly* cause depressive symptoms or exacerbate existing issues. This becomes a strong contender because of his medical history.

Next, let's explore the anxiety aspects. He has a distant history of anxiety from law school and presents with constant worry. Given his history, **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) (F41.1)** is a consideration. However, the timeline of this current worry (only one month) leans towards an *exacerbation* rather than *chronic* GAD, so this is a differential only.

Finally, we need a catch-all for anything that doesn't fit perfectly. If the anxiety is prominent, but doesn't meet full GAD criteria, or if something else is at play, the diagnosis is **Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (F06.4)**. Cancer and chemo can cause both depression and anxiety.

I have refined the list. The first is definitely Adjustment Disorder. The second is Major Depressive Disorder, if I can't fully justify the symptomology as solely an adjustment reaction. The third is the *direct* medical effect of the cancer. The fourth is Generalized Anxiety, and the fifth is Anxiety due to the medical condition, which is a key differential. It's a ranked differential, not a problem list or comorbidity list.

So, let's nail down the final answer, ensuring the output format is followed:

1.  Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood - F43.23
2.  Major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate - F32.1
3.  Depressive disorder due to another medical condition - F06.32
4.  Generalized anxiety disorder - F41.1
5.  Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition - F06.4

Here's my assessment of the provided clinical information, distilled into the five most likely DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses, along with their corresponding ICD-10 codes, as I formulate a clinical impression:

1.  Schizophrenia - F20.9: Based on the 2-year history of decline, the presence of both positive (hallucinations, disorganized speech) and negative (flat affect, withdrawal) symptoms, the significant functional impairment (job loss, hygiene decline), the duration exceeding six months, and the positive family history of schizophrenia, this is the most probable diagnosis.
2.  Schizoaffective Disorder, Depressive Type - F25.1: Given that the patient's presentation includes an ""appearance of depression"" that is likely a manifestation of his negative symptoms, Schizoaffective Disorder with depressive features must be considered in the differential.
3.  Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Severe with Psychotic Features - F32.3: Given the prodrome of negative symptoms, with significant disorganization over the last 6 months, an alternative explanation is a major depressive episode with psychotic features, although this would be less likely given the history of disorganization and the duration.
4.  Cannabis-Induced Psychotic Disorder - F12.151: Given the positive urine drug screen for marijuana, the possibility that cannabis use is at least partially responsible for the psychotic symptoms must be evaluated.
5.  Cannabis Use Disorder, Mild - F12.10: Given that the patient's urine drug screen is positive for marijuana, the patient's use of cannabis must be assessed. The ""Mild"" code is used to account for the lack of detailed history, while at the same time indicating a clinically present diagnosis based on the test result.

Okay, let's break this down. First, I have to efficiently extract the critical data from this vignette. A 25-year-old female presents with a clear history of mood instability. The core of this hinges on recognizing the past hypomanic episode and its interplay with the current depressive state. I'm focusing on key elements: a 3-week major depressive episode, characterized by depressed mood, anhedonia, hopelessness, low energy, concentration difficulties, and worthlessness. This is a pretty textbook presentation. Then, the crucial piece: a five-day period of elevated mood, increased energy, decreased need for sleep (2-3 hours is quite telling!), increased productivity, described as ""extremely happy."" This, in conjunction with the ""hyper"" reaction to Zoloft, makes me immediately think ""bipolar spectrum.""

The differential is going to center around Bipolar II as the main diagnosis. The five-day duration of the ""up"" period, the change in functioning and the overall presentation point directly there.

The next diagnosis is going to be Bipolar I, always a possibility that needs to be ruled out by considering the severity of the hypomania.

Considering the history of past psychiatric history, let's include other specified bipolar and related disorder.

The next thing I must consider is Major Depressive Disorder, if I were to discredit the hypomanic episode.

Last, Cyclothymic disorder must be considered.

Therefore, the final assessment must be:

1.  **Bipolar II disorder** - F31.81
2.  **Bipolar I disorder, current episode depressed, moderate** - F31.32
3.  **Other specified bipolar and related disorder** - F31.89

Alright, let's break this down. First, I need to understand the playing field: I'm acting as an expert psychiatrist, and the goal is to diagnose this patient based on the provided vignette, using the DSM-5-TR, adhering to the Level 5 rubric. No clinical reasoning in the final output, just a structured list with ICD-10 codes.

Okay, deep breath, and let's get to the data extraction. This 29-year-old male, a military vet with a combat history in Afghanistan, is presenting with insomnia. The symptoms scream PTSD: recurring nightmares, avoidance of triggers like loud noises, hypervigilance, irritability, anger, negative self-beliefs (""horrible person""), and profound guilt and regret. These symptoms have been present for a year, which is crucial for PTSD diagnosis, as it must be greater than one month. There's clear functional impairment as well, with marital difficulties and sleep issues that needed medical attention. Furthermore, his substance use is a significant factor: one pack of cigarettes a day and, concerningly, six beers daily, which started *after* his return. He is on Zoloft and Trazodone.

Now, let's analyze this. PTSD is the obvious primary contender. He meets all the criteria: combat exposure (stressor), intrusion (nightmares), avoidance, negative alterations in cognition and mood, and arousal. The duration is appropriate, and there is functional impairment. The substance use is secondary.

Next up, alcohol use disorder is a big concern. Six beers daily is a lot. He's clearly using alcohol to cope with his symptoms and, given the consumption and reliance on it, there is a strong possibility of moderate to severe alcohol use disorder.

Then, there's major depressive disorder. Sleep disturbance, guilt, and irritability are present, but these overlap with PTSD symptoms. However, his feelings of worthlessness and guilt are strong enough to consider it a co-occurring diagnosis. This is something that often shows up alongside PTSD.

Tobacco use disorder is also present, given he is smoking a pack a day.

Insomnia is present. While often a symptom of PTSD, the fact that it was the presenting complaint is significant, and Trazodone was prescribed. If the sleep is better explained by PTSD, then we don't code separately, but it's clinically relevant here. I'll include it in the differential. Generalized anxiety disorder also seems possible.

Alright, time to refine the list, keeping in mind the hierarchy of diagnoses.

1.  Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: The clear driving force here.
2.  Alcohol Use Disorder, Moderate/Severe: The maladaptive coping.
3.  Tobacco Use Disorder: A standard diagnosis in this context.
4.  Major Depressive Disorder: High comorbidity, overlapping symptoms.
5.  Insomnia Disorder: Focus of clinical attention, warranting a separate code.

I'm considering alternatives. The initial thought was generalized anxiety disorder, but his worry is most directly linked to his trauma. Adjustement disorder is ruled out by the PTSD criteria.

And let's finalize those ICD-10 codes:
1.  PTSD, clearly F43.10
2.  Alcohol use disorder, Moderate/Severe, F10.20
3.  Tobacco Use Disorder, F17.200
4.  Major Depressive Disorder (Single episode, unspecified), F32.9
5.  Insomnia Disorder, F51.01

That feels right. Primary is PTSD. The others are co-occurring conditions. The sleep problems, the heavy drinking, and the guilt all warrant attention. The rubric is satisfied. Time to submit this.

He says people told him that he was “completely different” and people had a hard time understanding his speech, asking him to slow down. He says that lasted for a “couple weeks” and then it “went away”. He was still hearing voices at that time. His speech is tangential at times and he appears internally preoccupied. Hygiene is poor.","Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type (F25.0)",,juliana_zhang,"Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type","Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type (F25.0)",,"**Diagnostic Formulation and Differential Diagnosis**

Alright, let's break this down. A 25-year-old male presents with a year of auditory hallucinations that have escalated in intensity, coupled with significant negative symptoms like social withdrawal and poor hygiene. We also have a history of a manic episode, which, the patient reports, lasted only a ""couple of weeks"" within the past year. This history prompts us to consider the following possibilities, and I'll rank them accordingly:

1.  **Schizophrenia - F20.9:** Given the duration of psychotic symptoms (1 year) significantly outweighs the duration of the mood episode, this is the most likely diagnosis based on the DSM-5-TR criteria. The functional decline (job loss, moving home) and the presence of negative symptoms further support this. The manic episode, while present, was too short to shift the diagnosis to Schizoaffective under strict DSM-5-TR guidelines.

2.  **Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type - F25.0:** This is the most important differential diagnosis. If the history of the manic episode is underreported, or if periods of depression are present but denied, this becomes a very strong contender. The concurrent presentation of psychotic symptoms and mood episodes is the key.

3.  **Bipolar I Disorder, Current or Most Recent Episode Manic, with Psychotic Features - F31.2:** While the timeline suggests psychosis exists independent of the mood episode, Bipolar I with psychotic features remains a valid differential to consider. It should be considered if the history is slightly inaccurate and the psychosis closely tracked the manic episode.

4.  **Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder - F19.959:** We must always consider substance use. The hypertension in a 25-year-old raises a flag, even if there's no explicit history of substance use.

5.  **Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition - F06.2:** A medical rule-out is standard. While less likely given the presentation, we must eliminate this, particularly in a case with such a relatively recent onset.

Alright, let's break this down. As an expert, I need to methodically approach this clinical vignette. The task is clear: diagnose this patient using the DSM-5-TR, with only F-codes in the output, and I need to do so with Level 5 reasoning.

First, the *analysis*: a 30-year-old male with a history that includes hyperthyroidism and a prior unspecified ""psychosis,"" but no current medications. He has been seeing a therapist for depression in the past. We have a 2-week history of some concerning symptoms, which is important to the diagnostic criteria. Now I need to extract the data.

I'm seeing a classic presentation: decreased need for sleep where he feels amazing, behavioral changes, impulsivity (taking out savings), hypersexuality, and a mood that is irritable, loud, and demanding. His speech is rapid and pressured. He's also displaying grandiosity (""I am God,"" ""Messiah"") and responding to internal stimuli, with frank delusions of grandeur, and therefore psychosis. The substance use: denies alcohol/tobacco but endorses delta 8 vaping daily/frequently, starting 6 months ago. I also have to consider the medical history of hyperthyroidism.

Now, for *diagnostic reasoning*. This patient has a distinct period of elevated mood and increased energy. That's our starting point. The *manic symptoms* are all there: grandiosity, decreased need for sleep, pressured speech, increased activity or goal-directed behaviors (restaurant plan, contacting women), and high-risk activities (spending savings, sexual indiscretions). The severity is marked, with hospitalization, legal issues, and violence, and with psychotic features. This *confirms* mania.

My *differential diagnoses* are now essential:

1.  *Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar and Related Disorder:* He is using Delta 8 (psychoactive cannabinoid). The onset of vaping was 6 months ago, while the acute manic episode started 2 weeks ago. Cannabis can induce psychosis or mania. However, the 2-week duration and severity *suggest* an underlying Bipolar I Disorder, although the substance use is a complicating factor. DSM-5-TR requires us to rule this out first. Given his ""past psychiatric history of psychosis"" and prior ""depression,"" this history *strongly* leans toward Bipolar I, even though the substance use is involved.
2.  *Bipolar I Disorder, Current Episode Manic, With Psychotic Features:* This fits the manic criteria *perfectly*. The history of ""depression"" implies a recurrent course, and the severity is clear with psychotic features (""Messiah,"" talking to self). This is my most likely primary diagnosis.
3.  *Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type:* This requires an uninterrupted period of illness with a major mood episode concurrent with Schizophrenia Criterion A (hallucinations/delusions for 2+ weeks without a mood episode). Here, the psychosis seems *linked* to the mood elevation, not independent of it. It's a lower ranking differential.
4.  *Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (Thyroid):* History of hyperthyroidism. Thyroid storm/thyrotoxicosis can mimic mania. I have to consider this as a differential, as it might be an *exacerbating factor*. In this vignette, unless labs explicitly show a thyroid issue is the *sole* cause, the psychiatric manifestation is usually implied as the primary problem.
5.  *Cannabis Use Disorder:* He is buying and smoking delta 8 vapes.
6.  *Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder:* If the mania isn't fully met, or the timeline is unclear. This is a low likelihood here.

Refining my top 5, I'm now leaning toward the following:

1.  *Bipolar I Disorder, Current episode manic, severe with psychotic features.* (The most accurate fit).
2.  *Cannabis Use Disorder.* (He is using Delta 8).
3.  *Bipolar and Related Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition.* (Due to Hyperthyroidism).
4.  *Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar and Related Disorder.* (Due to Delta 8).
5.  *Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type.* (A differential).

Now, the ICD-10 codes. Bipolar I, manic, severe with psychotic features is F31.2. For cannabis, given social issues and hazaradous use, I will assume a use disorder, F12.20 as ""Cannabis Use Disorder"". The Bipolar due to a medical condition will likely be F06.33. For substance-induced, it is F12.24. Finally, Schizoaffective

1052,"A 15-year-old Hispanic female with a history of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), stable on a low dose selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) for over a year, presented to the outpatient clinic with new-onset symptoms over the past 3–4 weeks including insomnia, panic attacks, and difficulty concentrating.

She denied anhedonia, active or passive suicidal ideation, and maintained that she still enjoys going to school and spending time with friends and her younger sister.

Washing face with cold water helped. Reported worrying about similar thing might happen again. During the evaluation, the patient presented with a constricted affect and became tearful while recalling memories of her cat but appeared more cheerful when discussing positive aspects of her life. She reported ongoing support from her mother, stepfather, and friends.

Criteria A: time line -developed within 3 months of the stressor; Criteria B: Impairment in functioning; Criteria C: Doesn’t seem like merely an exacerbation of her previous GAD and the depression, panic attacks, and intrusive thoughts are new.","**Diagnostic Reasoning Summary**

Okay, here's the mental process I've gone through. First, I have to clarify the task: I'm acting as an expert psychiatrist, providing diagnoses based on the clinical information using DSM-5-TR criteria. My objective is a concise, structured output listing five diagnoses, a primary and four secondaries, all with corresponding ICD-10 F-codes. It's a level 5 ACGME psychiatry milestone, so I need to demonstrate strong data extraction and reasoning skills. I can only use the information given, no speculation.

Next, I zeroed in on the data. I'm dealing with a 15-year-old Hispanic female with a history of stable GAD, now presenting with insomnia, panic attacks, and concentration difficulties, with a recent stressor: the death of her cat. Symptoms include intrusive flashbacks, loss of appetite, sleep disturbances, a panic attack with physical symptoms, and worry about recurrence, leading to academic decline. No anhedonia or suicidal ideation is reported, and there’s an intact support system. Her MSE indicates constricted affect, tearfulness, but otherwise normal.

Now, the diagnostic reasoning. Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood seems the most parsimonious explanation. The symptoms arose within three months of the stressor, causing marked distress, and the symptoms fit, excluding MDD due to the lack of anhedonia, and other criteria. The ""mixed anxiety and depressed mood"" subtype fits best.

Panic Disorder is another contender, given the reported panic attacks and the worry about recurrence. I had to carefully consider this, since the vignette mentions singular ""incident"" (attack) 2 weeks ago, plus plural ""panic attacks"". However, fear of recurrence is key. I'll consider it secondary, especially if the attacks are persistent.

Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) felt relevant due to the ""intrusive flashbacks"" and panic attacks that might be physiological responses to cues. However, without a Criterion A trauma (usually involving human death/threat), it's less likely as a primary diagnosis. Acute Stress Disorder is also not a good fit. I needed to focus on whether the cat's death qualifies as Criterion A for PTSD. It does not. Other specified trauma fits.

MDD needs to be considered, given the crying, insomnia, appetite loss, and concentration issues. However, the explicit denial of anhedonia and reactive affect make this less likely and, thus, a secondary diagnosis to rule out. This can be listed.

Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is on the table, as she has a history. It's listed on her chart, so I need to include it. The symptoms may be a worsening or exacerbation, but the Adjustment Disorder explains the new onset better.

I also considered ""Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder"" – this covers PTSD-like symptoms from a non-Criterion A stressor. Then there’s Uncomplicated Bereavement, which is less likely as the functional impairment suggests a need for clinical attention.

I then went through several iterations to rank these, keeping in mind the need for F-codes only, and the instructions. I settled on:

1.  Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood (F43.23) is the best explanation for the onset of symptoms.
2.  Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1) is the relevant history.
3.  Panic Disorder (F41.0) because of the reported panic attacks.
4.  Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder (F43.8) – to capture the ""flashback"" like symptoms that are trauma related.
5.  Insomnia Disorder (F51.01). (Distinct clinical attention to sleep loss).

I then went through further review, and refined my list several times, including considerations about Panic Disorder criteria, and whether Adjustment should exclude. After careful review, I believe the above list is the best comprehensive set.

1053,"A 20-year-old African American male with no prior psychiatric history presented to the emergency department with a one-week history of abnormal behavior, depressed mood, and headaches. He had been functioning well and working full-time until the onset of symptoms. One month prior, he had tested positive for COVID-19. Initial symptoms included anxiety, insomnia, depressed mood, and headache, which rapidly progressed to auditory hallucinations, paranoia, and functional impairment, raising concerns for an acute psychiatric or neurological process. On the third day of psychiatric hospitalization, the patient became selectively mute, immobile, and refused oral intake. He developed a low-grade fever and intermittent twitching of the right arm.

Okay, here's how I'd approach this case, keeping the ACGME rubric and specific instructions in mind. First, I analyzed the request: Expert Psychiatrist, DSM-5-TR diagnosis based on a specific clinical vignette, and the requirement for *only* ICD-10 codes in the final output. The level of performance must be ACGME Psychiatry Milestones rubric (Level 5 performance in Data Extraction and Diagnostic Reasoning).

I began with thorough *Data Extraction & Organization*. This involved breaking down the vignette: a 20-year-old male with no prior psychiatric history, presenting acutely after COVID-19 infection. The *symptom clusters* are key: early mood symptoms (anxiety, insomnia, depression, headache), followed by psychotic features (hallucinations, paranoia), and catatonia (mutism, immobility, refusal to eat), along with neurological signs like fever, arm twitching (myoclonus?), and moderate encephalopathy on EEG. Treatment response (or lack thereof) – ineffectiveness of antipsychotics, partial response to benzodiazepines – is crucial. I noted the rapid progression and full recovery within about a month.

Next, came *Diagnostic Reasoning & Differential Diagnosis*, and that’s where things get interesting. The central *Syndrome* here is, without a doubt, Catatonia, but the question is *why*. The onset in the context of recent COVID-19 and the EEG findings strongly suggest an organic/medical etiology. So, I looked for the *Etiology*. Initial thoughts involved ruling out primary psychiatric disorders like Brief Psychotic Disorder or Schizophreniform. However, the organic markers (fever, headache, EEG encephalopathy) steer me toward a “mental disorder due to another medical condition.” Despite the negative autoimmune workup, the temporal relationship with COVID-19, and the EEG suggest a post-viral or inflammatory process—potentially, COVID-associated psychosis/catatonia. The benzo response is highly specific for catatonia, which gives this clinical presentation a high degree of confidence.

Therefore, the primary diagnosis is likely *Catatonic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition* (F06.1). The ""Medical Condition"" is probably the post-viral encephalopathy, despite the inconclusive autoimmune workup. Now, if we *strictly* adhere to the negative workup, we consider *Brief Psychotic Disorder* (F23) due to the short duration and full recovery. The presence of *encephalopathy on EEG* is a medical finding. Therefore, the primary diagnosis should reflect the medical etiology driving the psychiatric presentation. The most appropriate DSM-5-TR category is *Catatonic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition*.

To be thorough, I had to capture the associated features: the psychotic features (hallucinations and paranoia) – *Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition* (F06.2). The initial mood symptoms, *Mood Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition* (mixed features) (F06.34) or (depressive-like episode) (F06.32), is possible, although the psychotic aspect is more prominent. The EEG finding of “moderate encephalopathy” often equates to delirium clinically, therefore I'll include the diagnosis of *Delirium Due to Another Medical Condition* (F05) as one of the top choices. The EEG makes that decision easy.

After a thorough reevaluation, I kept the diagnoses that are highest in priority: I'm leaning heavily towards the organic etiology, given the EEG, fever, and COVID link. However, the vignette does not have a definitive post-mortem diagnosis. I'll maintain Brief Psychotic Disorder (F23) as the ""safety net"" diagnosis, just in case the medical theory fails. Also, ""Unspecified Mental Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (F06.9)"" is a relevant consideration. After further review, I settled on a solid list:

Catatonia symptoms: stupor, mannerism, and negativism. It's important to treat catatonia and hence the diagnosis of catatonia should be made along with depression.","**Diagnostic Process: A Psychiatrist's Perspective**

Alright, let's break this down. First, I need to understand the task: Diagnose this patient using the DSM-5-TR, with ICD-10 codes, focusing only on the provided information. No medical diagnoses here, just psychiatric. Data extraction is key, and I need to think like a level 5 expert for diagnostic reasoning.

Now, the case. A 16-year-old Asian male, outpatient to inpatient, deteriorating fast. Dizziness, low blood pressure, weight loss – that's worrisome. ""Overwhelmed"" and depressed mood from the patient, 6-8 months' history, and a sudden acute change on Day 2 with mutism, immobility, food refusal, not following instructions, and unusual mannerisms. Psych exam showed dysphoria, thought blocking (that's important), constricted affect, avoidance – classic signs. Passive suicidality, an active plan now too. School bullying and family noticing withdrawal, fatigue, loss of appetite, no prior psych history.

My immediate thought is: Catatonia. Those acute catatonic symptoms – mutism, stupor, negativism, mannerisms – are screaming it. The DSM-5-TR criteria for catatonia is easy to confirm. Catatonia needs an underlying condition. Malnutrition is there, but this is preceded by months of depression and feeling overwhelmed. So, the depression likely *drives* the physical state, although malnutrition would make it worse. Depression's been there for months, with the significant weight loss, fatigue, feeling of worthlessness, the suicidality, and the psychomotor change (thought blocking, catatonia). It fits Major Depressive Disorder, and it's *severe* because of the suicidality, the admission, and the weight loss. Catatonia makes it even more dangerous. But, wait, is there an underlying psychotic disorder? He is young, thought blocking and mannerisms. Schizophrenia might be the first break, the catatonia being the early indicator.

Primary diagnosis: Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, severe, with catatonia. We code the MDD and then explicitly add the Catatonia Associated with Another Mental Disorder code, F06.1. Even if the catatonia is considered the defining severe feature, F32.2 is the best initial code, but we must *also* include F06.1. But this is the top five, so we distinguish it. Now, is it schizophrenia? Age is right. The prodrome fits. Catatonia is often found early. But those mood symptoms have been primary for *months*. No overt delusions, no hallucinations reported, so MDD with Catatonia is the most likely diagnosis.

What do I include in the top five? First, **Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Severe**, F32.2. Explains everything. Second, **Catatonia Associated with Another Mental Disorder**, F06.1. It's the acute, dangerous symptom. Third, **Schizophreniform Disorder**, F20.81. Maybe it's a first psychotic break. *If* the ""depression"" was really negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Fourth, **Brief Psychotic Disorder**, F23. Acute onset of catatonia points to this. Fifth, **Social Anxiety Disorder**, F40.10, due to bullying history. The ""overwhelmed"" feeling and the avoidance fit.

I'm thinking about ""thought blocking"" and ""mannerisms."" Those suggest psychosis or catatonia. The most straightforward diagnosis connecting the 8 months of depression and the sudden catatonic breakdown is MDD with Catatonia. The second most likely, especially in this age group, is a first-break psychosis.

So, I'll go with this:

1.  **Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe** - F32.2. It all fits.
2.  **Catatonia associated with another mental disorder** - F06.1. *Required* code.
3.  **Schizophreniform disorder** - F20.81.
4.  **Brief Psychotic disorder** - F23
5.  **Social anxiety disorder (Social phobia)** - F40.10

I need to confirm if F32.3 (With Psychotic Features) is better for MDD, but the vignette doesn't report hallucinations/delusions. So, F32.2, plus F06.1. The Schizophrenia vs. Schizophreniform – active symptoms have been recent, so, Schizophreniform is safest, but with the 6-8 months of ""negative"" type symptoms I need to be careful.

Alright. Time for the final list.

Okay, here's how I'd approach this. First, I’m clearly focusing on a 29-year-old female, a known Bipolar I patient with a peripartum onset of symptoms. I'm operating as a seasoned psychiatrist, leveraging my expertise to diagnose this specific clinical vignette with precision, adhering to DSM-5-TR, and adhering to the prompt's requirement for a sophisticated, Level 5 analysis. No text explanation, just the list.

The information is clear: 10 days postpartum, relapsed after stopping medications, initial symptoms were auditory hallucinations, poor sleep, paranoia, and poor hygiene. MSE revealed flight of ideas, inappropriate laughter, delusions, and distractibility. This is a severe manic episode with psychotic features, peripartum onset.

My thought process hinges on the patient's existing Bipolar I diagnosis. The acute presentation screams *manic episode with psychotic features* within the peripartum period. The ""peripartum onset"" specifier, critical given the timing (within 4 weeks of delivery).

The differential diagnosis is where I will earn my keep. *Brief Psychotic Disorder* is a contender, but the full manic criteria strongly leans against it, especially with a Bipolar I history. *Schizoaffective Disorder* is considered due to the psychosis, but lacks the requisite period of psychosis without mood symptoms. *Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features* is possible because of the ‘distant’ presentation, but mania is more evident here. Substance/medication induced or medical conditions are unlikely, given the unremarkable labs.

Therefore, the primary diagnosis is clearly Bipolar I Disorder, current episode manic, severe, with psychotic features. The ICD-10 code is F31.2. The F53.1 is the Puerperal Psychosis, but the prompt asked for the top 5 diagnoses and I should include it. The others are my immediate differentials.

Interestingly, a child can-not be diagnosed with ODD and DMDD at the same time and hence its important to differentiate.","**Diagnostic Reasoning Summary**

Okay, here's the game plan: I need to generate a structured ICD-10 code list for this clinical vignette. My internal process kicks off with a detailed data extraction, pulling out key information like the patient's age (15), presenting complaint (assault), mental state (irritable, monosyllabic), and a comprehensive history. I'm focusing on ""chronic irritability,"" those ""frequent angry outbursts,"" and the academic struggles—it's all relevant. Importantly, I'm noting the absence of hallucinations, delusions, or substance use. The pet caretaking really stands out; it suggests empathy, and it's key data to distinguish a callous nature.

Next, it's diagnostic reasoning time. First up, Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) – that chronic irritability screams DMDD. Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) is next, but I'm remembering the DSM-5 hierarchy – it's likely subsumed under DMDD if the criteria are met, which seems probable here. Then Conduct Disorder (CD) gets a hard look because of the assault, even though the pet care feels counterintuitive. I'm really weighing if this is a primarily reactive aggression. I also check Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) because of the academic troubles and impulsivity. I have to consider Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), because irritability is often depression in adolescents, and social withdrawal and academic decline are clues. Then, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), due to social difficulties, monosyllabic speech, and rigid thinking is in the running. I'll even consider Social Anxiety Disorder.

My internal synthesis process involves a ranking: DMDD gets top billing due to the chronic mood dysregulation, then Conduct Disorder due to the assault, ADHD because of the academic and behavioral issues, MDD because the irritability is a strong clue, and finally, ASD. I then refined the list by removing ODD based on DSM-5 constraints, and selecting ""Top 5"" diagnoses. I then cross-reference ICD-10 codes, and go back and re-evaluate this list as a differential diagnosis. After weighing all factors, I settle on DMDD (F34.81) as the core, with Conduct Disorder (F91.1) (childhood onset), ADHD (F90.2), ASD (F84.0), and MDD (F32.9) filling out the most likely diagnoses.

1057,"A 77-year-old Caucasian female with a longstanding history of depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), chronic musculoskeletal pain and cannabis use disorder, presented to the outpatient clinic with visible facial scarring due to persistent skin picking. The patient was calm, cooperative and logical in thought process.

The patient described a similar episode approximately 45 years ago following the “institutionalization of my brother”, when she witnessed the “shocking” treatment of her brother after his first psychotic episode. She reported that she picks her skin and doesn’t like the feel of scabs afterwards. She reported an intense desire to picks on her scabs which often bleed and she reported a sense of gratification immediately but feeling guilt and shame a few minutes later. She had to visit a dermatologist because of recent wound infection due to picking of her lower lip skin. She shared that her lower lip was extremely tender at that time. She tried wearing gloves to stop her behavior but she continues to pick at scabs and healing skin, particularly on her face. She is currently on the maximum dose of an SSRI and receives care for chronic back pain.

Insight is preserved and the patient is not delusional or psychotic.","**My Diagnostic Process: A Clinician's Internal Monologue**

Okay, here's how I'm approaching this clinical vignette. First, I establish my role: expert psychiatrist. The task is clear: diagnose, using the DSM-5-TR, with ICD-10 F-codes. The rubric demands a high level of both data extraction and nuanced diagnostic reasoning. I'm focusing on providing the *top five* diagnoses, just a list with codes, no additional explanation.

My initial step is to extract all relevant data. I'm seeing a 77-year-old female with a history of depression, anxiety, OCD, chronic pain, and cannabis use. The immediate concern is the skin picking, starting six weeks ago after significant losses: pets and her brother. This history triggers a past episode, 45 years ago, related to her brother's institutionalization. She picks scabs, finds momentary gratification, but then experiences guilt and shame. There are medical complications, specifically infection. Self-help strategies, like gloves and hypnosis, have failed, and she's on a maximum SSRI. The information includes that she uses marijuana.

Next, I meticulously organize the data. The symptom profile shows recurrent skin picking on her face, lip. The behavior results in scarring and possible infection. She has an intense urge, followed by a cycle of gratification and then guilt. She's unable to stop despite physical damage and external interventions. Her history is key: established diagnoses of Depression, Anxiety, OCD, and Cannabis Use Disorder. The chronology establishes a recent onset, 6 weeks ago, linked to grief from loss. There's a historical trigger—her brother's institutionalization and mistreatment—suggesting a pattern of stress-related episodes. She also has chronic musculoskeletal pain. She uses cannabis, she claims, to cope, but is also given a history of Cannabis Use Disorder. The SSRI suggests resistance or a need for augmentation, and the failure of self-hypnosis is a key indicator of treatment resistance.

Now, the diagnostic reasoning begins. The *primary* consideration is Excoriation (Skin-Picking) Disorder. The DSM-5-TR criteria seem to fit: recurrent skin picking resulting in lesions? Yes. Attempts to stop? Yes. Distress/Impairment? Yes (infection, guilt, shame). The behavior doesn't appear substance- or medically induced. Yes, she uses cannabis, but the picking seems tied to a specific emotional trigger and a pattern of stress-related episodes, making this the primary consideration, not directly substance-induced. The key is distinguishing it from OCD. The vignette mentions a history of OCD, but the picking is driven by an urge and gratification, which points to Excoriation, not classic OCD obsessions/compulsions. The DSM-5-TR distinguishes these. Excoriation is the primary disorder.

My *secondary* consideration is Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The history indicates depression, and she has significant recent stressors. While the vignette highlights the skin picking, the grief context and “longstanding history” raise the suspicion of an active depressive episode or vulnerability. The gratification from picking could be a maladaptive coping mechanism. Given the described symptoms in the current episode, and the patient's long history, MDD is a strong secondary diagnosis.

*Tertiary* is Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). The history states anxiety and the fact that the news media worsens it. Picking can be exacerbated by anxiety. The chronicity and external stimuli support retaining this diagnosis.

*Quaternary* is Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The patient has a “longstanding history” of OCD. The picking is distinct, but the history of OCD likely remains active. The rubric forces prioritizing the current presentation, but this is a central piece of information.

*Quinary* is Cannabis Use Disorder. This is explicitly stated in the history; the patient acknowledges using marijuana to cope, and the vignette states ""cannabis use disorder"". It must be included.

I also considered alternative diagnoses, ruling out: Body Dysmorphic Disorder because there's no evidence of picking to fix a perceived defect; it's about scabs and irregularities. Stereotypic Movement Disorder doesn't fit the urge/gratification cycle. Substance-Induced Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder is less likely because of the specific triggers and past episode unrelated to current cannabis use levels.

Now, the ICD-10 F-codes: For Excoriation (Skin-Picking) Disorder, it's F42.4. For MDD, given the recurrent history and new stressors, it's either F33.1 or F33.9. Without full criteria for the current episode, I'll select F33.9 (Major depressive disorder, recurrent, unspecified) or F33.1 (Recurrent moderate). Since there's distress, F33.1 is reasonable.

1058,"A 20-year-old male college student was brought in by campus security after exhibiting increasingly bizarre behavior, including social withdrawal, not eating or sleeping, and abrupt mood shifts.

Reported that the patient had been absent from classes for four weeks before suddenly returning, appearing disheveled and noticeably different from baseline. During the interview, the patient displayed slow, delayed speech that unexpectedly escalated in volume before he abruptly left mid-conversation without explanation. He had difficulty maintaining focus and gave vague or tangential responses. Making statements such as “god made me a rabbit and you are my master” and “I have killed multiple planets in my backyard”.

Alright, let's break this down. My mind immediately starts sifting through the data like a seasoned clinician. This vignette presents a clear picture of a 20-year-old male with a constellation of symptoms. I need to synthesize this information and arrive at the most accurate and nuanced diagnoses possible.

First, the clinical presentation is striking. The bizarre behavior, social withdrawal, and disruptions in sleep and eating are major flags. The timeline is critical. Two to three months of symptoms puts Schizophreniform Disorder squarely in the crosshairs, and the family history of schizophrenia sharpens the focus. The negative symptoms and clear evidence of disorganized thought and behavior push me toward a psychotic spectrum diagnosis.

Then, there's the elevated Creatinine Kinase (CK). This is the key. Given the presentation, lack of recent medication, and the catatonic-like features (slow speech, agitation, refusal to eat/sleep), Catatonia Associated with Another Mental Disorder immediately leaps into consideration. It's a critical diagnosis because of its medical implications and need for urgent treatment. This elevated CK indicates rhabdomyolysis or other muscle breakdown.

Next, I address the substance history. The chronic marijuana use since age 14 is a significant factor. Even though the UDS is negative, the history is there, and I can't ignore it. While the negative UDS makes current intoxication unlikely, Cannabis Use Disorder, based on this history, warrants a diagnosis.

Now, I consider the ""abrupt mood shifts"" that are reported. This is where I have to sharpen my differential skills. While the primary presentation is psychotic, the mood component is important. Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type, becomes a strong differential, especially given the age of the patient. Also, Bipolar I must be considered as the patient is 20, and the abrupt agitation and ""mood shifts"" (potential mania) fit. While I will not make these diagnoses if they are not the *primary* etiology, I must note that they could co-occur.

The absence of other medical conditions and normal labs (besides CK) means the focus remains on psychiatric etiology, primarily. Rule out other potential medical causes and focus on the rhabdo from catatonia and not a primary medical condition.

So, here's my considered list, reflecting the most likely diagnoses based on the provided data and my expert judgment:

1.  Schizophreniform Disorder - F20.81
2.  Catatonia Associated with Another Mental Disorder - F06.1
3.  Cannabis Use Disorder - F12.20

1059,"A 16-year-old Hispanic female, immigrated to the United States two years ago from a conflict-affected region in South America, presented to the child psychiatry clinic for follow up evaluation and with recent complaints of frequent and severe verbal outbursts at school. The patient had a documented history of chronic sexual abuse and has also witnessed violence, both in her country of origin and during migration. She was accompanied by her biological mother. The patient presented for an initial evaluation six months ago and was lost to follow up since then. At that time, a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was made by the same outpatient mental health provider. The patient reported significant improvement in frequency and intensity of nightmares since started on medications six months ago. Re-established care because the school staff reported frequent episodes (occurring one-two times per week) in which the patient would become suddenly angry, shouting profanities and making personally hurtful comments toward teachers, administrators, and peers. These episodes were often precipitated by perceived criticism, sudden changes in expectations, or ambiguous social cues. Despite these outbursts, the patient was described as highly intelligent, academically capable, and frequently helpful to classmates. She was logical and articulate in conversations when calm but maintained a guarded and cautious interpersonal style. During clinical interview, the patient was initially reserved but opened up during the later parts of the interview. She endorsed persistent feelings of anger, mistrust, and fear, particularly in unfamiliar or male authority-driven environments. She denied hallucinations, current suicidal ideation, or substance use. Sleep disturbances, including frequent nightmares and early-morning awakenings, were reported. Cognitive assessment suggested average to above-average intellectual functioning, and no evidence of developmental delays or psychotic symptoms was noted or reported. Prior to migration, the patient had limited access to formal education, which appeared to contribute to a heightened sensitivity to perceived failure or criticism in the current school environment.",Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) (F63.81),,pooja_chaudhary,,,Major differential is PTSD.,"**Case Analysis - Expert Level DSM-5-TR Application**

Alright, let's break this down. As a seasoned psychiatrist, I'm going to leverage my expertise to provide a clinically sound and well-reasoned differential diagnosis, strictly adhering to the DSM-5-TR. I need to make sure I am following all the DSM-5-TR guidelines and considerations.

Here's how I see this case unfolding:

1.  **Post-traumatic stress disorder (F43.10):** This is the bedrock diagnosis, and it's crystal clear. The chronic sexual abuse, witnessing violence, and the trauma of migration all serve as Criterion A. The nightmares (intrusion), the guardedness and mistrust (negative alterations in cognition and mood), the angry outbursts (alterations in arousal and reactivity), and the avoidance of specific environments are all symptoms that fit the core PTSD criteria. The fact that the patient was *previously* diagnosed with PTSD and still presents with significant symptoms confirms this. It's the primary driver, without a doubt.

2.  **Intermittent explosive disorder (F63.81):** Okay, here's where we get nuanced. The vignette highlights those ""verbal outbursts"" occurring ""1-2 times per week"" that are severe enough to warrant complaints. DSM-5-TR explicitly allows for a diagnosis of IED *in addition* to PTSD if the impulsive aggression is a clinical focus and exceeds the ""typical"" irritability seen in PTSD. The ""sudden"" nature of these outbursts, the disproportionate reactions to perceived criticism, and the fact that they're leading to school complaints make this diagnosis clinically important. It may be *better explained by PTSD*, but IED is often included in the differential when the specific *outburst* pattern becomes a primary clinical focus, so that's the rationale.

3.  **Social anxiety disorder (social phobia) (F40.10):** This one is very relevant. The patient's ""heightened sensitivity to perceived failure or criticism"" and the fear in ""unfamiliar or male authority-driven environments"" are a textbook presentation of social phobia. The ""ambiguous social cues"" also play into this. This diagnosis captures the *triggers* for some of the outbursts: the fear of negative evaluation and scrutiny.

4.  **Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified (F32.9):** In adolescents, depression often manifests as irritability and anger. While there is no explicit anhedonia or sadness described, the sleep disturbance, the persistent anger, the guardedness, and the history of trauma make a depressive diagnosis a very reasonable differential. It's important to rule it out, and the ""unspecified"" diagnosis is clinically useful here as the primary depressive criteria aren't fully enumerated.

5.  **Oppositional defiant disorder (F91.3):** Finally, we get to the interpersonal component. ODD is very common in this demographic. The anger, the argumentative behavior, the defiance toward authority (""shouting profanities,"" teachers) fits well. While ODD symptoms might be *subsumed* by PTSD or IED, it's clinically useful to consider this. The fact that this 16-year-old is ""helpful to classmates"" doesn't *rule out* ODD entirely but makes other behavioral disturbances more likely.

**In summary, here is the list, ready for clinical documentation:**

1.  Post-traumatic stress disorder - F43.10
2.  Intermittent explosive disorder - F63.81
3.  Social anxiety disorder (social phobia) - F40.10

1060,"An 18-year-old African American female was referred by her primary care provider (PCP) for evaluation of passive thoughts of death.

Socially, she has few supports and describes conflict with peers due to ongoing irritability.",Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) (F50.82),,pooja_chaudhary,,,,"**Expert Psychiatric Formulation: The Patient's Story**

Alright, let's break this down. As a seasoned clinician, I see an 18-year-old African American female with a complex presentation. My immediate priority is to understand the core of her distress and provide an accurate and useful diagnostic formulation.

First, I've meticulously extracted key data: her young age, gender, and the significant chief complaint: passive thoughts of death. The history reveals a cascade of interconnected symptoms: the alarming somatic complaints (dizziness, weight loss, nausea, dysphagia with negative workups) trigger alarms. There is evidence of significant weight loss and physiological compromise that *must* be immediately addressed. Mood symptoms (low mood, irritability, insomnia, tearfulness), anhedonia, and the chronic poor appetite with a *specific fear of choking* paints a picture. Important psychosocial stressors include dissatisfaction with college, disconnect from peers, relationship conflict, recent breakup, and a complex grief history (maternal grandmother's death, paternal death witnessed). Passive thoughts of death are a clear risk.

Given the clinical presentation, I believe the core problem is **Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID)** (F50.82). The fear of choking, negative GI workup, pronounced weight loss, nutritional deficiency, and subsequent physiological consequences (bradycardia, irregular menses) are strongly suggestive. This captures the eating issue and its medical urgency. The ""fear of choking"" is the driver.

Beyond the ARFID, there is also evidence of **Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Moderate** (F32.1). The low mood, tearfulness, insomnia, irritability, anhedonia, and thoughts of death are classic symptoms. The weight loss is likely ARFID-driven, but the mood disturbance is clinically distinct and significant.

I am also seeing a pattern of distress related to physical symptoms. The dizziness, nausea, and dysphagia, despite negative medical workups, point to **Somatic Symptom Disorder** (F45.1). The preoccupation with these symptoms is significant.

The patient’s history reveals a complex trauma and grief history. While she denies clear current PTSD symptoms, the past trauma (witnessing her father’s death) and the recent loss of her primary caregiver (maternal grandmother), coupled with current irritability and sleep issues, make me consider **Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder** (F43.8). This code is appropriate as a way to account for the grief/trauma background while the diagnostic picture is refined. Prolonged Grief Disorder is a likely diagnosis.

Finally, the patient’s clinical presentation suggests a persistent level of anxiety. I am also seeing a more generalized form of anxiety in this clinical formulation. The “irritability” and “insomnia” are key symptoms that are also common to GAD. The irritability, insomnia, and the “fear of choking” can also be explained through **Generalized Anxiety Disorder** (F41.1), as the symptoms are not fully explained by depression and eating issues.

Therefore, the final diagnostic formulation is:
1.  Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder - F50.82
2.  Major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate - F32.1
3.  Generalized anxiety disorder - F41.1
