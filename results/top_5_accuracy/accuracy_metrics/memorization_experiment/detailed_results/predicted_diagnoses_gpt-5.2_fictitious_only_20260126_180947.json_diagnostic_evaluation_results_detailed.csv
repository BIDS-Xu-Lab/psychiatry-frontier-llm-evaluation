1001,"Leroy is a 34 year old male, whose chief complaint is, “I am having intrusive thoughts.” Leroy reports that “since childhood, I have been experiencing intrusive thoughts.” He reports he has met with a number of psychiatrists in the past, and has tried a range of different psychiatric medications. Leroy reports he was recently recommended by his present physician to see a psychiatrist again, given how distressing his intrusive thoughts have become. His previous psychiatrist started him on Zoloft, and gave him recommendation for community based mental health psychotherapist.  Leroy has been taking the Zoloft (200 mg daily) for about 5 years, for what he states his provider thought was “anxiety or depression.” Leroy acknowledges history of periods of “sadness”, stating “yeah sad, sometimes, but not depressed; when things get out of control; its been a while though; when something feels out of reach.” Denied present or past suicidal ideation, and denied problems with active thoughts, plans or intents of harm to self or others. Leroy insists no problems with perceptual distortion or paranoia, and denied thought insertion or thought broadcasting.  Leroy stated that the intrusive thoughts, “first started happening when I was a kid, I was able to cope with them; getting better understanding what they were; ways to get them to go away; calm myself down and regain control and go on with my life; now that is not working.” Leroy states the most recent intrusive thought has been a fear that the chart bus he drives from his local airport to downtown stop will “slide off the road because of ice or snow.” He thinks about this, on average, about 30 to 45 minutes a day.  Leroy endorsed episodes of “panic” and “my body almost feels like its paralyzed; I experience pain from my spine up”, which lasts for a couple of days at a time. With regards to “generalized anxiety”, patient reports “I would have these thoughts about my ailing mother; she has schizophrenia; my body would react to whatever I was thinking about her; my body tenses up when that happens.” Leroy denied any preoccupations about his physical health, nor inability to leave the home because of anxiety. He reports to work regularly, and rarely misses any work unless he is very sick. He says he is never late to work or planned appointments. Leroy has a girlfriend, and says that relationship is going “great.” In his spare time, he continues to join his friends for basketball pickup games and video game nights, which he still enjoys. Leroy does remember a feeling of having to tap the door handle a few times before he opens it, but said this never lasted more than a few second and was not associated with any fear of catastrophic consequences if he did not complete the task.  Leroy acknowledges observed violence/abuse of his parents when growing up, and with harsh parenting to his 3 siblings, patient denied problems with flashbacks, nightmares or hypervigilance associated with the trauma. Patient works second shift, gets home around 1:30 a.m., reports falling asleep at 2:30 a.m. and wakes up at 10/11 a.m., and can typically sleep through the night without interruption. He reports his energy level is “normal through the week.” Denied recent or past mania. Reports contributing stressors are “work --- not the most peaceful environment.” Also reports mother suffers from “type of schizophrenia and for a while she was taking medication and just recently now decided to stop; that’s been going on for quite some time.” Leroy’s urine toxicology returned with marijuana, and TSH level was within normal limits.",Obsessive compulsive disorder (F42.8),,judah_weathers,,,,"**Evaluating anxiety disorders**

I’m considering the user's symptoms and what they might indicate. “Generalized anxiety disorder” doesn’t seem strongly fitting since he doesn’t report excessive worry consistently, though he does have tension. I’m also weighing other possibilities like “Obsessive-compulsive disorder,” “Panic disorder,” and “Post-traumatic stress disorder.” 

He’s showing some elements of OCD with intrusive thoughts, particularly distress over fears from childhood, which, while not severe, still affect him. I’ll assess if his symptoms lean more toward OCD as primary, perhaps with some generalized anxiety.

**Assessing potential diagnoses**

I’m considering that he might have some comorbidity going on. His worries could stem from intrusive thoughts, indicating anxiety due to OCD. There’s also a possibility of panic disorder or an unspecified anxiety disorder. 

I’m thinking about major depressive disorder, but he denies feeling depressed. Adjustment disorder could fit, but it’s not current. Trauma-related disorder seems unlikely since he denies symptoms. He seems to meet the criteria for OCD, with a chance of having ""Other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder."" I’ll focus on identifying the top five conditions that are supported by the available information.

**Considering diagnostic criteria**

I need to be cautious here; without significant impairment or time consumption, he might not fully meet the criteria for OCD. However, he mentions that his intrusive thoughts are distressing, which could still qualify him for a diagnosis. 

I should also ensure to provide the correct ICD-10 F codes for any diagnoses like OCD (F42), generalized anxiety disorder (F41.1), and panic disorder (F41.0). For cannabis use disorder, I might consider F12.90 for unspecified cannabis use, but I need to be careful because DSM-5 requires a problematic pattern that hasn’t been clearly established here. I might opt not to include substance use in the final diagnosis.

**Identifying potential diagnoses**

I need to settle on five possible diagnoses, and I think I can include ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" or ""Unspecified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder"" if there's uncertainty. I’m leaning towards OCD, considering he had door handle tapping, but it might be more of a habit than a compulsion. He does have obsessions and attempts to calm himself, which fits.

He denies psychosis and mania, and his mother's schizophrenia triggers worry for him. Additionally, he experiences episodes of body paralysis and spine pain, which could suggest anxiety-related somatic symptoms. I might consider ""Somatic symptom disorder"" or ""Conversion disorder,"" but since he feels like he’s paralyzed rather than unable to move, it might not be enough to qualify for that diagnosis. Muscle tension could be a factor here too.

**Exploring potential diagnoses**

I need to narrow down the top five diagnoses. He might be experiencing panic-like episodes but doesn’t fully meet the criteria for panic disorder. He seems to have anxiety possibly linked to his job as a bus driver, as well. While he mentions intrusive thoughts, the specifics don’t clearly align with generalized anxiety disorder since his concerns are specific, like worrying about sliding in snow. 

I think ""OCD"" could be a primary diagnosis due to his obsessional thoughts, and he also shows signs of generalized anxiety and other specific anxiety disorders. I’ll include ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" as well, but I need to be cautious about including depression without sufficient evidence. I'll use appropriate ICD-10 codes, such as F42 for OCD and F41.9 for unspecified anxiety disorder. I need to keep it concise and focused!

**Determining diagnoses**

I want to identify potential diagnoses carefully. He mentions some control over his issues, but I’m considering ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder"" (GAD) as a possibility alongside mild OCD. His reports of panic episodes might indicate something more complicated, but they don’t align perfectly with typical panic. So I'm evaluating options like ""Somatic Symptom Disorder"" or ""Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder,"" but he denies health worries.

It seems ""Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder"" (OCD) could be a primary diagnosis due to his intrusive thoughts. I’ll list the top five likely diagnoses, including specific codes, while ensuring they align with the information provided. Diagnoses like ""Cannabis Use Disorder"" seem uncertain, so I’ll approach that one cautiously. Overall, I’ll aim to present a clear, structured answer that reflects what I’ve assessed!

**Listing potential diagnoses**

I'm analyzing the criteria for various conditions while considering how they might fit together. First off, I see he has distress but it's not necessarily severe. His intrusive thoughts seem tied to OCD rather than substance use, and GAD gets complicated here since he exhibits a range of worries. 

I’ll list ""Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder"" as primary because he experiences those intrusive thoughts. For secondary conditions, I’m looking at ""Other Specified Anxiety Disorder"" and ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder."" Ultimately, my top five likely diagnoses will reflect this evaluation, keeping in mind the need for ICD-10 codes. 

I’ll finalize the list as:  
1. Obsessive-compulsive disorder - F42  
2. Other specified anxiety disorder - F41.8  
3. Generalized anxiety disorder - F41.1  
4. Panic disorder - F41.0  
5. Other specified depressive disorder - F32.8

**Determining top diagnoses**

I’m going through the information to pinpoint the top diagnoses here. It seems the primary issue is his intrusive thoughts, present since childhood, which strongly suggests OCD. While he shows some anxiety related to real-life situations, I’m also considering GAD, given his chronic worries.

There’s a possibility for secondary diagnoses like ""Other Specified Anxiety Disorder"" and perhaps even ""Other Specified Depressive Disorder."" I’ll finalize my top five as follows:

1. Obsessive-compulsive disorder - F42  
2. Generalized anxiety disorder - F41.1  
3. Other specified anxiety disorder - F41.8  
4. Other specified depressive disorder - F32.8  
5. Panic disorder - F41.0

**Considering potential diagnoses**

I'm analyzing the user's symptoms to determine the most appropriate diagnoses. It looks like ""Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder"" should be the primary diagnosis, given the intrusive thoughts that have persisted since childhood. For secondary diagnoses, I'm pondering options like ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder"" and ""Panic Disorder,"" but I wonder if they’re redundant. 

I need to focus on specificity; perhaps “Unspecified Anxiety Disorder” fits better overall. I want to ensure we have the correct ICD-10 codes for the top five possible conditions as we finalize the list.

**Formulating the diagnosis list**

I’m considering various diagnostic codes for this case. It looks like OCD with predominantly obsessional thoughts is a strong candidate, so I'll consider using F42.0. 

For secondary diagnoses, I have to pick carefully, balancing options like Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, and Other Specified Depressive Disorder. I wonder if I should include ""Cannabis Use Disorder"" since there's some indication of use, although it seems uncertain. Ultimately, I need to finalize a list of five that reflects the most likely conditions while following the DSM-5-TR guidelines accurately.

**Choosing the right diagnoses**

I’m mulling over which diagnoses to include. ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder"" could fit, but it may be redundant with other choices like ""Unspecified anxiety disorder."" I think using ""Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder"" as a primary diagnosis makes sense, especially since he has ongoing intrusive thoughts. 

For the secondary diagnoses, I might select ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder,"" ""Panic Disorder,"" ""Unspecified Depressive Disorder,"" and possibly ""Cannabis Use Disorder."" It feels important to order them based on the likelihood of occurrence while considering his symptoms carefully.

**Determining diagnoses**

I’m thinking through what diagnoses might apply here. It seems ""Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder"" could be primary along with ""Unspecified Anxiety Disorder,"" ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder,"" ""Other Specified Anxiety Disorder,"" and ""Other Specified Depressive Disorder."" I'm weighing the relevance of panic episodes and how to classify them accurately. While I consider using ""Specific Phobia,"" it might overlap with other diagnoses. I need to finalize a precise list that fits the symptoms while adhering to the diagnostic criteria.

**Compiling diagnoses list**

I’m considering which diagnoses to include. My proposed final list consists of ""Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder"" (F42), ""Other Specified Anxiety Disorder"" (F41.8), ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder"" (F41.1), ""Panic Disorder"" (F41.0), and ""Other Specified Depressive Disorder"" (F32.8). While ensuring compliance with the DSM-5-TR and considering the patient's symptoms, I have to balance the likelihood of each diagnosis. ""Panic Disorder"" may not fully apply, but I’m still capturing all the concerned symptoms adequately.

**Listing psychiatric diagnoses**

I've identified five potential psychiatric diagnoses based on the information provided. They are:

1. Obsessive-compulsive disorder - F42 (or F42.0)
2. Other specified anxiety disorder - F41.8
3. Generalized anxiety disorder - F41.1
4. Panic disorder - F41.0
5. Other specified depressive disorder - F32.8

While I've considered various possibilities, the focus here is simply on the structured list as requested. Each diagnosis has corresponding F-codes as required.

**Determining psychiatric diagnoses**

I’m working on distinguishing between various psychiatric disorders for the user. Based on my analysis, I’m considering:

1. Obsessive-compulsive disorder - F42 (or F42.0)
2. Generalized anxiety disorder - F41.1
3. Panic disorder - F41.0
4. Other specified depressive disorder - F32.8
5. Specific phobia (situational type) - F40.298

I’m weighing the likelihood of including specific phobia due to the user’s anticipatory anxiety while driving. This list should provide a comprehensive view without delving into reasoning, just the structured diagnoses and their respective codes.

**Formulating diagnostic codes**

I’m finalizing the top five psychiatric diagnoses and their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes. After careful consideration, I’ve listed:

1. Obsessive-compulsive disorder - F42
2. Generalized anxiety disorder - F41.1
3. Other specified anxiety disorder - F41.8
4. Other specified depressive disorder - F32.8
5. Specific phobia, situational type - F40.298

This selection balances the potential comorbidities while remaining within the user’s parameters. I’m staying focused on the user’s request for a straightforward list without any reasoning, just the diagnoses as instructed!

**Finalizing diagnostic codes**

I'm focusing on crafting the final list of psychiatric diagnoses related to anxiety and depression. Here it is:

1. Obsessive-compulsive disorder - F42
2. Generalized anxiety disorder - F41.1
3. Panic disorder - F41.0
4. Other specified depressive disorder - F32.8
5. Specific phobia, situational type - F40.298

However, considering his anxiety symptoms may be better captured by unspecified anxiety, I'm leaning towards including that instead. But for clarity, I’m sticking with this final list while noting the importance of proper formatting for easy reference!","1. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) - F42

1002,"Emil is a 22 year old male that reports “my mom wanted us to meet because she spent her whole first therapy session talking to another therapist at her new program about how she feels I need help; I suspect it has to do with my multiple sclerosis (MS), recently losing my fiancé (Lizzy), and after loosing my dog that came with my fiancé. I also lost my career as a farmer.” The patient reports “My girlfriend and I had a good relationship when I used to be able to fish with her; she was a blue blood from the Cape.” Patient reports that he survived being “attacked when I was at a local bar about 4 years ago; the guy smashed a few beer bottles on my head; I had to go to the hospital and they did brain scans; I don’t remember what they said they found.” Patient reports that after that attack, he stopped fishing and started drinking alcohol heavily, at least 8 standard drinks per day, resulting in him missing work, the end of his relationship with his girlfriend, and resulted in getting two DUIs. Patient remembers, “I tried cutting down, but I was never able to do it.” The patient has been sober from alcohol for 76 days now. He denied any other drug use. Patient reports that around two years ago, “I was starting having another MS flare, I stopped being able to sleep for about two weeks and felt angry all the time.” Patient reports during that time he took several last minute trips to Baltimore by train, trying to start a new business and during that time had many sexual indiscretions. He states “people said I was acting strange and that I claimed I was a celebrity that was going to find a cure for autism.” Emil states “I felt like I had endless energy and could take on the world.” The patient reports no similar episodes like that since then, and denied any major mood symptoms since that time. Emil denied recent or past hallucinations, paranoia or thought insertion. Emil reports he never experienced trauma, with the exception of losing his girlfriend and dog. The patient denied any recent problems with depressed, sad, or hopeless mood, and denied problems recent problems with decreased need for sleep and associated elevated energy, racing thoughts, pressured speech or feelings of euphoria. He denied recent or past anxiety or panic, nor OCD.","Bipolar disorder, most recent episode manic, in remission (F31.74), Alcohol use disorder, initial remission (F10.21), Mood disorder due to a known physiologic condition with manic features (F06.33)",,judah_weathers,,,,"**Identifying Psychiatric Diagnoses**

I need to determine the top five ""DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses"" requested. We could include ""Alcohol use disorder"" and ""Bipolar I disorder,"" and maybe ""Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition."" We should avoid any duplicates. I wonder if comorbidities like ""Gambling disorder"" or ""Antisocial behavior"" would fit, but not likely. Considering ""Persistent complex bereavement disorder"" might be relevant since he lost multiple significant things, but we can't assume he has it without enough evidence.

**Clarifying Possible Diagnoses**

I'm considering potential diagnoses, like ""Major depressive disorder,"" but since he denies depressive symptoms, that doesn't fit. ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" doesn't seem right either. Maybe ""Other specified bipolar and related disorder"" if he had a manic episode lasting two weeks. I should rule out conditions like ""Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition"" and ""Substance/medication-induced bipolar disorder."" Other possibilities could be ""Posttraumatic stress disorder"" or ""Generalized anxiety disorder,"" but he denies those symptoms. I need to focus on the top five most likely diagnoses while keeping in mind those with lower probabilities.

**Determining Diagnoses Based on Information**

I realize that I need to keep my analysis strictly based on the provided information. While ""Alcohol-induced anxiety disorder"" isn't applicable, I could consider differential diagnoses related to mania and irritability, especially in the context of multiple sclerosis (MS). I think ""Bipolar I disorder"" is a possibility, alongside ""Substance/medication-induced bipolar disorder,"" which might occur if corticosteroids were used during MS flare-ups. However, I can't assume they were. ""Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition"" seems plausible too, as does considering traumatic brain injury. But I'm unsure about including unspecified personality disorders.

**Exploring Additional Diagnoses**

I'm thinking through the potential inclusion of F06.33 for medical-condition-induced mania, but I realize I can't specify multiple conditions separately. Instead, I could use ""Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition,"" referencing MS or TBI. I might also consider codes like ""Alcohol-induced bipolar and related disorder"" (F10.94) or ""Unspecified mood disorder."" Other possibilities could be ""Other specified bipolar and related disorder"" if there's another cause for mania. I'm contemplating ""Narcissistic personality disorder"" for grandiosity, or an ""Impulse-control disorder"" for questionable actions. But I'm unsure since he denies certain symptoms.

**Evaluating Potential Diagnoses**

I'm trying to generate five plausible diagnoses based on the user's situation. ""Alcohol-induced psychotic disorder"" isn't a fit, but I can explore others. I think ""Bipolar I disorder"" is a main candidate, along with ""Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition"" since he has MS. Other potentials include ""Substance/medication-induced bipolar disorder."" I'm looking at ""Posttraumatic stress disorder"" for his past trauma but he's denying symptoms. I also wonder about ""Prolonged grief disorder""—the new code might fit, even if he denies depressed mood. 

There’s a lot to think about regarding his history of mania, stressors, and the possibility of misdiagnosis. My approach should prioritize accuracy based on current evidence while also acknowledging plausible differentials. I want to avoid pure speculation but need to keep the user’s request for plausible diagnoses in mind. Let's focus on what fits best!

**Analyzing Diagnoses and Codes**

I’m reviewing symptoms that suggest a bipolar disorder diagnosis. For mania, I need at least four symptoms, like decreased need for sleep, grandiosity, increased goal-directed activity, risky behaviors, and potential irritability. However, it seems I can establish a strong case for mania based on these.

The primary diagnosis could be ""Bipolar I disorder"" or possibly ""Bipolar and related disorder due to another condition,"" like his MS. I'd also consider his history of alcohol use and the potential effects of medications, but I want to ensure accurate coding. It looks like I can include both ""Bipolar I disorder"" and ""Alcohol use disorder, severe, in early remission."" I need to double-check these codes for accuracy.

**Determining Alcohol Use Disorder Diagnosis**

I’m navigating the DSM-5 and ICD-10-CM coding for alcohol use disorder. Initially, I realized that while F10.20 is used for moderate/severe cases, the remission category actually has specific codes. It’s important to clarify that for the user’s case, he’s been sober for 76 days, which doesn't meet the three-month early remission requirement. Technically, I should classify him as ""Alcohol use disorder, severe"" without a remission specifier. I also need to note that a diagnosis remains valid regardless of abstinence. Therefore, I’ll stick with ""Alcohol use disorder, severe"" for accuracy.

**Evaluating Bipolar I Disorder and Alcohol Use**

I’m analyzing the diagnostic criteria for Bipolar I disorder and its connections with alcohol use disorder. It looks like full remission is possible since the user has maintained it for two years. I need to assess whether the manic episode was not due to substances or a medical condition, but it’s hard to confirm. I think I can classify the primary diagnosis as Alcohol Use Disorder since it's currently more relevant, with Bipolar I disorder following. I’m listing potential diagnoses while ensuring I align with the coding conventions accurately.

**Analyzing Diagnoses and Codes**

I need to ensure I'm providing the correct F codes related to the user's situation. They requested five diagnoses, which may include ""Alcohol use disorder"" and ""Bipolar I disorder."" I’m considering various options, like ""Bipolar and related disorder due to medical conditions"" and potentially ""Posttraumatic stress disorder."" However, I need to be cautious about what’s actually supported by the evidence, avoiding any assumptions about symptoms that haven’t been clearly stated. I’ll make sure each diagnosis I include has a basis in fact to adhere to the user's request.

**Structuring Diagnoses**

I need to consider relevant F codes based on the user's case. ""Alcohol use disorder"" and ""Bipolar I disorder"" seem likely, but I’m also weighing options like ""Postconcussional syndrome"" and ""Prolonged grief disorder."" While some of these diagnoses aren't strongly supported by symptoms, stressors in the case could still make them plausible. It appears I need to present five diagnoses, even if some are less certain. I'll focus on ensuring they're reasonable and align with the provided details.

**Designing Differential Diagnoses**

I’m trying to figure out the best F-codes for substance/medication-induced bipolar disorder. F19.94 seems like a candidate, but it focuses more on substance use rather than medication. Instead, I can consider ""Unspecified mood disorder"" (F39) and ""Alcohol use disorder"" (F10.20) as top diagnoses. It appears that ""Bipolar I disorder"" and ""Postconcussional syndrome"" are also plausible. I'll create a five-diagnosis list, staying mindful of supportive evidence even if some diagnoses feel more speculative. It’s about balancing the possible with the plausible!

**Clarifying Diagnoses**

I’m analyzing the vignette to establish appropriate diagnoses, primarily focusing on alcohol use disorder and bipolar disorder. Symptoms of depression and anxiety aren’t present, so including ""Alcohol use disorder"" and ""Bipolar I disorder"" seems essential. I’m considering various possibilities such as ""Unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder"" and ""Prolonged grief disorder,"" though they might have thin evidence. I want to stick with five suitable F-coded diagnoses, mindful of potential overlaps, but clarity in naming conditions is crucial! Let’s refine that list a bit!

**Finalizing Diagnoses**

I’m considering the diagnosis options based on the information available. I can include ""Bipolar I disorder"" and ""Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition."" To complete the top five diagnoses, I think about ""Alcohol use disorder"" as a primary option, noting its clear presence. I might list ""Posttraumatic stress disorder,"" ""Prolonged grief disorder,"" and ""Adjustment disorder."" I need to ensure I provide the appropriate ICD-10 F-codes, like F10.20 for alcohol use disorder and F31.74 for bipolar disorder.

**Compiling Differential Diagnoses**

I’m evaluating the potential diagnoses needed for this case. It seems likely to prioritize ""Bipolar I disorder"" and ""Alcohol Use Disorder."" Since the primary diagnosis could depend on which condition is more significant, I’m leaning toward ""Alcohol use disorder, severe"" due to its impact. For secondary diagnoses, I’ll include ""Bipolar I disorder,"" ""Bipolar and related disorder due to multiple sclerosis,"" and possibly ""Posttraumatic stress disorder."" Additionally, I want to finalize all associated ICD-10 F-codes for accuracy, ensuring we meet the top-five requirement.

**Evaluating Diagnostic Codes**

I’m trying to compile the necessary diagnoses for this case. It appears that mentioning ""Bipolar and related disorder due to traumatic brain injury"" is plausible, especially since there’s a past injury. I need to be careful with the ICD codes—specifically ensuring not to repeat F06.33. Including ""Alcohol use disorder"" and ""Bipolar I disorder"" makes sense, plus maybe ""Adjustment disorder"" or “Posttraumatic stress disorder.” I’ll finalize potential F-codes to confirm my options align with diagnostic criteria, while avoiding any speculation that could mislead.

**Finalizing Diagnostic Considerations**

I’m working on building a final list of diagnoses, leaning toward established codes. I think including ""Alcohol-induced mood disorder"" as a differential could apply, but it might be more beneficial to focus on conditions directly tied to what the patient is experiencing. Since we don't have much evidence for PTSD, it could be added as a possibility as well. 

Here's a potential list of diagnoses:

1. Alcohol use disorder, severe - F10.20
2. Bipolar I disorder, most recent episode manic, in full remission - F31.74
3. Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition - F06.33
4. Posttraumatic stress disorder - F43.10
5. Adjustment disorder, unspecified - F43.20 

I’m trying to ensure clarity while reflecting the patient’s situation accurately!

**Evaluating Diagnostic Options**

I’m considering including ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder,"" but I think ""Adjustment disorder, unspecified"" F43.20 might fit better due to the significant stressors he’s facing. However, he denies having symptoms.

I'm pondering the inclusion of ""Alcohol-induced mood disorder"" to account for any mood symptoms that might be alcohol-related, even though it’s tricky since mood episodes might overlap with his drinking history.

Ultimately, I'm striving to create a list of the top five most likely diagnoses based on the context:

1. Alcohol use disorder, severe - F10.20
2. Bipolar I disorder, most recent episode manic, in full remission - F31.74
3. Bipolar disorder due to another medical condition (multiple sclerosis) - F06.33
4. Posttraumatic stress disorder - F43.10
5. Adjustment disorder, unspecified - F43.20

I’m still wrestling with the choices, though!

**Refining Diagnostic Considerations**

I’m re-evaluating the potential for a ""Hypomanic episode"" since there wasn’t marked impairment, and grandiosity could be non-delusional. Without a major depressive episode, diagnosing bipolar II isn't possible, but I could consider ""Other specified bipolar and related disorder"" F31.89.

I’m aiming to include a comprehensive list of the top five most likely diagnoses while reflecting on his symptoms, losing track of new possibilities like PTSD or adjustment disorders. I want to focus on mood-related conditions for clarity. Here’s what I’m thinking:

1. Alcohol use disorder, severe - F10.20
2. Bipolar I disorder, most recent episode manic, in full remission - F31.74
3. Bipolar disorder due to another medical condition (multiple sclerosis), with manic features - F06.33
4. Substance/medication-induced bipolar disorder - F19.94
5. Unspecified bipolar and related disorder - F31.9

This list captures his situation without introducing unnecessary complexity!

**Clarifying Diagnostic Options**

I’m examining whether prolonged grief or postconcussional syndrome fits into the user's case, considering that prolonged grief needs time to manifest and postconcussional syndrome requires specific symptoms. There might be a link to a brain injury from trauma. The user's brain scans could indicate cognitive issues, but confirming that is tricky.

For diagnostics, including ""Prolonged grief disorder"" could be plausible, as he mentioned losing significant figures in his life. I want to compile the final top five diagnoses:

1. Alcohol use disorder, severe - F10.20
2. Bipolar I disorder, in full remission - F31.74
3. Bipolar disorder due to multiple sclerosis - F06.33
4. Posttraumatic stress disorder - F43.10
5. Adjustment disorder (or potentially prolonged grief disorder) - F43.20

This list accommodates the symptoms and circumstances mentioned!

**Finalizing Diagnostic List**

I’m working to clarify diagnoses based on what the user has shared. The user's mention of losing both his fiancé and dog suggests a break-up rather than death, which shifts the focus away from prolonged grief disorder. Instead, I should consider whether to include adjustment disorder due to relationship loss or perhaps some unspecified trauma-related disorder. 

Here's my finalized list of top five plausible diagnoses:

1. Alcohol use disorder, severe - F10.20  
2. Bipolar I disorder, most recent episode manic, in full remission - F31.74  
3. Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition (multiple sclerosis), with manic features - F06.33  
4. Other specified bipolar and related disorder (hypomanic episode) - F31.89  
5. Adjustment disorder, unspecified - F43.20  

This approach offers a good overview while staying consistent with criteria!

**Refining Diagnostic List**

I’m refining my approach to determine the necessary diagnoses for the user. It seems best to include top options like Alcohol use disorder and Bipolar I disorder. However, I’m considering whether to include “Substance/medication-induced bipolar disorder” and ensuring proper ICD-10 codes, like F06.33 for bipolar due to a medical condition. 

My finalized list of five plausible diagnoses will be:

1. Alcohol use disorder, severe - F10.20  
2. Bipolar I disorder, most recent episode manic, in full remission - F31.74  
3. Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition (multiple sclerosis), with manic features - F06.33  
4. Posttraumatic stress disorder - F43.10  
5. Adjustment disorder, unspecified - F43.20  

All these align with DSM-5-TR criteria!

**Finalizing Diagnostic Options**

I need to decide on the top diagnoses for the user, focusing on five clear options. “Other specified” could be useful, but I want to ensure it reflects valid symptoms and criteria. I can go with:

1. Alcohol use disorder, severe - F10.20
2. Bipolar I disorder, most recent episode manic, in full remission - F31.74
3. Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition (MS), with manic features - F06.33
4. Other specified bipolar and related disorder - F31.89
5. Posttraumatic stress disorder - F43.10

This list captures a range of potential issues accurately.

**Crafting Diagnostic List**

I’m finalizing a structured list of potential psychiatric diagnoses for the user. The diagnoses I’m considering include:

1. Alcohol use disorder, moderate to severe - F10.20
2. Bipolar I disorder, most recent episode manic, in full remission - F31.74
3. Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition (multiple sclerosis), with manic features - F06.33

1003,"Neveah is a 14 year old girl that comes to her pediatrician with her mother (presently 4 months pregnant) due to “out of control behaviors at home.” The patient appears restless in the exam room and requiring redirection from her mother throughout the visit. The patient frequently punches her mother in the legs, and in the stomach, and the patient even threw her ipad at the pediatrician when she asked the patient what was upsetting her. Most of the patients psychiatric history is gathered from her mother, given how irritable the patient is during the exam. The mother reports Neveah was born 8 weeks pre-mature, spent about 1 month in the neonatal intensive care unit due to problems with breathing, and ultimately discharged home to her care at one month of age. The patient met developmental milestones on or near expected time, and was “clingy” when she was a toddler, but had no problems making friends in daycare and grade school. When patient was about 11 years of age, her biological father left the home to join the military, and has deployed ever since. Around 12 years of age, around summertime, the patient appeared much more talkative, energetic, and would go several days only needing about 3 hours of sleep at night. She was more impulsive during these times, and believed she had super powers to “make her friends get in trouble at school”, even when she was not at school herself. She was never tired the following day. During that same period, she had many temper tantrums throughout the day, almost every day of the week, that seemed disproportionate to circumstances, like having to have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich instead of a peanut butter and fluff sandwich. The tantrums would last several hours in a day. This pattern of behavior would last for several weeks at a time, with periods of months returning to normal mood and behavior. The patient never appeared to be hallucination or responding to internal stimuli, and never appeared sad or depressed. Neveah had to be hospitalized during an episode like this when she was 13 years old. Neveah refuses to take medications for her symptoms. The start of this year academic year, that patient appeared more calm and in good behavioral control, but began to have similar symptoms of irritability, violence at home, not needing to sleep, talking fast, and property destruction at home.","Bipolar disorder, current episode manic (F31.2)",,judah_weathers,,,,"**Verifying ICD-10 codes**

I want to ensure I use the right codes for the user. The question specifies F-codes (ICD-10), but I think I should stick to clinical codes (ICD-10-CM) for better accuracy. I'll verify each code one by one.

For DMDD, the code is F34.81, and I think that’s correct. For IED, it's F63.81, also correct. ODD uses F91.3, and ADHD combined is F90.2. 

For Bipolar I mania, we might use F31.13 for severe manic episodes, or F31.2 if there are psychotic features. But my decision needs to consider if those features are present. So I'd like to choose the most appropriate code here.

**Examining mania criteria**

I need to look closely at the criteria for mania. It involves impairment, and severe mania often includes psychotic features or leads to hospitalization. Since hospitalization occurred, that suggests severe mania, right? 

The severity specifier can be mild, moderate, or severe, and hospitalization implies severe impairment. So, I can see we're leaning toward coding this as severe. For the ICD-10, I think F31.13 fits for a manic episode that's severe without psychotic symptoms. The user mentioned just an F-code, but F31.13 is still within that range. I’m feeling confident about this choice!

**Confirming ICD-10 F-codes**

Let's solidify my memory of the ICD-10 codes. F31.1 refers to ""Bipolar disorder, current episode manic without psychotic features,"" and there are subcodes for severity. So, F31.11 is mild, F31.12 is moderate, and F31.13 is severe.

For F31.2, that indicates ""Bipolar disorder, current episode manic with psychotic features."" We might have F31.21 as a further classification for severity there.

Since the prompt expects general F-codes rather than specifying subtypes, it makes sense to stick with simpler codes like F31.1; decimals like F34.81 are still acceptable, as they’re within the criteria.

**Listing top diagnoses**

I need to present the top 5 diagnoses in order without reasoning. The primary diagnosis should be the most likely based on the vignette, which is bipolar I disorder, current episode manic. 

For the secondary diagnoses, I’m considering DMDD, ODD, IED, and ADHD, but I might want to specify ""Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe, without psychotic features"" as the primary. 

Other possibilities to include in the differential could be conduct disorder. However, given the strong indication of mania, I'd lean away from DMDD. I’ll finalize the list now.

**Determining top diagnoses**

We need to list the top 5 diagnoses, prioritizing the most likely one based on the observed symptoms. I think bipolar I disorder should be our primary diagnosis. For the secondary diagnoses, I can consider Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD), Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and Intermittent explosive disorder (IED).

Given the symptoms, ADHD can mimic mania, DMDD aligns with irritability, ODD fits with aggression towards authority, and IED relates to aggressive outbursts. Conduct disorder could also be an option, so I’ll weigh whether to include that. I'll finalize the list!

1004,"Elain is a 63 year old mother of 5 children and 12 grandchildren, that presents to urgent care with a chief complaint of “I’m hallucinating.” Elain reports no history of depression or manic, and was in her usual state of health until 27 days ago when she witnessed a pedestrian be struck by a moving vehicle in her neighborhood. Elain tried to rescue the pedestrian, and even helped paramedics the responded to the scene provide chest compressions to the pedestrian. Unfortunately the pedestrian was pronounced dead on the scene. Since then, Elain has felt a sense of “dread” and “anxiety” everyday, and feels like every time she hears a cars wheels skid in the street, “I jump out of my skin.” The patient also reports that, when at work, she will have these persistent images of the pedestrian laying in the street, and “I just can’t get the images out of my head.” Elain reports that wakes two or three times a night with nightmares related to the event. Additionally, Elain herself has avoided drying, for fear she will be involved in a car accident herself. She was at work today and decided to come to urgent care because “I was hallucinating” and “I was at my desk and suddenly felt like my body separated from my mind, and I could see myself sitting at my desks, as if I was hovering from above.” Patient denied disorganized speech, thought insertion or thought broadcasting. She denied visual or auditory hallucinations.",Acute stress disorder (F43.0),,judah_weathers,,,,"**Determining suitable F-codes**

The user is asking for specific ICD-10 F-codes, and I think F40.248 could be appropriate. However, F40.20 for ""Phobic anxiety disorder, unspecified"" might also work. In the ICD-10-CM, F40.298 is for ""Other phobic anxiety disorders,"" so I’m considering F40.248 for specificity. The avoidance of driving could relate to trauma and potentially lead to phobias. I’ll need to ensure the selected codes reflect her symptoms accurately while considering secondary diagnoses like PTSD or Generalized anxiety disorder. It's important to analyze all factors carefully.

**Assessing ASD criteria**

I’m looking into the DSM criteria for Acute Stress Disorder (ASD). First, there's the need for exposure to a traumatic event, which she has experienced by witnessing a death. Next, I need to identify 9 or more symptoms from specific categories like intrusion and avoidance. So far, I note symptoms like intrusive memories, nightmares, and some avoidance of driving. However, I’m only counting about 6 symptoms. While she experiences sleep disturbances and anxiety, it seems I still need to find more symptoms to meet the criteria for a diagnosis.

**Reviewing ASD symptoms**

I’m considering symptoms to meet the ASD criteria. I can include recurrent distressing memories and dreams, which gives me two symptoms right away. Hearing car skidding also causes intense distress, adding more to the list. I recognize I have some possible symptoms, like avoidance of driving, which counts as another, but I'm still sitting at around 7 total. The DSM requires 9 symptoms for ASD, so I don’t think this is enough based on what I have. I'll stick to the information given.

**Considering diagnostic options**

I need to be cautious here. If there aren’t enough symptoms for Acute Stress Disorder (ASD), I could think about ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder"" instead. She shows multiple symptoms across clusters, but we may not meet the threshold due to limited information. Even so, I might still lean towards diagnosing ASD if it seems plausible. The challenge is that ASD requires at least nine symptoms, and I’ve only identified about seven so far. However, I can consider if certain phrases could give me extra symptoms, like interpreting ""dread"" as negative mood.

**Evaluating diagnostic criteria**

I’m analyzing the symptoms related to Acute Stress Disorder (ASD). The user's description shows signs of physiological reactivity and startle responses, marking potential symptoms. However, I must be cautious with double counting. From what I summarize, she has expressions of dread and anxiety, but I notice the DSM specifies a persistent inability to experience positive emotions for the negative mood category, which she doesn't seem to meet. Given the symptoms, an alternative diagnosis like ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder"" might fit better, especially since she might not meet the nine required symptoms for ASD. So, I'll consider those possibilities more carefully.

**Determining the best diagnosis**

I’m analyzing the symptoms relevant to trauma and stress-related disorders. The user presents a mix of intrusion, avoidance, and arousal symptoms, but I'm noticing some criteria aren't fully met for Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) or PTSD. Given her situation, “Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder” might be more fitting. Although ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety"" seems appropriate, ASD remains stronger as a primary diagnosis given the timing and symptoms. I’ll lay out my final top five diagnoses to make this clearer.

**Analyzing potential diagnoses**

I’m evaluating the symptoms presented to determine accurate diagnoses. The user denies hallucinations but mentions an out-of-body experience, which might suggest dissociation rather than a psychotic disorder. Other possible diagnoses include Generalized Anxiety Disorder or Specific Phobia, but her symptoms lean more towards trauma-related disorders. I’m considering Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) as well as PTSD, Adjustment Disorder, and possibly dissociative disorders. I need to rank the top five diagnoses based on the information available to ensure we capture what’s most likely.

**Refining diagnoses considerations**

I’m reflecting on the diagnostic criteria concerning the symptoms presented. I realize that she has only one symptom for the negative mood category of Acute Stress Disorder (ASD), and merely interpreting phrases like ""images in my head"" could lead to assumptions about negative symptoms. She might have some indicators for dissociation or hypervigilance, but the total doesn’t meet the requirements for ASD. I need to determine the top five likely diagnoses, ensuring I align with the ICD-10 codes properly while avoiding any fabrications in the details.

**Choosing potential diagnoses**

I'm assessing the possibility of various diagnoses for the patient based on the provided symptoms. It's clear that we need to identify five diagnoses, and I’m weighing Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) as the primary option. There’s also room for ""Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder"" as an alternative. I’m trying to ensure accuracy with the ICD-10 codes while considering each symptom's presence and relevance. Ultimately, I must adhere to the DSM-5 and balance diagnostic flexibility with the finite evidence from the vignette.

**Assessing potential diagnoses**

I'm analyzing the patient's symptoms and considering whether the car skid reaction indicates hypervigilance. I'm pondering if I could count certain symptoms as meeting acute stress disorder (ASD) criteria, like persistent images and exaggerated startle. However, since the symptoms don't fully meet the standard, I’m leaning towards “Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder” as the primary diagnosis instead. Ultimately, I should select the top five most plausible diagnoses, ensuring they're all applicable based on the provided vignette and ICD-10 coding.

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

I'm evaluating the patient's age and cognitive status, and I'm considering trauma-related disorders for diagnosis. While I initially thought about including bereavement, it doesn't quite apply here. So, my top choices are: 1) Acute stress disorder (F43.0), 2) Posttraumatic stress disorder (F43.10), 3) Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder (F43.8), 4) Adjustment disorder with anxiety (F43.22), and 5) Depersonalization/derealization disorder (F48.1). I'll ensure these codes are distinct and reflect the more likely diagnoses based on the symptoms described.

**Crafting final diagnosis list**

I'm digging into the ICD-10-CM codes to ensure I'm correct. My top five diagnoses will be: 1) Acute Stress Disorder - ICD-10 F43.0, 2) Posttraumatic Stress Disorder - ICD-10 F43.10, 3) Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder - ICD-10 F43.89, 4) Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety - ICD-10 F43.22, and 5) Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder - ICD-10 F48.1. I want to ensure the formatting and code accuracy are perfect while keeping the focus clear.

**Finalizing the diagnosis list**

I'm compiling the final list of diagnoses, and I want to ensure I'm using the right codes. For the third diagnosis, I'll choose Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder - ICD-10 F43.8, since it aligns well with DSM-5-TR mapping. I am confident in using F43.8 even if there might be discussions about its billability. My final ordered list is: 1) Acute Stress Disorder - F43.0; 2) Posttraumatic Stress Disorder - F43.10; 3) Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder - F43.8; 4) Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety - F43.22; 5) Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder - F48.1.","1.

1005,"A 19 year old male comes to his primary care off reporting “I think someone has poisoned me at home.” The patient reports that about two and a half months ago, after he lost his job at a local arcade, he started noticing that he was feeling more sleepy at home. He states “I would go to bed around 7 p.m., right after dinner, and not wake up until about 12 p.m. the next day.” He reports before that time, he would go to bed around 10:30 p.m. and wake for work around 6 a.m. He states, “I started to notice that my mom would take longer preparing my plate of food for dinner, and I felt sleepy right after.” He endorsed associated low energy, low motivation and problems with concentration starting around that time. Patient goes on to say “over the past two months, every afternoon when I wake up, I can hear my parents whispering through the vents of the house, planning on killing me and replacing me with a different person.” Patient states he will sometimes also “hear them whispering when I’m at the store getting food and stuff, even though they are all the way back at home.” The patient reports that when he logs onto his ipad to play video games, “I can tell that some of the other characters of the game are my parents pretending to be other people. They are trying to get into my head.” The patient reports over the past 3 weeks he has stopped eating dinner, remains withdrawn to his room, and keeps the shades drawn “because I don’t want them looking into my windows.” The patient denied any other similar periods of symptoms like this in the past, denied illicit substance use (patients urine toxicology returns negative of all substance), and denied recent head injury or seizure. He denied active thoughts, plans or intents of harm to self or others. There are no guns in the home. About halfway through the exam, that patient grabs his jacket and runs out of the doctors office stating “forget it, I can tell you are working with my parents to kill me too.",Schizophreniform Disorder (F20.81) or F33.3 (Depression with psychotic features),,judah_weathers,,,,"**Considering diagnoses ranking**

I think I should choose secondary diagnoses that still reflect plausible alternatives yet rank them by likelihood. The instructions ask for a structured list of the top five DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses based on age and symptoms. I’m considering: 

1. Schizophreniform disorder - F20.81
2. Schizophrenia, first episode (provisional) - F20.9
3. Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type - F25.1
4. Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe with psychotic features - F32.3
5. Delusional disorder, persecutory type - F22

But maybe substance-induced should rank higher due to the commonality of substance use in a 19-year-old with psychosis, even if tests came back negative.

**Refining differential diagnoses**

I think we should consider ""Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder"" since it’s quite common. However, the urine toxicology was negative for all substances, which is interesting because synthetic cannabinoids might not show. Instead, including ""Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder, unspecified substance"" - F19.959 as a secondary diagnosis seems wise. I’m also contemplating “Paranoid personality disorder” and “Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder” - F29 as catch-alls. 

Here's the proposed ranking:

1. Schizophreniform disorder - F20.81
2. Schizophrenia - F20.9
3. Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder - F19.959
4. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition - F06.2
5. Delusional disorder, persecutory type - F22

I’m thinking maybe the delusional disorder should come after medical causes, but a primary psychotic disorder is probably more common in a young adult.

**Evaluating mood disorders and psychosis**

I'm considering incorporating a mood disorder with psychotic features, like Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), into the differential diagnoses. Low energy and hypersomnia could support MDD, but his psychosis seems unrelated to mood. He denies any suicidal or homicidal thoughts, which is notable. 

However, I’m pondering whether a mood disorder is more plausible than a delusional disorder. Delusional disorder is rare in a 19-year-old and requires non-bizarre delusions without other psychotic symptoms, which he has. Mood disorder with psychotic features could fit, but his primary mood symptoms aren’t prominent enough. I might lean towards including the mood disorder anyway, even if delusional disorder seems very unlikely.

**Identifying secondary diagnoses**

I need to come up with four plausible secondary diagnoses for this 19-year-old dealing with acute onset psychotic symptoms after a stressor. Given the symptoms, I think schizophreniform is the most fitting diagnosis. 

For the differential, I’m considering schizophrenia, brief psychotic disorder (though duration isn't appropriate), and ""Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition"" or ""Substance-induced psychotic disorder,"" but the negative toxicology complicates that. 

Here are my selected secondary diagnoses:  
- Schizophrenia (F20.9)
- Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder (F19.959)
- Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition (F06.2)
- Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe with psychotic features (F32.3) or possibly ""Other specified depressive disorder"" (F32.8) since he doesn’t meet full criteria.

**Finalizing diagnoses selection**

I need to determine the top five DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses for the case. I could consider using ""Other specified depressive disorder"" (F32.8) to account for subthreshold depressive symptoms, but since evidence of psychosis seems more prominent, I’m leaning towards differentiating these conditions. 

For the secondary diagnoses, I'm considering:  
- Schizophrenia (F20.9) if symptoms extend beyond 6 months.  
- Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type (F25.1) due to depressive symptoms and hypersomnia.  
- Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe with psychotic features (F32.3), although it requires that psychosis coincides with mood.  
- Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder (F19.959), even with negative toxicology.  

In this case, maybe I should also include ""Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.2) but could be less likely due to the patient's age. Given all the symptoms and relationships, my final selections would cover the major categories for this first episode psychosis.

**Determining appropriate codes**

I’m looking into substance-induced psychotic disorders and considering codes like F19.959 for “other psychoactive substance-induced psychotic disorder, unspecified.” However, since there aren’t clear substances specified, I’m also pondering about F29, which is for unspecified psychosis but feels too general given the context.

I think I'd settle on specific and relevant secondary diagnoses like Schizophreniform disorder (F20.81), Schizophrenia (F20.9), and Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (F06.2). For the possible fourth diagnosis, Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features (F32.3) might suit, especially considering symptoms like low energy and hypersomnia, but I’ll weigh that against other options too.

**Evaluating potential disorders**

I'm considering whether to include ""Brief Psychotic Disorder"" (F23) as a secondary diagnosis but find it unlikely given the patient's symptoms over the past two months. Instead, ""Delusional Disorder, persecutory type"" (F22) seems plausible, despite it typically occurring in older individuals. 

Yet, with predominant hallucinations, I ponder if ""Schizoaffective Disorder, depressive type"" (F25.1) or ""Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features"" (F32.3) would work better for capturing the depressive components. I must also verify the correct DSM codes as I finalize the top five likely diagnoses.

**Choosing psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm trying to finalize the list of possible psychiatric diagnoses. First, I realize I need to clarify codes like F32.8 and F32.89 regarding depression, and the nuances between other specified depressive episodes.  

I'm focusing on selecting the main diagnoses we can be confident about, such as Schizophreniform Disorder (F20.81), Schizophrenia (F20.9), and Schizoaffective Disorder (F25.1). I also need to include substance-induced options, but since the patient denies substance use, I consider how to frame that within the context demanded. I aim for a concise, accurate top five list of diagnoses!

**Finalizing psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm trying to structure my list of psychiatric diagnoses with corresponding F-codes. My top choices include Schizophreniform Disorder (F20.81), Schizophrenia (F20.9), and Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder (F19.959). However, there's a lot to consider about mood symptoms versus psychosis. I may also go with a diagnosis like Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (F06.2) since we're seeing new onset psychosis. I just need to ensure that these five fit well based on the context of the information provided!

**Determining psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm trying to finalize a list of psychiatric diagnoses focusing on the most fitting options and their corresponding F-codes. I'm considering Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features (F32.3) but wondering if Delusional Disorder might be more appropriate. Given the symptoms of hallucinations and delusions, I might also contemplate Schizoaffective Disorder. For substance-induced psychosis, I’m checking the codes, weighing whether to use F19.959 or F19.951, but I need to ensure accuracy without overcommitting. I must focus on the best classifications based on presented symptoms!

**Finalizing psychiatric diagnosis codes**

I'm refining a list of psychiatric diagnoses and their ICD-10 codes. While considering codes, I realize I should favor DSM-5-CM mappings, which impact how I categorize these disorders. I'm contemplating including Schizophreniform Disorder, Schizophrenia, and Psychotic Disorder due to another medical condition. I also need to accurately represent Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder (unspecified substance) and Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features. I’m ranking these based on likelihood, ensuring I provide five clear lines for the final structured list!

**Finalizing psychiatric diagnosis codes**

I’m compiling the final list of psychiatric diagnoses with their ICD-10 codes. Considering the complexities, I’m including Major Depressive Disorder, Schizophreniform Disorder, and Psychotic Disorder due to another medical condition, among others.

1006,"Stacy is a 54 year old Navy Veteran that comes to the emergency room complaining of “I feel like bugs are crawling all over me.” Patient reports this started about 36 hours ago after returning home from an elective surgical procedure (the patient had a ‘tummy tuck’). Following her surgeons orders, the patient has been on bed rest, abstaining from heavy activity. The patient reports “I also feel incredibly thirsty and I’m shaking like a leaf.” She denied any recent head trauma, and denied history of strokes or seizures. She lives alone in an apartment downtown. She I’ve lost a lot of friends over the years, so I mostly just stay home and delivery food if I’m hungry.” She reports “I have 4 or 5 beers a day”, stating she does not drink more than that “because I’ve been taking Klonopin for about 15 years and those two things do not mix.” The patient does admit, “my PCP stopped prescribing my Klonopin about a year ago, so I buy them from an online dispensary.” She acknowledges sometimes having a beer and Klonopin in the morning, “just to keep the shakes down.” On chart review, you see that the patient has also gone to several local emergency rooms over the past 2 years, with urine toxicology positive for alcohol, benzodiazepines, opiates and amphetamines, although in the controlled substance prescribing database, you see that the patient has never been prescribed opiates or amphetamines. Upon further questioning, that patient does acknowledges she has tried cutting back on alcohol use, since her family and friends has said “it seems like its taking over my life.” Unfortunately, she has not achieved any lengthy sobriety, and has actually found she is drinking more over the past year to achieve a similar effect. Blood labs on this visit indicate severely low sodium and potassium. Patient denied visual hallucinations, auditory hallucinations and denied sad or depressed mood.","Polysubstance use disorder, severe (F19.20); Alcohol use, with unspecified alcohol induced disorder (i.e. Beer Pantomania) (F10.99)",,judah_weathers,,,,"**Determining diagnoses**

I need to identify the top 5 diagnoses. I'm considering including Alcohol Use Disorder (severe), Benzodiazepine Use Disorder, Stimulant Use Disorder, and Opioid Use Disorder. The acute presentation might involve withdrawal, and I should decide which condition is primary. I’m leaning towards Alcohol Withdrawal or Delirium due to potential tactile hallucinations and severe electrolyte imbalances observed. I have to choose carefully to fill all 5 slots while focusing on DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses.

**Identifying primary and secondary diagnoses**

I think the primary diagnosis should be Alcohol Withdrawal with perceptual disturbances, especially since it followed abrupt cessation after surgery. For secondary diagnoses, I'm considering severe Alcohol Use Disorder, Sedative Use Disorder, Stimulant Use Disorder, and Opioid Use Disorder. Alternatively, I could include Sedative Withdrawal instead of a use disorder. The user’s shaking suggests withdrawal symptoms from either alcohol or benzodiazepines. It’s unclear if she's still using those substances because of her post-op situation. She mentions drinking daily but doesn’t clarify if she stopped since the surgery.

**Evaluating symptoms and potential diagnoses**

The symptoms like thirst, shaking, and tactile hallucinations suggest withdrawal, but could it be delirium tremens? The onset of symptoms 36 hours after reduction is within the typical timeframe. However, without confusion or disorientation, it's probably not delirium tremens. I think ""Alcohol Withdrawal with Perceptual Disturbances"" fits better. The lab results show low sodium and potassium, which can also cause confusion or tremors. Although I’m considering ""Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder,"" she doesn’t seem to have delusions, making ""Alcohol Withdrawal"" a more appropriate diagnosis.

**Considering alternative diagnoses**

I’m evaluating “Alcohol-Induced Psychotic Disorder” as it involves tactile hallucinations alongside tremors, but this occurs during or right after heavy drinking. While she has tactile hallucinations, she denies auditory or visual ones, so I'm leaning toward withdrawal symptoms. Although stimulant intoxication is possible, there’s no evidence of recent use. Given her previous positive tests for amphetamines, perhaps she had used them for energy? Ultimately, I think “Alcohol Withdrawal with Perceptual Disturbances” would be the primary diagnosis, coding as F10.232 or F10.239, depending on the specifics.

**Evaluating diagnoses and coding**

I’m weighing the ICD-10 codes for the potential diagnoses related to alcohol withdrawal. For instance, F10.239 indicates unspecified withdrawal. I think F10.232 fits her case, as it includes perceptual disturbances. While there’s also consideration for sedative withdrawal, the primary diagnosis could be ""Alcohol Withdrawal with Perceptual Disturbances."" 

The user’s symptoms, including tactile hallucinations and severe thirst, suggest withdrawal or possible metabolic issues. I should consider including severe Alcohol Use Disorder and possibly stimulant and opioid use disorders as secondary diagnoses. I’ll focus on identifying the top five diagnoses based on the available symptoms.

**Assessing withdrawal and diagnoses**

I'm analyzing the potential causes of symptoms like shaking, thirst, and possible hallucinations. It could be due to withdrawal from alcohol or benzodiazepines, or even electrolyte imbalances like hypokalemia. She’s reported tactile sensations but denies visual or auditory hallucinations. Given the history of using substances like Klonopin, her symptoms may suggest substance-induced conditions. 

I believe the top diagnoses should include ""Alcohol withdrawal with perceptual disturbance,” severe “Alcohol use disorder,” and possibly benzodiazepine and stimulant use disorders. I’ll make sure to provide the appropriate DSM-5-TR diagnoses and ICD-10 codes.

**Confirming diagnostics codes**

I'm going through the codes regarding alcohol use and withdrawal, trying to clarify which to use. The primary diagnosis may be ""Alcohol withdrawal with perceptual disturbance"" (F10.232), which suggests dependence already. However, I ponder if it’s beneficial to list ""Alcohol use disorder, severe"" (F10.20) separately too—I might be overcomplicating things.

I’m considering adding benzodiazepine, opioid, and stimulant use disorders as secondary diagnoses. It seems we could establish a solid top 5 of diagnoses while being cautious about redundancy. It’s a tangled web, but I’ll sort it out!

**Clarifying diagnostic codes**

I'm diving into the DSM-5 codes for alcohol use and withdrawal to clarify what I should use. For instance, if I'm coding alcohol dependence with perceptual disturbance, I'd use F10.232. I wonder if I also need to include F10.20 for alcohol use disorder—however, that might be unnecessary because the first code implies dependence already.

I’m looking to structure my list of top 5 diagnoses, aiming for clarity without redundancy. Alcohol withdrawal seems primary, while I’ll highlight other substance use disorders as secondary as I pinpoint crucial details!

**Assessing potential diagnoses**

I’m looking at the case details: the patient is isolated, experiencing acute thirst and shakes after surgery, possibly indicating withdrawal. She has history with alcohol, Klonopin, and other substances. There are a few symptoms — like tactile hallucinations — that could be due to alcohol withdrawal or benzodiazepine withdrawal. 

I need to compile a structured list of top 5 likely diagnoses, keeping in mind both substance use and withdrawal effects, including any relevant metabolic factors without creating assumptions. I have to be precise!

**Determining primary diagnoses**

I'm trying to figure out which diagnosis to label as primary and which should be secondary. Given the acute symptoms, it seems ""Alcohol withdrawal with perceptual disturbance"" should be primary. The underlying ""Alcohol use disorder"" code can be captured but might not need to be listed separately to avoid redundancy. 

I also need to consider potential sedative use and other substance disorders based on her usage patterns. I'm working to ensure the list comprises the top five diagnoses while addressing any code conflicts, always keeping in line with the specific request provided.

**Choosing diagnostic codes**

I'm settling on F10.232 for alcohol withdrawal due to its moderate/severe indication. For alcohol use disorder, I’ll go with F10.20 since it clearly outlines dependence. I also think F13.20 is suitable for sedative use disorder given the long-term illicit usage.

As for opioid use disorder, I’m leaning towards F11.10 because of repeated positive UDS results, but being cautious since it's not definitively established. Including stimulant use is tricky; I might list ""Substance-induced psychotic disorder"" with the appropriate code due to her symptoms. Overall, I need a clear, concise top five diagnoses.

**Assessing symptoms and diagnoses**

The patient's onset of symptoms began about 36 hours ago after returning home from surgery, suggesting a withdrawal process may have started during her hospital stay. She's showing signs like thirst and low sodium which could indicate dehydration. For the top five diagnoses, I lean towards including: 

1. Alcohol withdrawal with perceptual disturbances (F10.232)
2. Alcohol use disorder, severe (F10.20)
3. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, severe (F13.20)
4. Stimulant use disorder (F15.20 or F15.10)
5. Opioid use disorder (F11.20 or F11.10).

I must ensure these align with DSM-5-TR designations accurately.

**Determining diagnoses**

I’m contemplating including ""Other substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder"" due to tactile hallucinations possibly from amphetamines, but there’s no current evidence supporting this. The patient's intense thirst and tremors could indicate stimulant use. Considering these symptoms, I’m outlining the top five likely diagnoses:

1. Alcohol withdrawal, with perceptual disturbance - F10.232
2. Alcohol use disorder, severe - F10.20
3. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, severe - F13.20
4. Stimulant use disorder - F15.20
5. Delirium due to another medical condition - F05. 

Now, I must ensure these align with ICD-10 codes provided correctly.

**Finalizing diagnoses list**

I’m considering how to categorize ""Opioid use"" since it doesn't fit DSM-5 explicitly. We could label it as ""Opioid use disorder"" based on repeated positive UDS without prescriptions, even though it's an assumption. Alternatively, ""Other substance use disorder"" could be useful for polysubstance use, capturing a broader range with the F19.20 code.

Based on the overall case details, I’m settling on the following top five diagnoses for this patient:

1. Alcohol withdrawal, with perceptual disturbance - F10.232
2. Alcohol use disorder, moderate to severe - F10.20
3. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, moderate to severe - F13.20
4. Opioid use disorder - F11.20
5. Stimulant (amphetamine-type) use disorder - F15.20.

**Determining diagnoses**

I'm weighing the possibility of categorizing the patient as having ""Unspecified psychotic disorder,"" but it might be better to focus on delirium instead. Given the vignette, the context is likely emphasizing alcohol withdrawal with symptoms like tactile hallucinations and electrolyte issues. 

After reviewing the case details, I propose these top five diagnoses:

1. Alcohol withdrawal with perceptual disturbance - F10.232
2. Alcohol use disorder, moderate/severe - F10.20
3. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder - F13.20
4. Stimulant (amphetamine-type) use disorder 
5. Opioid use disorder. 

However, I'm concerned about diagnosing opioid and stimulant use without stronger evidence.

**Analyzing withdrawal symptoms**

The patient denies several significant issues like depression, head trauma, or stroke history, which helps rule out certain neurologic conditions. The labs show low sodium and potassium levels, pointing to potential ""beer potomania."" This could indicate alcohol withdrawal or an alcohol-induced psychotic disorder.

When considering the patient's history and symptoms, my proposed list of diagnoses includes:

1. Alcohol withdrawal with perceptual disturbance - F10.232
2. Alcohol use disorder, moderate/severe - F10.20
3. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder - F13.20
4. Stimulant use disorder - F15.10
5. Opioid use disorder - F11.10

I have to rank these based on likelihood, ensuring to confirm appropriate ICD-10 codes.

**Determining substance use disorders**

For the diagnosis, I need to be cautious about labeling ""abuse,"" as the DSM uses ""use disorder."" I can specify ""Opioid use disorder” with code F11.10, which indicates mild. The same applies for stimulants with F15.10. 

Now, for alcohol, I grapple with whether to list it as ""Alcohol use disorder"" separately, especially since I'm already diagnosing withdrawal. However, the patient's acute symptoms suggest that the primary diagnosis should be alcohol withdrawal with perceptual disturbance (F10.232), while the secondary diagnosis will be alcohol use disorder (F10.20). 

I need to confirm the ICD-10 codes for the complete list, which includes:

1. Alcohol withdrawal with perceptual disturbance, F10.232
2. Alcohol use disorder, F10.20
3. Sedative/hypnotic/anxiolytic use disorder (benzodiazepine), F13.20
4. Stimulant use disorder, F15.10
5. Opioid use disorder, F11.10

This should ensure clarity while aligning with diagnostic criteria.

**Deciding on substance use diagnoses**

I’m considering how to label the conditions, weighing between “use disorder” and “abuse.” For sedative use, I need to determine whether to code it as moderate/severe or mild. Given long-term use, I might go for moderate severity. For stimulant and opioid use, I tend to lean towards mild codes but repeated positive tests hint at more severe issues. However, to confirm stimulant use disorder, I need clear criteria; the evidence is suggestive but not definitive.

Ultimately, I’ll ensure that the top five diagnoses are valid with correct ICD-10 codes, focusing on non-duplication while capturing the most likely conditions, including alcohol withdrawal with perceptual disturbance.

**Providing structured diagnoses**

The user wants a structured list of diagnoses with F-codes, without additional commentary or disclaimers. I’ll focus on the top five diagnoses based on the information available:

1. Alcohol withdrawal, with perceptual disturbance - F10.232  
2. Alcohol use disorder - F10.20  
3. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder - F13.20  
4. Stimulant (amphetamine-type) use disorder - F15.10

1007,"Collin is a 71 year old man, with remote history of alcohol use disorder, but has been sober for about 6 years. He used alcohol heavily from about 28 years of age to 65 years of age, acknowledging multiple inpatient medical hospitalizations for acute alcohol withdrawal as well as medical complications due to alcohol use, including acute liver failure and subsequent permanent gait abnormalities. He has come to his PCP with his wife reporting, “my family thinks I’m changing.” The wife interrupts the patient and states “you are changing, Collin.” The wife discloses that the patient wandered out of the house into the cold 3 times over the past month, and in the middle of the night. The wife states “I found him outside at about 2 a.m., it was 4 degrees outside and he was in his boxers, just standing there.” The patient himself recalls his wife bringing him inside, but can’t recall going outside. A recent CT scan in the local emergency room indicated no acute abnormalities or indication of stroke. The wife goes on to say, “Collin used to love cooking for the family, but now he can’t find his way around the kitchen”, stating the patient forgets to turn the burners off on the stove and even causes a fire in the kitchen a couple of months ago. The wife reports the family started noticing these changes about 2 years ago. There is no family history of dementia, Parkinson’s or Huntington’s disease. There are no known falls. Collin ultimately discloses “I do feel depressed these days”, reporting a worsening of sad and depressed mood starting about 2 years ago. He endorsed low motivation, anhedonia, and has even had passive suicidal thoughts over the past month. He denied any recent stressors, and denied returning to drinking alcohol or any drug use. Collin’s wife states, “he gets angry of the smallest things.” She goes on to say, “I have to help him get to the bathroom because he is incontinent in the bed very night now”, stating she also has to bath the patient because he can’t find his way around the bathroom. Finally, Collin’s wife states “he goes around making things up when we get around family, sometimes just inventing stuff on the whim, like saying he is making additions to the house or buying a new car, when that is both not true and has nothing to do with the conversation.",Alcohol induced Korsakov’s Syndrome (F10.26); Persistent depressive disorder (F34.1),,judah_weathers,,,,"**Evaluating depressive symptoms**

I'm considering the symptoms provided: depressed mood, anhedonia, low motivation, and suicidal ideation. While ""low motivation"" isn't one of the DSM MDD criteria, it might relate to decreased interest or energy, which is tricky. Anhedonia might cover it, but I'm unsure if we can assume that. I could diagnose ""Depressive disorder due to another medical condition"" if there's evidence the mood disturbance connects to a medical condition. However, I’m not certain there's enough evidence for causation here.

**Evaluating depressive diagnoses**

I'm considering potential diagnoses for the symptoms presented. ""Major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate"" could work, but there are gaps in the criteria. I might lean toward ""Other specified depressive disorder"" or ""Depressive disorder due to Alzheimer's."" It’s important to use DSM-5-TR diagnoses with ICD-10 codes.

There's a history of depressed mood and anhedonia for about two years, but I need at least two more symptoms to confirm. I could end up coding it as ""Depressive disorder, unspecified"" if I can’t clarify the specifics.

**Classifying depressive disorders**

I need to clarify the ICD-10 code for unspecified depressive disorder, which is F32.9, indicating ""Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified."" But the DSM-5-TR has the code F32.A for ""Unspecified depressive disorder,"" and I'm wondering if this format is acceptable since they requested F codes.

Considering the user’s behavior, such as anger and confusion, I might diagnose it as ""Major neurocognitive disorder with behavioral disturbance."" There are signs of significant interference with independence, which suggests it's major. The cause might involve multiple factors like Alzheimer's and alcohol use.

**Determining neurocognitive diagnoses**

I think I need to prioritize the diagnoses. ""Major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease"" feels like the primary option, while I could consider ""Alcohol-induced major neurocognitive disorder"" as a differential. I want to include both of those, plus ""Alcohol use disorder, severe, in sustained remission"" as another possible diagnosis.

I might also consider ""Neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury,"" but that's not provided. The confabulation details about making up stories could suggest memory deficits, and it might connect to psychosis related to dementia. I don’t think this would classify as a delusional disorder.

**Narrowing down neurocognitive disorders**

I'm processing the various symptoms and conditions to determine the most relevant diagnoses. It seems that ""Major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease"" is the primary candidate, but I also need to consider ""Alcohol-induced major neurocognitive disorder,"" particularly with confabulation noted. There could be impacts from alcohol use disorder as well.

Given the confusion and wandering at night, those behaviors suggest cognitive decline. I need to select five likely diagnoses while ensuring accuracy, like assessing for vascular contributions or frontotemporal degeneration. I'll structure the top diagnoses along the lines I mentioned.

**Analyzing Collin's condition**

Let's break down Collin's case. He's a 71-year-old man with a history of heavy alcohol use, now sober for six years. Recently, he’s shown concerning behaviors like wandering out at night and struggling in the kitchen. He has cognitive issues, including confusion and possible confabulation, but not the severe memory gaps typically seen in Korsakoff syndrome. 

Considering all the symptoms, Alzheimer's disease seems likely, but I have to explore other diagnoses like alcohol-related neurocognitive disorder. I need to clarify proper ICD-10 codes for these conditions and prepare a structured list of potential diagnoses along with their codes.

**Selecting diagnostic codes**

I need to find the correct codes for major neurocognitive disorders, particularly regarding Lewy body disease and alcohol-induced disorders. For Lewy bodies, I can use F02.81, but I should avoid duplicates. 

For alcohol-related disorders, F10.21 fits for someone in remission, but F10.96 and F10.97 also come up. It’s tricky because I need to ensure I’m using the right codes while adhering to the DSM-5-TR standards. I’ll outline the top five likely diagnoses and their corresponding F-codes, particularly focusing on potential Alzheimer’s and depressive disorders.

**Determining psychiatric diagnoses**

I need to select the right DSM-5-TR codes for the diagnoses related to neurocognitive disorders. For Alzheimer’s, I can use F02.81, emphasizing behavioral disturbance. Next, I'll include a depressive disorder, likely F06.31 or F06.32. 

Another important code is for alcohol use disorder in remission, which would be F10.21. I also need to consider major neurocognitive disorder due to vascular disease, possibly F01.51. The goal is to ensure that each diagnosis and code corresponds correctly while focusing on plausible differentials.

**Finalizing neurocognitive disorder diagnoses**

For alcohol-induced major neurocognitive disorder, I can consider F10.27 or F10.96. It looks like I need five diagnoses, already having primary NCD, depression, and alcohol use disorder in remission, plus vascular dementia. 

Maybe I could add ""Major neurocognitive disorder due to alcohol"" or ""multiple etiologies"" as the fifth. I’ll go with ""Major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease"" as primary using F00.11, which captures late onset with behavioral disturbance. Then I’ll include F06.31 for depression due to another medical condition and F10.21 for alcohol use disorder in remission.

**Selecting neurocognitive disorder diagnoses**

I'm contemplating the diagnostics for major neurocognitive disorders. I think I might still use F10.21 for alcohol use disorder and note that for substance-induced major NCD, you typically code both, but I want to include AUD in remission anyway.

So, for the fifth diagnosis, I could potentially use ""Major neurocognitive disorder due to vascular disease"" or ""alcohol-induced major NCD."" I’m leaning towards vascular dementia since he displays confusion and some visual-spatial challenges. 

The proposed list includes F00.11 for Alzheimer's, F06.31 for depressive disorder, and F10.27 for alcohol-induced NCD, making it five diagnoses.

**Finalizing mental health diagnoses**

I’m considering the best diagnoses for this case. I could list ""Major depressive disorder, unspecified"" to reflect depressive symptoms. Additionally, I want to include ""Alcohol use disorder in sustained remission"" and ""Major neurocognitive disorder due to alcohol"" as crucial considerations.

I also think vascular dementia might fit, especially with changes noted over the past two years. 

So my final list includes: major NCD due to Alzheimer's, unspecified depressive disorder, alcohol use disorder, alcohol-induced NCD, and vascular disease-related NCD. I need to confirm the codes for these diagnoses.

**Verifying diagnosis codes**

I need to confirm the accuracy of the ICD-10 codes for various diagnoses related to neurocognitive disorders. F00.11 is the code for ""Dementia in Alzheimer's disease with late onset, with behavioral disturbance,"" and it seems to be correct based on my checks. 

For alcohol-related conditions, I’m considering using F10.27 for alcohol-induced major neurocognitive disorder, and F10.21 for alcohol use disorder in sustained remission. 

I'm finalizing these codes for clarity in the diagnosis list.

**Finalizing diagnosis codes**

I’m considering the specifics of the F-codes, particularly F10.28, which relates to alcohol-induced persisting amnestic disorder and aligns with Korsakoff syndrome. It's valid to include as a differential diagnosis, even if the patient is in remission. 

I’ll also confirm that F32.A for unspecified depressive disorder is indeed an ICD-10 code. My final list of diagnoses includes primary and secondary options, formatted as requested, ensuring clarity without extra commentary.","1.

I need to pick among some potential disorders related to robust alcohol use. I’m thinking of including Alcohol Use Disorder, Alcohol-Induced Psychotic Disorder, Bipolar I Disorder, and PTSD, so that's four. I wonder if Major Depressive Disorder fits too, but the history of mania indicates bipolar. If mania could be substance-induced or misinterpreted, could I consider ""Unspecified Depressive Disorder""? Alternatively, there's ""Alcohol Withdrawal with Perceptual Disturbances,"" but that overlaps with alcohol-induced psychotic disorder. However, they are distinct in the DSM.

**Selecting top diagnoses**

I need to narrow it down to the top five diagnoses. I’m considering starting with Alcohol-Induced Psychotic Disorder as primary, followed by Alcohol Use Disorder as secondary. Alcohol Withdrawal with Perceptual Disturbances is another option, but since I have the alcohol-induced condition, it might not be necessary. Bipolar I Disorder and PTSD are also strong candidates. I’m debating whether to include Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective Disorder, or possibly something like Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum due to a lack of enough specifics.

**Evaluating psychotic disorders and symptoms**

The user has auditory hallucinations and thought insertion along with delusions for at least two weeks. Unfortunately, this doesn't meet the criteria for schizophrenia or schizophreniform, since those require longer durations. Brief Psychotic Disorder could be a possibility, given the stress of moving, but her alcohol use complicates things. Delusional Disorder is unlikely since there are also hallucinations. Unspecified Psychotic Disorder could be considered, though it's attributed to alcohol. I should also weigh the possibility of Bipolar I due to her mania history and examine her depressive symptoms, potentially linking them to Alcohol-Induced Depressive Disorder.

**Compiling psychiatric diagnoses**

I need to narrow down to the top five likely psychiatric diagnoses and make sure I include the corresponding ICD-10 F-codes. It’s okay if some are provisional. I’ll confirm the F-codes for Alcohol Use Disorder, which should be F10.20 for severe alcohol dependence. For Alcohol Withdrawal, it looks like F10.23 is appropriate for alcohol dependence with withdrawal. I should also consider listing an ""Other Specified Depressive Disorder"" if needed, but I’ll focus on getting the main five down accurately.

**Analyzing potential diagnoses**

I’m considering the diagnosis of schizophrenia, but without chronicity, it seems less likely. Brief Psychotic Disorder could be an option, but the patient has significant PTSD symptoms that may lead to misinterpretation of hallucinations. We also see a clear history of mania, suggesting Bipolar I Disorder. Alcohol Use Disorder could also contribute to depressive symptoms and psychosis. Given this complexity, I'll compile a differential list focusing on the top five diagnoses, including Alcohol-Induced Psychotic Disorder, Alcohol Use Disorder, and Bipolar I Disorder with psychotic features.

**Finalizing psychiatric diagnoses**

I’m looking to finalize the structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses. First, we'll place Alcohol-Induced Psychotic Disorder as the primary due to the presence of hallucinations. For the secondary diagnoses, I’ll include Alcohol Use Disorder, severe, and Bipolar I Disorder, current episode depressed with psychotic features. PTSD will also be part of the list. For the fifth diagnosis, it seems appropriate to consider either Alcohol Withdrawal with Perceptual Disturbances or Schizoaffective Disorder, bipolar type, based on the information provided. This will give us the most plausible picture of the case.

**Deciding on primary diagnosis**

I’m trying to determine the primary diagnosis here, weighing the details about the psychotic symptoms. They started two weeks ago, coinciding with the patient's cutback in alcohol. This might suggest withdrawal rather than intoxication, although 2 weeks is a considerable timeframe. There’s a possibility of Alcohol-induced Psychotic Disorder given the heavy drinking history and symptoms. I'm contemplating whether to classify Alcohol Use Disorder as primary, given its chronicity and complications. 

The structured list will need to clearly reflect these conditions and their corresponding F-codes.

**Evaluating diagnoses for psychosis**

I'm considering the structure of the diagnoses for this case. Since the patient has hallucinations, F10.251 seems more precise. The presence of both hallucinations and delusions allows me to specify the predominant symptom. Given her background—heavy alcohol use and symptoms that could be mistaken for mania—I'm leaning towards listing ""Alcohol-induced psychotic disorder, with hallucinations"" as primary. The history of mania suggests potential bipolar disorder, so including that makes sense too. There's a lot to weigh here, but I’ll settle on the top five diagnoses based on the criteria established.

**Determining primary diagnoses for psychosis**

I'm evaluating the patient’s situation and trying to find the best way to categorize their diagnoses. It seems that their alcohol use disorder is very prominent, but given the hallucinations, I might consider ""Alcohol-induced psychotic disorder"" as a primary diagnosis. There's also a potential bipolar disorder and PTSD listed. The priority here is determining whether the psychosis is from substance use or a primary psychotic disorder. Based on the details, I’m leaning towards listing ""Alcohol use disorder, severe"" as my primary focus, supported by the evidence of heavy drinking and withdrawal symptoms.

**Finalizing the diagnosis list**

I’m figuring out the best way to list the diagnoses for this case. The prompt emphasizes using structured F-codes. I considered ""Alcohol-induced psychotic disorder with hallucinations"" as primary (F10.251) and ""Alcohol use disorder, severe"" (F10.20) as secondary. Bipolar I disorder and PTSD also factor in. I could choose ""Unspecified psychotic disorder"" (F29), but it might be redundant with the previous psychotic disorder. The key is confirming that we have the most accurate and relevant codes without unnecessary overlaps. I’m settling on a clear list of five diagnoses.

**Deciding the diagnosis list**

I’m assessing the different diagnosis options here, especially for ""Alcohol-induced psychotic disorder."" I'm considering if I should include ""Bipolar I disorder"" (F31.9) since the patient has a history of mania. Then there's PTSD (F43.10) and potentially unspecified psychotic disorder (F29), but that might be redundant. I’m checking on ""Alcohol-induced depressive disorder"" too. Ultimately, I’m looking to finalize a concise list of five diagnoses, considering how they all interact and could coexist. My current lineup might include major depressive disorder as a differential too.

**Finalizing the diagnosis list**

I’m balancing a few considerations for the diagnosis list based on the vignette. It suggests mania, so I’m leaning towards ""Bipolar I disorder"" as a suitable diagnosis. I also want to include ""Alcohol-induced psychotic disorder"" because of the psychosis associated with alcohol use. PTSD fits as well, along with ""Alcohol Use Disorder, severe."" For the fifth diagnosis, I’m debating between ""Alcohol withdrawal"" symptoms or maybe ""Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder."" Ultimately, I'm focusing on getting those codes right before finalizing it!

**Finalizing the diagnosis list**

I’m considering the best codes and diagnoses based on the information. For the primary diagnosis, “Alcohol-Induced Psychotic Disorder, with hallucinations” seems solid (F10.251). Next, I want to include “Alcohol Use Disorder, severe” (F10.20) and “Bipolar I Disorder” (F31.9). I will also add “Posttraumatic Stress Disorder” (F43.10) and “Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder” (F29). I feel this list reflects the likely diagnoses without unnecessary details. Here’s the structured list!

**Structuring the final diagnoses**

I’m organizing the ICD-10-CM codes for the diagnoses. For the primary diagnosis, I’ll list “Alcohol-Induced Psychotic Disorder, with hallucinations” (F10.251). Next is “Alcohol Use Disorder, severe” (F10.20), followed by “Bipolar I Disorder” (F31.9). Then, I’ll include “Posttraumatic Stress Disorder” (F43.10) and finally “Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder” (F29).

Erin reports that she has had no problems with depressed, sad or hopeless mood symptoms, and denied problems with excessive worry or panic. She lives at home with her two mothers, older brother and their dog Fiji. The patient does report that she goes to the gym for about 3 hours each day of the week, during which she does about 2.5 hours of cardiovascular training. She states she skip lunch on most days, has a sliced apple for breakfast, and take her dinner to her bedroom to slowly eat the vegetable portion of dinner (only) over a period of about 3 hours. Menarche was at age 13.5, but she has missed 3 of her last periods. She reports a lot of gastric reflex, and its wakes her up at night time. She also reports “I don’t really have bowel movements anymore, so I take a laxative in the morning and at night time.” She aims to eat less than 1000 calories in a day.","Anorexia nervosa, restrictive type (F50.01)",,judah_weathers,,,,"**Considering ICD-10 Codes**

Okay, so they specifically asked for ICD-10 F-codes, not CM, so I’ll start with F50.8 for “Other specified feeding or eating disorder (atypical anorexia nervosa).” I wonder if I also need to list F50.9 for unspecified feeding or eating disorder. I should aim for four distinct secondary diagnoses without duplicates. 

I’m considering including ""Obsessive-compulsive disorder,"" but there are no clear obsessions outside of eating. Let's evaluate options based on the information provided!

**Reviewing Eating Disorder Diagnoses**

I'm considering including ""Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID)"" with the code F50.82. However, ARFID usually involves restrictions leading to weight loss and not just body image issues. There’s still the possibility of anorexia since the user's exercise levels hint at weight concerns, but it's not entirely explicit. I should add ARFID as a secondary diagnosis. 

I’m also mulling over diagnoses like ""Somatic symptom disorder"" (F45.1) and ""Illness anxiety disorder"" (F45.21), but those don't seem to fit. I'm thinking the top five diagnoses will likely focus on eating disorders, including ""Anorexia nervosa"" and ""Other specified feeding or eating disorder."" I should ensure I’m meeting the user's request for a structured list that may also include relevant comorbidities.

**Evaluating Likely Diagnoses**

The user specifically asked for a list of the top five most likely diagnoses along with corresponding ICD-10 F-codes, including one primary diagnosis and four secondary ones. I see that secondary diagnoses can be plausible alternatives rather than strict comorbidities. 

For the primary diagnosis, I’m leaning towards anorexia nervosa. But which type? There's evidence of laxative use, which could suggest the binge-eating/purging type. Since she also has constipation, it’s a bit tricky, but given the circumstances, I might choose binge-eating/purging type due to laxative use while considering the restricting type as a secondary option. I’ll strive to clarify that they can’t both be separate diagnoses since they’re specifiers.

**Deciding on Differential Diagnoses**

I'm thinking about the differential diagnoses and realizing I could list alternative options. The user wants definitive diagnoses, so it might be better to choose one primary diagnosis and perhaps include ""Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder"" (OSFED) later. 

Looking at the clinical features, she consumes less than 1,000 calories a day, engages in intense exercise for three hours, skips meals, and restricts her diet significantly. She’s missed three periods, indicating potential malnutrition. While I don’t have her weight, her symptoms suggest she’s likely at a low weight, which aligns with anorexia, though it’s possible she could be at a normal weight initially.

**Determining Top Diagnoses**

I’m considering that due to age and amenorrhea, the ""Female Athlete Triad"" could apply, but it doesn’t fit the ICD-10 F-code. The relevant focus here is on eating disorders; the most likely primary diagnosis is anorexia nervosa. 

For the secondary diagnoses, I’m thinking of possible options like OSFED (Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder), ARFID, and unspecified feeding or eating disorder. The symptoms point towards a restrictive eating pattern. Considering the lack of clear body image issues and missing weight information, I can still identify five plausible diagnoses, ensuring one is primary while the others provide alternatives.

**Finalizing Diagnoses List**

I'm analyzing the case to identify the top five most likely psychiatric diagnoses, focusing on eating disorders. Purging disorder might fit, but the motivation isn’t clear. ARFID seems relevant due to restriction, but I need a solid primary diagnosis considering the provided information. ""Unspecified Feeding or Eating Disorder"" could work well because of the evidence of disordered eating but insufficient weight info.

For the structured list, I’ll include:
1. Anorexia nervosa, binge-eating/purging type - F50.02
2. Anorexia nervosa, restricting type - F50.01
3. Other specified feeding or eating disorder (purging disorder) - F50.89
4. Other specified feeding or eating disorder (atypical anorexia) - F50.89
5. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder - F50.82

Each option reflects the clinical details without excess duplications.

**Providing Diagnosis List**

I need to finalize the list of the top five likely psychiatric diagnoses based on the provided case. The strong evidence suggests anorexia nervosa due to severe restriction, excessive exercise, amenorrhea, and laxative use. As for the primary diagnosis, I’ll go with ""Anorexia nervosa, binge-eating/purging type"" (F50.02). 

The secondary diagnoses are:
1. Anorexia nervosa, restricting type - F50.01
2. Other specified feeding or eating disorder (purging disorder) - F50.89
3. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder - F50.82
4. Eating disorder, unspecified - F50.9

This covers the most likely options while adhering to the criteria needed!

**Finalizing Diagnosis Codes**

I have to ensure that the diagnoses I provide are in DSM-5-TR terms, like using ""Other specified feeding or eating disorder"" (OSFED) or ""Unspecified feeding or eating disorder"" (UFED) appropriately. For the top five diagnoses, I believe I can list both OSFED variants since they share the same ICD-10 code.

So, I'll include: 
1. Anorexia nervosa, binge-eating/purging type - F50.02
2. Anorexia nervosa, restricting type - F50.01
3. Other specified feeding or eating disorder (atypical anorexia nervosa) - F50.89
4. Other specified feeding or eating disorder (purging disorder) - F50.89
5. Unspecified feeding or eating disorder - F50.9

**Determining Unique Diagnoses**

I need to clarify the diagnoses without duplicating codes. It seems fine to list ""Other specified feeding or eating disorder"" with a unique code while keeping ""Unspecified feeding or eating disorder"" as another. Since there’s ambiguity around ARFID and atypical anorexia, I find that including them both might not provide the needed clarity. 

So, I think I'll settle on these final five diagnoses:
1. Anorexia nervosa, binge-eating/purging type - F50.02
2. Anorexia nervosa, restricting type - F50.01
3. Other specified feeding or eating disorder - F50.89
4. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder - F50.82
5. Unspecified feeding or eating disorder - F50.9

This includes unique codes while covering nuances.

**Evaluating Diagnostic Options**

I'm considering the impairment indicators in this case, like amenorrhea and gastrointestinal issues. Even though mood symptoms are denied, I still think evidence exists for a diagnosis, especially considering her restrictive behavior and caloric intake. 

I might lean toward diagnosing ""Anorexia nervosa, binge-eating/purging type"" as primary due to laxative use. The possible diagnoses could include:

1. Anorexia nervosa, binge-eating/purging type - F50.02
2. Anorexia nervosa, restricting type - F50.01
3. Other specified feeding or eating disorder - F50.89
4. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder - F50.82
5. Unspecified feeding or eating disorder - F50.9 

Yet I still must ensure no duplicates, as they'd prefer unique conditions.

**Finalizing Diagnostic List**

I'm putting together the top 5 most likely diagnoses based on the details provided. My primary choice is ""Anorexia nervosa, binge-eating/purging type"" due to the use of laxatives, while the others include:

1. Anorexia nervosa, binge-eating/purging type - F50.02  
2. Anorexia nervosa, restricting type - F50.01  
3. Other specified feeding or eating disorder (atypical anorexia nervosa) - F50.89  
4. Other specified feeding or eating disorder (purging disorder) - F50.89  
5. Unspecified feeding or eating disorder - F50.9  

This fits the criteria while keeping it clear and structured!","1. Anorexia nervosa, binge-eating/purging type - F50.02

1010,"Amber is a 37 year old woman, that comes to the emergency room with a chief complaint of “I just want to die.” Amber is well known to this emergency room, sometimes coming to the emergency room with suicidal thinking and plans more than 10 times a week. She has been hospitalized over 40 times in the past 5 years. She has a long history of cutting behaviors, which is currently active, and started around 13 years of age. She reports extensive trauma history, including surviving sexual abuse as a adolescent at home, but then also surviving intimate partner violence in subsequent relationships in her adult hood. She reports “constant” flashbacks, nightmares, and hypervigilance, and now avoids any places where “Im the only woman in the room.” The patient reports her current suicidal thoughts and plan to overdose on all of her medications at home is due to “my girlfriend broke up with me out of the blue; she said I’m too much to handle.” The patient reports present mood of “pissed off”, but denied any recent problems or changes in appetite, energy, motivation or enjoying activities she typically enjoys. Denied recent or past mania or psychosis, and she denied problems with heavy alcohol use or street drug use. She acknowledges that “none of my family talk to me anymore; I only had my girlfriend for support.",Borderline personality disorder (F60.3); Post traumatic stress disorder (F43.1),,judah_weathers,,,,"**Verifying ICD-10 Codes**

Yes, ICD-10-CM added F32.A for ""Depression, unspecified"" to differentiate from Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), while some payers still use F32.9. I'm curious if DSM-5-TR will also adopt F32.A for ""Unspecified depressive disorder."" Based on my findings, it looks like F32.A is used for unspecified depressive disorder in DSM-5-TR, replacing F32.9. However, the user specifically asked for ICD-10 F-codes, which complicates things since F32.A belongs to ICD-10-CM, not the typical ICD-10.

**Choosing the Right Codes**

They might prefer codes like F32.9, but they mentioned ""ICD-10 F-codes,"" which brings some clarity. F32.9 is indeed an ICD-10 code for ""depressive episode unspecified,"" which fits. In the DSM-5, they use ICD-10-CM, but I want to avoid confusion by sticking with codes like F32.9 for unspecified depressive disorder. For personality disorders, I consider F60.89 or F60.9, but F60.7 might also be relevant based on her reliance on others and potential BPD-related issues. There’s clearly a complex relationship dynamic at play.

**Considering Diagnostic Options**

I’m contemplating whether to categorize this as dependency or consider ""Other specified dissociative disorder"" F44.89 because of the ""constant flashbacks."" Flashbacks in PTSD can also lead to dissociative reactions, but I’m not sure it’s enough to warrant a separate diagnosis. There’s also the option for ""Unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder"" F43.9, especially if I'm unsure about PTSD. Without explicit negative mood or cognition criteria, we can't confirm a full PTSD diagnosis, despite symptoms like intrusive thoughts and hypervigilance. It's a tricky situation!

**Evaluating PTSD Diagnosis**

We might still consider diagnosing PTSD based on the presence of ""constant flashbacks, nightmares, hypervigilance, and avoidance,"" especially with trauma exposure. There are indications of negative cognition or mood, suggested by social isolation and negative beliefs about safety. She shows some detachment and persistent negative emotions like anger, even if they aren’t explicitly stated. Given her symptoms, I wonder if it’s more appropriate to label it as “Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder,” though the core PTSD characteristics are clearly present. I think PTSD is strongly indicated in this case.

**Identifying Possible Diagnoses**

I'm thinking about potential diagnoses here. We might consider ""Borderline personality disorder"" alongside ""Posttraumatic stress disorder,"" but I'm also exploring options like ""Other specified personality disorder."" The instructions ask for the top five likely diagnoses, which will include primary and secondary ones. 

Given the symptoms and challenges, my finalized list might include: 1) Borderline personality disorder (F60.3), 2) Posttraumatic stress disorder (F43.10), 3) Other specified depressive disorder (F32.8), 4) Adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct (F43.25), and 5) Unspecified anxiety disorder (F41.9). This approach appears to balance support with possible conditions!

**Evaluating Diagnostic Options**

I'm considering including ""Unspecified personality disorder"" (F60.9) as a secondary diagnosis, but it seems redundant. I think the most fitting primary diagnosis would be ""Borderline personality disorder"" (BPD), supported by continual trauma symptoms and suicidality linked to a breakup. 

For the top five, I can list: 1) Borderline personality disorder (F60.3), 2) Posttraumatic stress disorder (F43.10), 3) Adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct (F43.25), 4) Unspecified depressive disorder (F32.9), and 5) Unspecified anxiety disorder (F41.9). I see the need for some differentiation while remaining precise here!

**Determining Likely Diagnoses**

I'm settling on using specific codes for diagnoses. For **Borderline Personality Disorder**, I'll use F60.3 and for **Posttraumatic Stress Disorder**, I'll go with F43.10.

Next, I’ll include **Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Disturbance of Emotions and Conduct** (F43.25), **Unspecified Depressive Disorder** (F32.9), and **Unspecified Anxiety Disorder** (F41.9). 

While I'm considering alternatives, it seems clear that the primary diagnosis should be **Borderline Personality Disorder**, due to the frequency of suicidal behavior and self-harm.

**Listing Potential Diagnoses**

I'm considering the best diagnoses for the case. Given the situation, I’ll include **Borderline Personality Disorder (F60.3)** and **Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (F43.10)** as primary. Then, I'll add **Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Disturbance of Emotions and Conduct (F43.25)**, **Unspecified Depressive Disorder (F32.9)**, and **Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9)**. 

While evaluating, I think the patient's acute suicidal plan due to a breakup suggests these conditions fit well, focusing on the most relevant diagnoses.

**Evaluating Diagnoses**

I'm sorting through possible diagnoses for the case. Adjustment disorder might fit due to emotional responses and suicidality, but given the chronic patterns and the presence of BPD, it might not be appropriate. I might lean towards **Borderline Personality Disorder (F60.3)** as primary and **Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (F43.10)** as secondary. I could also consider **Major Depressive Disorder (F33.2)** and **Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9)**. Still, I need to limit my list to the top five plausible conditions.

**Listing Potential Diagnoses**

I’m assessing the diagnoses here, starting with Borderline Personality Disorder (F60.3) and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (F43.10) as primary considerations. As for the remaining conditions, I might include Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Disturbance of Emotions and Conduct (F43.25), alongside Unspecified Depressive Disorder (F32.9) and possibly Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9). Each diagnosis should reflect the severity and nuances of the symptoms presented. I need to ensure a clear structure with the diagnoses numbered and formatted correctly for the user.

**Finalizing F-code Selection**

They've requested F-codes, and I’m deciding between F43.10 and F43.1 for PTSD. I believe using F43.10, which is the ICD-10-CM code, is appropriate since it's more specific. For the other conditions like adjustment disorder, I'll use F43.25; for unspecified depressive disorder, F32.9, and for unspecified anxiety disorder, F41.9. It’s important I deliver solely the diagnoses without any reasoning or added details, formatted correctly as ""<diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code."" Let’s finalize that!","1.

1011,"Evan is a 62 year old white man, a Harvard Professor in Economics, with a multi-decade history of heavy alcohol use, but recently sober for approximately 7 months after completing substance rehabilitation in an outpatient settings. Evan presented to the emergency room after taking approximately ten 1 mg Klonopin in one setting, he states was “because I was tired and really wanted to go to sleep.” The patient indicates “I was not trying to kill myself” and “I regret taking that number of tablets at once.” He acknowledges recent discord with his wife, stating “I feel very afraid that she is going to leave me whenever we get into arguments, also indicating that after their most recent argument 2 days prior, he relapsed with alcohol use and drank about 6 standard drinks each of the last 2 days, and was intoxicated at the time of overdose. Patient reports “I used to be so active in teaching at Harvard. Now, I feel like I don’t have purpose”, stating that his department at Harvard has been assigning him less teaching or supervising obligations. The patient denied problems with active thoughts, plans or intents of harm to self or others. He denied recent or past symptoms of mania or psychosis. The patient acknowledged recent increased need for sleep, up to 14 hours a day, and still feeling tired when awake. He has had a approximately 10 pound unintentional weight loss over the past month. He acknowledges that there has been a significant increase in difficulty concentrating on texts he used to be able to attend to without issue. He states “sometimes it feels like I’m walking through mud throughout the day”, and “I want to get back to enjoying things in life again.” He acknowledges “sometimes I find myself just crying, but I have no idea why.” He denied feelings of hopelessness or despair. He denied trauma history, nor symptoms of OCD or panic.

The patient denied headache or vision changes in the emergency room. The emergency room clinician completed paperwork for the patient to be admitted on an involuntary basis to inpatient psychiatry. The following day, a repeat head CT revealed the subdural hematoma appeared 5-7 mm in length, yet the patient continued to deny vision changes, headache, confusion or extremity weakness.

I need to double-check the diagnostic codes. I think for ICD-10, we have F13.2x for dependence, F13.1x for abuse, and F13.9x for unspecified use. We also have additional digits for intoxication and withdrawal, which needs consideration. 

The DSM-5 gives guidance on using codes according to substance class and any co-occurring disorders. But for my output, I should focus on the top five diagnoses with their respective codes, including both substance use disorder and intoxication.

**Identifying potential diagnoses**

I need to consider adding ""Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication"" and ""Alcohol intoxication"" to the list. Other options could be ""Other specified anxiety disorder,"" or ""Adjustment disorder with depressed mood,"" but I must have enough evidence for each diagnosis.

The case shows signs of marital discord and feelings of purposelessness, which might fit adjustment disorder, but major depressive disorder already covers some areas. However, since I'm asked to provide the top five diagnoses, including plausible conditions each considered sounds fair, even though we need to rule out some.

**Determining diagnoses options**

I might consider adding ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" with separation anxiety features, and possibly ""Dependent personality disorder"" due to the client's fear of abandonment. ""Alcohol-induced depressive disorder"" is another option, especially given his heavy alcohol use and recent relapse, which could suggest substance-induced depression.

However, he has a long history of depression. For the top five diagnoses, I'm thinking:

1. Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode, moderate - F33.1
2. Alcohol use disorder, severe - F10.20
3. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication (clonazepam overdose) - F13.929 or F13.129 (need to clarify)
4. Alcohol intoxication, uncomplicated - F10.129
5. Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood - F43.23 or with depressed mood - F43.21 or with anxiety - F43.22. 

Maybe I should include ""Other specified personality disorder (borderline traits)"" as well, with code F60.89, but I'm unsure if adjustment disorder fits considering MDD.

**Choosing diagnoses for listing**

I’m considering various diagnoses to include. ""Suicidal behavior disorder"" seems relevant, but I can't assign an F code, so that's out. I could think about ""Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, mild,"" but not really. There’s also the potential for ""Other specified insomnia disorder,"" but he actually has hypersomnia.

Instead, I could go with ""Hypersomnolence disorder"" (F51.11), even if it might stem from depression. For my structured list, I need to finalize these top five diagnoses:

1. Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode, moderate (F33.1).
2. Alcohol use disorder, severe (F10.20).
3. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication (clonazepam) - I need to choose the right code here.
4. Alcohol intoxication - again, I’ll specify the appropriate code. 

The challenge is getting the best fits!

**Finalizing diagnostic codes**

Considering he fears separation from his wife, I might include ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" (F41.8) or ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" (F41.9), but I'm not sure if those fit well. There’s also the option of including “Alcohol-induced anxiety disorder,” but that's not appropriate. 

I think the best five diagnoses I can finalize include:

1. Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode, moderate - F33.1.
2. Alcohol use disorder, severe - F10.20.
3. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication (clonazepam) - likely F13.920.
4. Alcohol intoxication - potentially F10.129.
5. I need to confirm these codes and ensure clarity on their interactions and distinctions. It's a complex process navigating these diagnoses!

**Choosing diagnostic codes**

I’m analyzing the potential diagnoses here. I might include ""Alcohol-induced mood disorder"" (F10.94), but let’s consider other options as well. Given the heavy alcohol use and recent relapse, it feels appropriate to list ""Alcohol use disorder, severe"" (F10.20) alongside ""Major depressive disorder"" (F33.1).

As for benzodiazepine, it could be ""Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication"" (F13.920), but perhaps I’ll also include ""Alcohol intoxication, uncomplicated"" (F10.220). Lastly, I’m weighing in ""Adjustment disorder with depressed mood"" (F43.21) as a differential. This decision-making feels quite dense!

**Analyzing potential diagnoses**

I’m considering ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" (F41.9) since he fears abandonment, but it may not be strong enough. He has symptoms like heavy sleep, weight loss, and trouble concentrating, which points to Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).

On top of that, I’m weighing ""Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication"" for benzodiazepines and looking at his alcohol use disorder as well. While I could list other possibilities, I want a clear top five. It feels like it’s getting complex, but I want to keep it straightforward!

**Finalizing diagnosis codes**

I'm considering various diagnosis codes like ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" (F41.8) or unspecified anxiety disorder (F41.9). I’m also looking at ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety"" (F43.22), but since Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is present, I might opt for ""Alcohol-induced anxiety disorder"" or decide based on his severe alcohol use and clonazepam overdose.

Ultimately, I plan to list MDD as the primary diagnosis, along with alcohol use disorder and others like sedative intoxication. I need to ensure I detail it in the right format with no extra text, following the guidelines provided.

**Listing potential diagnoses**

I'm exploring various diagnoses that fit the user's situation. Given his chronic depression and anxiety about abandonment, I’m leaning toward major depressive disorder as primary. Alcohol use disorder seems severe given his history, and I’m considering including aspects like sedative intoxication from clonazepam. 

I want to keep the list concise, ensuring to follow guidelines that specify formatting without extra reasoning. The top five diagnoses might include MDD, alcohol use disorder, and different forms of intoxication or potential personality disorders. Let’s finalize with those!

**Determining primary diagnosis**

I’m considering the symptoms and criteria for various diagnoses here. He has a history of depression for over five years, making major depressive disorder a strong candidate. The symptoms suggest it could be recurrent, but without clear evidence, I might choose ""Major depressive disorder, recurrent, unspecified"" (F33.9) to capture the complexity. I’m also assessing other possible diagnoses like adjustment disorders and neurocognitive conditions, but these seem less likely given the information provided. Let’s finalize a clear list for the user!

**Clarifying diagnoses options**

I'm considering which diagnosis to assign based on the patient's history and symptoms. Major depressive disorder seems likely given his five-year treatment with Cymbalta, suggesting a recurrent episode is possible (F33.1). For alcohol use disorder, I'll list it as moderate to severe (F10.20). For intoxication, I can include both alcohol intoxication (F10.220) and sedative/hypnotic intoxication (F13.920). I need to finalize a fifth diagnosis; it may lean towards unspecified anxiety disorder or another possibility, relying on the information provided.

**Finalizing psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm considering including ""Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, unspecified"" but that doesn't seem right. I might stick to ""Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode"" (F33.1) because of his history. For alcohol use disorder, ""Alcohol use disorder, severe"" (F10.20) fits. Alcohol intoxication (F10.220) and sedative intoxication (F13.920) are also relevant. Finally, I can list ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" (F41.9). It feels like a solid approach, double-checking the ICD-10 codes to ensure everything aligns!

**Finalizing diagnoses and codes**

I need to be careful when including both alcohol use disorder and alcohol intoxication, since their codes might overlap, but that's okay. I considered ""Alcohol-induced depressive disorder,"" but I’m leaning against that. I want to confirm that the codes I provide, like F10.220 and F13.920, are indeed the correct ICD-10 F-codes. I’ll make sure to present the full codes, like ""F33.1,"" with the correct formatting. Let’s finalize this output!","1. Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode, moderate - F33.1

1012,"Melanie is an 11 year old girl who was brought to urgent care by her mother after being sent home from school for “using racial slurs.” Melanie is the product of a full-term, uncomplicated pregnancy, vaginally delivered with normal APGAR (Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration) score at birth. Melanie used her first word “Momma” around 48 months of age, and didn’t start noticing other children playing with her until about 6 years old. Even at 6 years old, Melanie would not respond to her name when called, often appearing like she was in a daydream, and would often do a lot of “rocking” or “spinning” when anxious. Melanie’s mother indicates “Melanie is a unique kid. She doesn’t really make good eye contact with me, her father or her friends, and seems to be overly focused on doing puzzles all day. She has a hard time making friends, because all she wants to do is work on puzzles, and does little interactive play with others.” Melanies mother also indicates “if we take her puzzle away from her for dinner, she will have a complete ‘meltdown’ and be inconsolable for a good hour, ultimately leading to us having to give her the puzzle back.” Around 8 years of age, Melanie was found blinking her eyes repeatedly, and would say “I have to do it” whenever family questioned the eye blinking. The eye blinking slowly went away, but seemed to be replace by Melanie contorting her neck repeatedly, and especially when getting ready for school or leaving the house. Now, Melanie slaps herself in the head repeatedly when stressed, to the point that family has to adorn Melanie with soft gloves so she does not cause injury. About 13 months ago, Melanie start screaming out racial slurs when in the grocery store and school, and this would last for about 5 minutes in duration, until she was able to calm down. Otherwise, Melanie denied problems with sad, depressed or hopeless mood, nor problems with auditory or visual hallucinations. Melanies mother denied observations of bizarre rituals such as excessive handwashing, counting or organizing, but does report Melanie has a strong and persistent interest in puzzles. Melanie denied active thoughts, plans or intents of harm to self or others.",Autistic Disorder (F 84.0); Tourette Syndrome (F95.2),"Medium given LLM would need to be able to know that Tourette syndrome (vs Tic disorder) can only be diagnosed with both motor AND vocal tics present for at least 12 month duration, which the patient has here.",judah_weathers,,,,"**Considering tics and stereotypies**

I’m thinking that if we consider both Tourette's and SMD, it might lead to counting the same movements twice. For instance, there could be both tics and stereotypies at play. Rocking and spinning fall into stereotypies, while blinking and neck contortions are tics. Self-slapping might be seen as either, making it tricky. In a vignette describing someone self-slapping when stressed, it sounds more like stereotypy, especially since it's rhythmic and tied to stress rather than sudden urges.

**Examining tic diagnoses**

I’m analyzing the case where the eye blinking went away and was replaced by neck contortions, followed by self-slapping when stressed. This suggests a sequence typical for tics, which can change over time, and self-slapping might even be considered a complex tic. However, tics usually come with an urge, as noted when eye blinking was described. I need to identify four secondary diagnoses, and besides Tourette's, I can consider ""Unspecified tic disorder"" or ""Stereotypic movement disorder."" I have to remember to stick to the DSM-5-TR guidelines for structure and clarity!

**Identifying possible diagnoses**

I need to provide the top five likely diagnoses with their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes. The primary diagnosis appears to be Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), possibly with language impairment but not intellectual impairment. Then, we can list Tourette's Disorder (F95.2) and Stereotypic Movement Disorder with self-injurious behavior (F98.4), though the latter might feel redundant. I'm also considering Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) (F42), but the mother's denial of rituals complicates that. Finally, Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder (F80.82) could be a possibility, but it can't co-occur with ASD. It might still be worth listing.

**Clarifying diagnosis criteria**

I’m realizing it's redundant to include Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder (SCD) if Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is present. While I might consider it a ""rule-out,"" the user specifically asked for diagnoses, not this kind of consideration. They want the top five most likely diagnoses, which should be plausible based on the information. I’ll also stick to only psychiatric conditions. I’m wondering if Selective Mutism or Intellectual Developmental Disorder could fit, but I’m not convinced there’s enough evidence for those. I need clear, distinct options!

**Formulating the diagnosis list**

The user is asking for a structured list of the top five diagnoses with corresponding ICD-10 F-codes, while emphasizing not to include reasoning. I’m considering Autism Spectrum Disorder (F84.0) as primary, followed by Tourette's Disorder (F95.2), and possibly Stereotypic Movement Disorder (F98.4). However, OCD and anxiety disorders might not fit given the information, and I should be cautious with other conditions like disruptive mood disorders. I’ll aim to include plausible, distinct options that align with the description provided!

**Determining possible diagnoses**

I'm considering possible diagnoses based on the information provided. First, I'd list Autism Spectrum Disorder (F84.0) and Tourette's Disorder (F95.2). Next, Stereotypic Movement Disorder with self-injurious behavior (F98.4) might fit due to the observed behaviors, but I’m unsure about separating it from tics. Language Disorder (F80.2) could be relevant given the history of language delay. Lastly, Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9) seems applicable since anxiety triggers various behaviors. This list balances what’s most plausible without fabricating symptoms!

**Assessing potential diagnoses**

I’m considering the diagnosis of Language Disorder (F80.2) based on the user's history of language delay. However, since we lack current evidence of persistent difficulties, I might opt for Unspecified Communication Disorder (F80.9) instead. It captures the history of language delay without over-diagnosing. While Autism Spectrum Disorder (F84.0) and Tourette’s Disorder (F95.2) seem clear, I want to include Stereotypic Movement Disorder (F98.4) based on self-injurious behavior, along with factors like anxiety that fit potential diagnoses. This way, I ensure I cover the most plausible options!

**Identifying appropriate diagnoses**

I think we should examine potential diagnoses. While Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) might not be applicable, I wonder if Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder or Adjustment Disorder could fit. There's a possibility of including Unspecified Anxiety Disorder since she appears anxious. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Tourette’s Disorder are solid choices, and Stereotypic Movement Disorder is a contender too. 

Given her significant language delay, maybe we can incorporate that as part of ASD. I’ll finalize five supported diagnoses: ASD, Tourette’s, Stereotypic Movement Disorder, Unspecified Anxiety Disorder, and potentially ADHD or a language-related disorder.

**Determining potential diagnoses**

I need to finalize the additional diagnoses for this case. We might include ""Tic Disorder"" and ""Stereotypic Movement Disorder."" I wonder if ""Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder"" is plausible due to some verbal outbursts, but they could also be explained by Tourette's.

Maybe ""Unspecified Anxiety Disorder"" fits since she appears anxious, and I think about including ""Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder"" as a potential secondary, though the evidence isn't strong. Ultimately, I'll compile the top diagnoses, carefully considering the most plausible options based on the details provided.

**Clarifying potential diagnoses**

I need to generate a list of the top five likely diagnoses with their ICD-10 F-codes. I have ""Tourette's disorder"" and ""Stereotypic movement disorder"" lined up. The challenge is determining whether ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" or ""Obsessive-compulsive disorder"" fits better, especially since both aren't directly described. 

Given the signs of early language delay, I might lean towards including ""Language disorder"" as well. In the end, I should rank them based on the provided evidence and potential comorbidities, all while ensuring the list adheres to the instructions.

**Defining the diagnosis list**

I need to finalize the top five diagnoses while considering what fits best. I've confirmed Autism Spectrum Disorder and Tourette's disorder as primary candidates. I'm also looking at Stereotypic Movement Disorder and Unspecific Anxiety Disorder.

When it comes to the fifth diagnosis, I’m weighing between Language Disorder and Unspecified Communication Disorder. Although language impairment can be part of ASD, I'm leaning toward listing Language Disorder based on the significant early delay. I’ll go with that to provide a clear diagnostic picture that aligns with the findings.

**Finalizing the diagnoses list**

I'm considering the top five diagnoses, focusing on what's most likely while accounting for comorbidities. Autism Spectrum Disorder and Tourette’s Disorder are definite. I’m also including Stereotypic Movement Disorder for self-injury. 

For the fourth diagnosis, I’m torn between Unspecified Anxiety Disorder and potentially Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, though the latter might not be as strong a candidate. Lastly, I’m leaning towards Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder or even Unspecified Communication Disorder due to early language delays. It feels right to focus on what's most relevant for this case.

**Clarifying the diagnoses criteria**

I’m focusing on the diagnoses list and whether to include ""Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder,"" which carries the F42.8 code. But it seems we don’t have supporting OCD symptoms here. Instead, I'm considering ""Unspecified Communication Disorder"" (F80.9) as a better fit since communication issues seem present. 

For the diagnoses order, we might list Autism Spectrum Disorder first, followed by Tourette's Disorder, Stereotypic Movement Disorder, Unspecified Anxiety Disorder, and then possibly Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder as a less likely fifth choice. It feels important to stick closely to the information provided.

**Finalizing diagnoses list**

The patient screams slurs and slaps herself, and while this could point to various disorders, I'll consider them in ranking order. I have Autism Spectrum Disorder (F84.0) as the primary diagnosis, explaining most features. Next is Tourette's Disorder (F95.2), followed by Stereotypic Movement Disorder (F98.4). For the fourth, I’m including Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9), and for the fifth, I'll use Unspecified Communication Disorder (F80.9). This is my final structured list of diagnoses with corresponding codes as requested.

**Evaluating possible diagnoses**

I'm considering language disorder criteria, but we only have a mention of early delay, with no explicit mention of current language deficits. Therefore, I think it's better not to include that diagnosis. Instead, I'll focus on including ""Unspecified communication disorder"" as a placeholder. For the top five diagnoses, I'll list Autism Spectrum Disorder (F84.0) as primary, followed by Tourette's Disorder (F95.2), Stereotypic Movement Disorder (F98.4), Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9), and maybe Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (F42) due to its relevance, even with limited support.

**Finalizing diagnoses**

I'm evaluating a range of potential diagnoses. I considered options like ""Other specified obsessive-compulsive disorder"" and ""Unspecified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder,"" but those might not fit well. After analyzing the symptoms, I'm deciding on the top five diagnoses. First is Autism Spectrum Disorder (F84.0), followed by Tourette's Disorder (F95.2) and Stereotypic Movement Disorder (F98.4). For fourth, I'll choose Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9), and for fifth, I'll include Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (F42) despite some uncertainty.

**Evaluating differential diagnoses**

I’m looking at a variety of potential diagnoses for the user. I see ""Other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder,"" and ""Unspecified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder,"" but those might not fit well. There's a consideration for ""Intermittent explosive disorder,"" but I'm not quite convinced. There are also possible concerns around OCD and ADHD as differentials. I want to be careful about defining these accurately, based on the provided vignette, while being mindful of the need to include plausible options.

**Choosing potential diagnoses**

I’m working through which diagnoses to consider for the user. It looks like I can include the primary ones: Autism Spectrum Disorder, Tourette's Disorder, and Stereotypic Movement Disorder. But for my number four and five, I want to figure out if ""Other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder"" or ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" would fit better. There’s a lot to weigh, like the presence of tics versus obsessions, yet I need to find a way to present these plausible options while emphasizing uncertainty for accuracy.

I’m deciding on the best diagnoses to list given certain symptoms. For the primary, I’ll go with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Secondary options include Tourette's Disorder and Stereotypic Movement Disorder due to self-injurious behavior. For the fourth, I’m considering an Unspecified Anxiety Disorder. As a fifth, the choice is challenging; I might lean towards Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder or ADHD, though the evidence for these isn't strong. Ultimately, my aim is to provide a sensible list without making unsupported claims.

I'm working through the top five likely DSM diagnoses for the case. The primary diagnosis will be Autism Spectrum Disorder. For the second, I'll include Tourette’s Disorder and Stereotypic Movement Disorder, especially given the self-injurious behaviors noted. An Unspecified Anxiety Disorder fits for the fourth slot. Now, the fifth spot is tricky—I’m torn between Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and Unspecified Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. The clues lean towards ADHD due to inattention, but I might justify OCD too. Ultimately, I need to finalize the most plausible options.

I'm working on identifying the top five probable DSM diagnoses for the case and starting with Autism Spectrum Disorder as primary. Next is Tourette’s disorder and Stereotypic Movement Disorder. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder gets the fourth slot. The fifth diagnosis is where I’m stuck between ADHD and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. Given the information, ADHD seems more plausible because of daydreaming, but I do notice a potential link to OCD through the compulsive aspects. Ultimately, I'll finalize the list, sticking to each diagnosis's corresponding F-code.

I'm considering the case here, and I noticed that the first word at 48 months indicates a possible language delay, which suggests a Language Disorder (F80.2) could be appropriate. However, I also question if it can coexist with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The DSM allows this if the language deficits are not better explained by ASD, so I could potentially list it as the fifth diagnosis. 

Ultimately, my refined list includes ASD, Tourette's, Stereotypic Movement Disorder, Unspecified Anxiety Disorder, and Unspecified Communication Disorder, which captures the concern of delayed speech. I’m finalizing those considerations now.

I'm considering including a ""Language Disorder"" due to the first word being spoken at 48 months, which suggests significant language impairment. However, if she has recovered, that may change the assessment. Even at 11, she could still have deficits, but those aren't clearly described. In ASD cases, late first words typically indicate persistent language deficits, so I could see that being relevant. I’ve settled on the list, ultimately deciding on codes for Autism Spectrum Disorder, Tourette's, Stereotypic Movement Disorder, Unspecified Anxiety Disorder, and Unspecified Communication Disorder.","1.

1013,"Ben is a 12 month old infant that presented for a well check to their new pediatrician. Ben’s father indicates the Ben has been without any recent infections or sick exposures, and is up-to-date on immunizations. Ben’s father does recount that “Ben looks very different from our other children. His eyes seem to be space father apart, and his ears look much lower than his siblings when they were babies.” Ben’s father also indicates, “we have a hard time leaving him alone for more than 1 minute before he starts crying loudly; his cry sounds very much like a cat.” Ben was born at 4 lbs 5 oz and had to spend about 1 week in the neonatal intensive care unit for what Ben’s dad reports was “something to do with his heart; it was the wrong shape or something.” Ben has had to meet with a pediatric gastroenterologist since birth for problems related to feeding. Ben’s father reports they met with a geneticist about 2 weeks ago, and they are awaiting the results from that testing. On direct exam by pediatrician, the patient is noted to have rather diffuse hypotonia, excessive drooling, a small head and jaw, and a fixed splitting of the second heart sound.",Cri-du-chat Syndrome (Q93.4); Unspecified neurodevelopmental disorder (F89.0),"Hard. While this diagnosis can be made with the aforementioned clinical signs, confirmation is typically done by genetic testing, which is yet to be determined here.",judah_weathers,,,,"**Evaluating primary diagnosis**

I'm considering using GDD as the primary diagnosis since the signs indicate global delays, even if they aren't explicitly described. But I wonder if F89 might be a safer option to avoid making unfounded assumptions. The prompt does expect a clear diagnosis, which could be acceptable. As an expert, I would identify the syndrome and relate it to a developmental delay without mentioning the syndrome directly. Still, diagnosing GDD seems valid given the hypotonia, microcephaly, and congenital anomalies, but I feel unsure if that's enough.

**Analyzing the case vignette**

I need to examine the vignette closely. It's about a 12-month-old at a check-up. The father mentions dysmorphic features such as wide-spaced eyes and low-set ears. The child cries loudly when left alone for over a minute, exhibiting a cat-like cry. He was born low weight and spent time in the NICU with a congenital heart defect. There are eating issues, hypotonia, and microcephaly noted during the exam, but there's no mention of developmental delays, communication, or social engagement. I’m pondering how the hypotonia might impact gross motor skills, but it isn’t specifically stated.

**Considering differential diagnosis**

At 12 months, certain behaviors could be typical, but I see no clear psychiatric symptoms, other than potential developmental delays and feeding issues. I think our differential diagnosis should look at neurodevelopmental disorders that might stem from a genetic syndrome, such as cri-du-chat. Among psychiatric diagnoses, I could consider “Global developmental delay (provisional),” “Unspecified neurodevelopmental disorder,” or “Intellectual disability.” There’s also “Feeding disorder” and “Autism spectrum disorder,” as well as “Unspecified communication disorder.” I'll check the relevant ICD-10 codes for these conditions.

**Determining relevant diagnoses**

They’re looking for DSM-5-TR diagnoses, and I’m wondering if ""Rumination disorder"" (F98.21) fits here under feeding and eating disorders since it isn’t described. Alternatively, there’s also ""Feeding and eating disorder, unspecified"" (F50.9). I think the top five diagnoses might be:

1. Global developmental delay - F88
2. Intellectual developmental disorder, unspecified severity - F79
3. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder - F50.82
4. Autism spectrum disorder - F84.0
5. Unspecified communication disorder - F80.9

I wonder about including Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD - F82) but it's likely not due to hypotonia related to the medical condition. However, including unspecified neurodevelopmental disorder (F89) might make sense as a catch-all, even though we’ve already covered GDD and ID.

**Finalizing psychiatric diagnoses**

I need to provide a structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses. While it’s unusual to list both Global developmental delay (F88) and unspecified neurodevelopmental disorder together, it’s acceptable as differentials. Here’s my set of five diagnoses:

1. Global developmental delay - F88
2. Intellectual developmental disorder, unspecified severity - F79
3. Autism spectrum disorder - F84.0
4. Unspecified communication disorder - F80.9
5. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder - F50.82

This list reflects the symptoms while ensuring clear distinctions without coding duplicates.

**Finalizing psychiatric diagnoses**

I’m focusing on creating a list of top DSM-5-TR diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms. After considering various options, here's what I think will work best:

1. Global developmental delay - F88
2. Intellectual developmental disorder, unspecified severity - F79
3. Unspecified feeding or eating disorder - F50.9 (or possibly ARFID - F50.82)
4. Autism spectrum disorder - F84.0
5. Unspecified communication disorder - F80.9

These diagnoses reflect the current information available and adhere to the DSM-5-TR classifications.

**Confirming final diagnoses with ICD-10 codes**

I'm focusing on delivering clear psychiatric diagnoses along with their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes. Here’s my final list:

1. Global developmental delay - ICD-10 F88
2. Intellectual developmental disorder, unspecified severity - ICD-10 F79
3. Unspecified feeding or eating disorder - ICD-10 F50.9
4. Autism spectrum disorder - ICD-10 F84.0
5. Unspecified communication disorder - ICD-10 F80.9

While ""Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder"" (F50.82) seems plausible given the feeding issues, the unspecified category is safer due to the current lack of definitive symptoms.","1. Global developmental delay - ICD-10 F88

The patients complaints were corroborated by his mother who was also in attendance for the appointment.",Hallucinogen persistent perception disorder (F16.983),Easy,judah_weathers,,,,"**Determining diagnostic codes**

I'm analyzing the ICD-10-CM codes related to hallucinogen use and disorders. F16.983 refers to hallucinogen persisting perception disorder. For hallucinogen abuse, there's F16.10, but psychiatry generally uses F16.1 for abuse and F16.2 for dependence. I note the DSM-5's use disorder specifiers and the possible variation in crosswalks. To list five likely diagnoses, we need to consider conditions like ""Hallucinogen use disorder, in sustained remission” but might not have enough information for that. I'll ensure to include plausible differential diagnoses.

**Considering potential diagnoses**

I'm exploring possible diagnoses related to visual hallucinations. While ""Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder"" might fit, he denies other symptoms, making it less likely. There’s also ""Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder, with hallucinations,"" but he denies ongoing substance use. ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" doesn't seem right either. I might consider ""Unspecified anxiety disorder,"" and ""Other specified hallucinogen-related disorder"" is an option, but it doesn't exist in the DSM. I could look into hallucinogen-induced disorders, but his symptoms don’t align well. It's a bit tricky!

**Analyzing possible diagnoses**

The patient's persistent perceptual changes suggest Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (HPPD). If criterion B isn't met, I could list ""Other specified hallucinogen-related disorder (subthreshold HPPD)"" instead. For DSM coding, I might use ""Other Specified Hallucinogen-Related Disorder"" with ICD-10 code F16.99. To be cautious, I'll list HPPD as the primary diagnosis. Other possibilities could be hallucinogen use disorder, unspecified schizophrenia, and unspecified anxiety disorders. The patient's visual experiences, like static or light trails, might hint at ""visual snow syndrome,"" a neurological condition not in the DSM.

**Reviewing potential diagnoses**

I’m considering the possibility of migraine aura or occipital seizures, but the patient denies any seizures or head trauma. Since I need to focus solely on psychiatric diagnoses, I can't include ""Other specified disorder due to another medical condition."" For the top five DSM diagnoses, I think we can list: (1) Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder, (2) Unspecified hallucinogen-related disorder, (3) Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder, (4) Schizophrenia spectrum disorder, and (5) Unspecified anxiety disorder or somatic symptom disorder if there’s preoccupation. I’ll need to provide appropriate ICD-10 codes too!

**Verifying diagnosis codes**

I’m trying to confirm the ICD-10 codes for substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder. Initially, I thought it might be F16.951 or F16.950 for hallucinogen-induced psychotic disorder. While F16.959 could apply, I need to focus on the top five DSM diagnoses. I need to base my list on available information while being cautious about not asserting a diagnosis. For the primary diagnosis, I’ll select Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (F16.983). For secondary diagnoses, I might include ""Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder"" (F28), and other suitable options as differentials. It’s a lot to sift through!

**Verifying substance-induced disorders**

I’m digging into the DSM-5 classifications for substance-related disorders, particularly focusing on hallucinogens. Under this category, there are various disorders, including hallucinogen use disorder and hallucinogen-induced psychotic disorder. I’m considering whether to use ""Other hallucinogen-induced disorder"" or ""Unspecified hallucinogen-related disorder,"" as those codes might fit better.

I need to establish the top five likely diagnoses, starting with Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (F16.983) as the primary, while considering secondary options like substance-induced psychotic disorder and unspecified anxiety disorder. It’s a lot to sort through, but I’m making progress!

**Deciding on diagnoses**

I'm considering the best ICD-10 codes for substance-induced psychotic disorder. I’m looking at F16.959 as an option, which represents ""hallucinogen use unspecified"" with unspecified psychotic disorder. But I also need to ensure accuracy.

My primary focus will be on Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (HPPD), along with some plausible secondary options, like unspecified schizophrenia spectrum disorder and psychotic disorder due to another medical condition. I definitely want to avoid duplicates but need a range of secondaries even if they're not confirmed, given the complexities involved!

**Selecting differential diagnoses**

I need to identify four plausible diagnoses for this case: Hallucinogen Use Disorder (in sustained remission), Psychotic Disorder due to another medical condition, Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder, and perhaps Illness Anxiety Disorder or Unspecified Anxiety Disorder. 

Next, I’ll confirm the correct F-codes for each, focusing on clarity and accuracy. For example, Illness Anxiety Disorder is F45.21, while Unspecified Anxiety Disorder is F41.9. 

I'll also evaluate Hallucinogen Use Disorder codes and assess if HPPD is the primary diagnosis—this needs careful consideration since I can't fabricate details but must provide a structured and plausible differential.

**Finalizing differential diagnoses**

I’m evaluating several diagnoses to provide a structured list with F-codes. For the primary diagnosis, I’ll consider “Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder” (F16.983). 

Then, for the four secondary diagnoses, I might include: 
1. Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder, with hallucinations (F16.951) 
2. Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder (F29) 
3. Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (F06.2) 
4. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9). 

I’ll confirm each code’s accuracy to ensure it aligns with DSM criteria, refining them as needed!

**Choosing differential diagnoses**

I’m sorting through potential diagnoses for this case. Starting with Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (HPPD) as the primary diagnosis is essential given the visual disturbances. Next, I might consider “Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition” as second (F06.2) due to its relationship with perceptual changes. For the third, “Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder” (F28) makes sense. Fourth could be “Hallucinogen-Induced Psychotic Disorder” (F16.951), and lastly, I’m considering “Unspecified Anxiety Disorder” (F41.9). I need to ensure these choices reflect likelihood based on the information provided!

**Finalizing diagnoses order**

Here’s the structured list of diagnoses I’ve settled on:  

1. Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder - F16.983

I'm considering using ICD-10 codes, specifically for depressive disorders. It seems that ""Other depressive episodes"" is F32.8, while ""Other specified depressive disorder"" might also map to that. I think F32.89 could work for ""Other specified depressive disorder (short-duration depressive episode)."" The user asked for specific ICD-10 F-codes, possibly ICD-10-CM codes like F43.25 or F32.89. I need to focus on actual diagnoses, not just ruling out options. Let’s keep it structured!

**Identifying potential diagnoses**

I'm evaluating possible diagnoses considering one week of symptoms causing impairment. ""Adjustment disorder with depressed mood"" seems fitting, and I wonder about including suicidal ideation as a specifier. I also think about ""Parent-child relational problem,"" but that’s a Z code and not allowed. I’m not convinced by ""Intermittent explosive disorder"" since there are no outbursts, and aggression doesn't meet the criteria. 

To fill out the five diagnoses, I can list:  
1. Adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct - F43.25.  
2. Other specified depressive disorder (short-duration depressive episode) - F32.89.  
3. Unspecified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder - F91.9.

**Reviewing possible diagnoses**

I’m considering ""Oppositional defiant disorder"" (F91.3), but it needs a six-month duration, which doesn't fit. While I could include it as a differential diagnosis, it's less likely given the short timeframe. I think ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" could be an alternative, but I can't list both ""other specified"" and ""unspecified"" together. 

I also ponder including ""Major depressive disorder, single episode, provisional,"" but that's not in DSM-5. Other options like ""Generalized anxiety disorder,"" ""ADHD,"" and ""Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder"" don't seem to fit either.

**Compiling potential diagnoses**

To create a list, I'm thinking about starting with ""Adjustment disorder"" as the primary diagnosis, followed by ""Other specified depressive disorder."" Then I can include ""Unspecified disruptive impulse-control disorder"" and ""Oppositional defiant disorder"" (ODD). However, I realize ODD and Conduct disorders need longer durations, which complicates things. 

""Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder"" (DMDD) isn't suitable either because of its requirements for severe outbursts. Instead, ""Unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder"" (F43.9) might fit since it addresses symptoms stemming from a stressor, aligning with adjustment disorder criteria. Now, I have to think about four secondary diagnoses.

**Finalizing probable diagnoses**

I’m trying to create a structured list of the top five most likely diagnoses based on the user’s symptoms. I'm considering starting with ""Adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct"" as the primary diagnosis. For secondary diagnoses, I could include ""Other specified depressive disorder"" and ""Major depressive disorder, single episode (provisional)."" 

Although I think about including ""Oppositional defiant disorder"" and ""Conduct disorder,"" those don’t fit the timeframe, so I'm leaning towards alternatives. Ultimately, the goal is to provide plausible diagnoses, even if some are tentative. This allows for a comprehensive view while highlighting the possible overlaps.

**Formatting final diagnoses list**

I can include ""Depressive disorder, unspecified"" as an alternative, but that’s too similar to ""Other specified."" I also considered ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder,"" but it doesn't fit. For my final list of diagnoses, I’ll settle on:

1. Adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct - F43.25  
2. Other specified depressive disorder (short-duration depressive episode) - F32.89  
3. Major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate - F32.1  
4. Oppositional defiant disorder - F91.3  
5. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder - F34.81  

I’ll ensure that these codes accurately reflect my selections.","1. Adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct - F43.25

1016,"Patient is a 59-year-old female with an unassessed complex trauma history presenting with not-just-right sensations related to hair and bumps growing on her face that cause substantial distress, despite acknowledging that the hairs and bumps are not always physically present. To manage this distress, she keeps tweezers on her person at all times, checks mirrors every 30 minutes when at home, and avoids staying home for extended periods. She also exhibits contamination concerns manifesting as excessive handwashing (25+ times daily) and using barriers to avoid direct contact with ""unclean"" surfaces out of fear of contracting an illness. Patient believes that she must act on her physical sensations or contamination-related thoughts most of the time or the distress will persist. Patient also collects items like My Little Ponies and Trolls. She has filled her home, garage, basement, a rented warehouse, and now pays to store items in a neighbor's garage despite saying she has little to no money to pay for these expenses. She expresses strong attachment to these possessions, stating she would ""NEVER"" sell them, and has a history of repurchasing items she previously attempted to sell. Patient's medical history is significant for AIDS (diagnosed 2003, currently on Odefsey), and past surgical interventions following a car accident. Her psychological history includes previous diagnoses of PTSD and Bipolar Disorder (which she disputes). Current symptoms of a major depressive episode include anhedonia, restlessness, sleep disturbance (averaging 4 hours nightly), feelings of worthlessness, and difficulty concentrating. These episodes emerge roughly every few month. The patient denied symptoms of psychosis as well as symptoms related to higher than usual energy or goal-directed activity at any time in the past. She endorsed suicidal ideation without current plan or intent, rating likelihood of attempt at 1%. Social support is reportedly limited, with the patient living alone with her two dogs, having infrequent contact with her daughter, and minimal social connections beyond casual acquaintances while shopping. She denied distress or functional impairment resulting from any traumatic events.","Obsessive-compulsive disorder with poor insight (F42.2); hoarding disorder with excessive acquisition (F42.3); major depressive disorder (moderate, recurrent) (F33.1)",,brian_zaboski,,,,"**Ranking psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm ranking possible psychiatric diagnoses: OCD at the top, followed by hoarding disorder, recurrent major depressive disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, and then considering either PTSD or somatic symptom disorder. I have to examine the details carefully since the question asks for a structured list based only on provided information, focusing on the top five likely diagnoses based on evidence. The vignette shows a 59-year-old female with trauma history experiencing significant distress related to her appearance.

**Examining patient behaviors**

The patient shows contamination fears with excessive handwashing, over 25 times daily, and avoids ""unclean"" surfaces due to fear of illness. She feels compelled to act on her contamination-related thoughts and sensations to prevent distress. Additionally, she collects characters like My Little Ponies and Trolls, filling her home and other storage spaces, despite financial struggles. She strongly refuses to sell these items, even repurchasing previous possessions. Her medical history includes an AIDS diagnosis and past surgical interventions after a car accident, along with disputed psychiatric diagnoses of PTSD and bipolar disorder.

**Reviewing symptoms of depression**

The patient exhibits symptoms of a major depressive episode, such as anhedonia, restlessness, sleep disturbances averaging 4 hours a night, feelings of worthlessness, and trouble concentrating, occurring every few months. She denies any psychotic symptoms or elevated energy levels in the past. While she endorses suicidal thoughts, her risk is low, estimating a 1% chance of an attempt. Her social support is limited, living alone with two dogs, having infrequent contact with her daughter, and minimal social connections. Key psychiatric syndromes to consider include OCD, depressive episodes, contamination obsessions, and possible trauma.

**Analyzing symptoms of OCD and BDD**

The patient experiences classic OCD symptoms, including recurrent, intrusive thoughts about contamination and fear of illness from unclean surfaces, leading to excessive handwashing over 25 times a day and using barriers to avoid contact. She feels driven to act on these thoughts to alleviate distress. There are also indications of compulsions, like checking mirrors every 30 minutes and carrying tweezers, showing good insight into her condition. However, it's important to differentiate this from body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), which focuses on perceived appearance defects and related behaviors.

**Distinguishing OCD and BDD symptoms**

The patient experiences ""not-just-right"" sensations about hair and bumps on her face, indicating possible preoccupation with physical sensations rather than just appearance. Her compulsions include mirror checking and using tweezers, which align with grooming behaviors seen in body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). However, her contamination fears manifest through OCD, evident in excessive handwashing and the need for barriers to avoid illness. 

Diagnoses to consider include OCD, hoarding disorder, recurrent major depressive disorder, and potentially BDD or somatic symptom disorder. Each diagnosis needs careful consideration based on her symptoms and insights.

**Finalizing top diagnoses**

Given all the details, it seems the primary diagnosis could still be OCD, but BDD might be a secondary concern due to overlapping features. I’ll list the top five diagnoses based on what's evident: 

1. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) - F42  
2. Hoarding Disorder - F42.3  
3. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, unspecified - F33.9  
4. Body Dysmorphic Disorder - F45.22  
5. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) - F43.10  

While PTSD could be less likely given her lack of current impairment, I feel it’s reasonable to include it based on her history.

**Analyzing potential diagnoses**

I'm considering the interplay between OCD, BDD, hoarding, MDD, and possibly PTSD. While BDD is categorized under OCRD in DSM-5, it typically requires preoccupation with perceived physical flaws. The user has sensations related to hair and bumps, leading to significant distress and repetitive behaviors, indicating BDD might be plausible, though it’s not fully typical due to her avoidance of home instead of social situations. 

I’ll finalize a list of the top five likely diagnoses:

1. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) - F42  
2. Hoarding Disorder - F42.3  
3. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, unspecified - F33.9  
4. Body Dysmorphic Disorder - F45.22  
5. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (history) - F43.10 

I need to ensure any evidence supports my choices for these diagnoses.

**Refining potential diagnoses**

I'm considering the possibilities, including specific phobias like germs, obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, and body-focused repetitive behavior disorder. I’m leaning towards including trichotillomania, but the criteria for hair loss isn't met. 

I have my confirmed top five diagnoses as follows:

1. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder - F42.2 (Mixed obsessional thoughts and acts)  
2. Hoarding Disorder - F42.3  
3. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, unspecified - F33.9  
4. Body Dysmorphic Disorder - F45.22  
5. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (history) - F43.10  

I need to ensure these accurately reflect the symptoms presented.

**Listing diagnoses with F-codes**

I need to finalize my top five diagnoses in the required structured format. Here they are:

1. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (mixed obsessional thoughts and acts) - F42.2  
2. Hoarding Disorder - F42.3  
3. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, unspecified - F33.9  
4. Body Dysmorphic Disorder - F45.22  
5. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder - F43.10  

This gives a clear overview for the user while ensuring it's concise and follows the instructions accurately!

**Considering final diagnoses**

I'm thinking we should be cautious with diagnosing the user since they've denied any impairment or symptoms of traumatic events. Based on the information, I want to list possible diagnoses, focusing on OCD, hoarding disorder, major depressive disorder, and body dysmorphic disorder, which gives me four solid options. For the fifth, perhaps I could consider ""Other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder"" due to the tweezing behavior. I’ll finalize my list accordingly!

**Finalizing potential diagnoses**

I'm considering the key features necessary for assessment. The user’s history suggests various possibilities, including hoarding disorder and major depressive disorder (MDD), but the vignette indicates she has not exhibited signs of PTSD lately. While she collects items, her inability to discard doesn’t signify typical hoarding as it lacks severe distress. The episodes of depression don’t meet all criteria for recurrent episodes either. Also, previous diagnoses might play a role, but I should focus on current symptoms without making assumptions. Ultimately, I need a structured approach for the five diagnostic options.

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

I’m analyzing the user's condition thoroughly. Given the absence of classic symptoms for bipolar disorder and PTSD, those are weak choices. I’m leaning toward including “Other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder” due to grooming habits. Options like ""Excoriation disorder"" or ""Trichotillomania"" come up, but they require certain physical signs. I’m concluding with a core list: primary “Obsessive-compulsive disorder,” secondary “Hoarding disorder,” “Major depressive disorder,” “Body dysmorphic disorder,” and “Posttraumatic stress disorder” by history. I’ll ensure to include the correct ICD-10 codes for clarity.

**Confirming diagnostic codes**

I’m clarifying the codes for different disorders. Hoarding disorder is coded as 300.3 (F42) in DSM-5, but in ICD-10-CM, it’s F42.3, so I'll go with that. For Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD), the code is 300.7 (F45.22), which I’ll use. Checking the OCD code, it appears as F42.2 for mixed obsessional thoughts and acts, but DSM-5 states it as 300.3 (F42). Since there are mixed obsessions and compulsions, I’ll stick with F42.2!","1. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (mixed obsessional thoughts and acts) - F42.2  
2. Hoarding disorder - F42.3

1017,"The patient is a 25-year-old male who presented with delayed responses and was vaping during intake. He currently works full-time managing his hot tub repair company and lives with his girlfriend. His medical history includes multiple substance addictions, particularly opioids (requiring Suboxone and later Methadone treatment), and previous diagnoses of OCD, ADHD, anxiety disorder, and depressive disorder. He reports a significant history of head trauma (8 concussions), one seizure episode while incarcerated, and multiple incarcerations for offenses including gun possession, burglary, and vehicle theft. His psychiatric medication history includes Adderall, Concerta, Zoloft, an unspecified antidepressant, and Trazodone. The chief complaint involves symptoms that began at approximately age 18 during his first incarceration and have intensified in the past year, coinciding with work stress. Problematic behaviors include arranging items in specific places with extreme rigidity (unable to buy new items that don't have a ""place""), performing rituals in sets of three, and a specific handwashing ritual. He experiences intrusive thoughts about harming others (particularly fears of stabbing, shooting, or raping strangers) and engages in compulsive behaviors (brushing his hand from hairline to ear three times) to alleviate associated anxiety. He also reports persistent checking behaviors due to memory doubts, a need for things to feel ""just right"", and specific ordering rituals. Additionally, he endorses current anhedonia, decreased appetite, fatigue, and concentration difficulties that wax and wane every few months. He shared that these symptoms are distressing, though mildly impairing in his social, work, and leisurely activities. He denies current suicidality, self-harm, or hallucinations/delusions. He reports a childhood history of conduct problems (skipping school, lying, stealing, fighting) and adult behaviors including illegal activities, irresponsibility, deceitfulness (e.g., using fake identifications) and reported guiltlessness after harming others or damaging property. His childhood conduct problems (e.g., fighting) have resulting in the concussions reported in the medical history, and his illegal activities have resulted in two incarcerations. When asked about one such activity (stealing a car), he reported no remorse, instead blaming the victim for calling the police. The assessment revealed that these behaviors have continued for years in multiple settings, though as of late, he reported that he has not engaged in any illegal activities because he does not want to return to jail for a third time.","Obsessive-compulsive disorder, fair insight (F42.2); Recurrent Major Depressive Disorder (mild) (F33.0); antisocial personality disorder (F60.2)",,brian_zaboski,,,,"**Clarifying opioid use disorder diagnosis**

I think I should phrase it as ""Opioid use disorder, in remission"" and consider using F11.21 to reflect that. The text mentions a medical history with opioid addictions requiring treatments like Suboxone and Methadone, which raises the question of whether this means he’s still actively using opioids. ""History includes"" usually suggests past usage, but it could be ongoing. To be cautious, I might go with ""Opioid use disorder, severe, in sustained remission (on maintenance therapy),"" unless I find more details.

**Determining opioid use disorder diagnosis**

It seems he previously required treatment for opioid use disorder, indicating he met the criteria in the past. The DSM allows for diagnosing in remission if he's been free of symptoms for three months, but I don’t have enough information to confirm that. The user asked for the top five diagnoses, and it's fine to include past disorders, which matters for psychiatric evaluations. I think I could list ""Opioid use disorder, severe, on agonist therapy,"" but I can't specify remission status or severity without more details.

**Assessing diagnosis codes**

His history of requiring methadone suggests a severe condition, but it's not definitive. The mention of multiple substance addictions, especially opioids, likely indicates a moderate to severe issue, so I think F11.20 would be appropriate. For ADHD, while there’s a previous diagnosis, I don’t have enough current evidence to confirm it based on DSM criteria. The user asked for the top five diagnoses, so I’ll also consider possible OCD, antisocial personality disorder, opioid use disorder, depressive disorder, and ADHD. I’ll check the corresponding codes to ensure accuracy.

**Formatting the diagnosis list**

Alright, let's deliver the list, ensuring the format is perfect:  

1. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) - F42  
2. Antisocial personality disorder - F60.2  
3. Opioid use disorder, moderate/severe - F11.20  
4. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, unspecified - F90.9  
5. Depressive disorder, unspecified - F32.A

1018,"Patient is a 25-year-old transgender male currently living with parents who are reportedly non-supportive, and he works as a hospital lab technician. He presents with severe symptoms characterized primarily by intrusive thoughts related to morality, contamination, and harm. Unwanted thoughts include fears of transmitting sexual fluids to others (which he believes would make him ""a rapist""), concerns about accidentally killing insects, moral distress about consuming animal products, and beliefs that viewing violent media constitutes ""condoning"" violence. To manage these thoughts, he engages in extensive reassurance seeking, repeatedly checking lab results at work, avoiding video games and television, dietary restrictions, and some handwashing. He reports these symptoms significantly interfere with daily functioning, preventing him from living independently. They cause intense distress that frequently culminates in panic attacks. Patient has a complex history related to his gender identity, reporting he has identified as male throughout his life despite being assigned female at birth. He is currently taking low-dose testosterone but conceals this from his family, who he believes are interfering with his plans for gender-affirming surgeries. He reported childhood ""delusions"" about being ""from a fantasy world and chosen by gods"" that resolved by age 18. Patient previously took fluvoxamine for panic symptoms until approximately age 24, reporting significant symptom exacerbation upon discontinuation. He describes himself as introverted with limited social connections, identifying as asexual, though questioning if this might be avoidance related to triggering thoughts. His social anxiety dates back to middle and high school, when he was ""pretty much mute"" with few friends. Patient describes his mood as ""always a little depressed"" with recent intensification. He endorses feeling sad, empty, and hopeless most days, anhedonia, sleep disturbances, psychomotor retardation, fatigue, worthlessness, guilt, concentration difficulties, and suicidal ideation. He frequently believes he ""needs to be dead"" and that suicide would be ""the moral thing to do"" following morally repugnant intrusive thoughts, though he denies current plan or intent (estimating a 5% chance of suicide within three months). He struggles with activities of daily living without parental support and expresses frustration that his thoughts and behaviors interfere with his gender expression. Despite these significant symptoms, he demonstrates good insight, noting that his thoughts are not consistent with who he is and what he values.","Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder with good insight (F42.2); Gender Dysphoria in Adults, posttransition (F64.0); Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Moderate (F32.1)",,brian_zaboski,,,,"**Clarifying diagnosis codes**

I’m looking into the ICD-10 codes for OCD, which is F42, but in ICD-10-CM that requires additional digits, like F42.2 for mixed obsessional thoughts and acts. The user likely wants specific codes, so I’ll go with ""Obsessive-compulsive disorder"" - F42.2. For major depression disorder (MDD), I'll choose F32.2 for a single episode, severe without psychotic features, since the indication is that the user may experience chronic low mood. I’ll also note other relevant codes for social anxiety and gender dysphoria.

**Evaluating diagnoses**

I’m considering panic disorder, which is F41.0, but I think persistent depressive disorder (PDD) might be more likely. I need to identify the top five possible diagnoses. PDD could be more probable than panic disorder, since the user has been describing long-standing symptoms like “always a little depressed.” I could also consider generalized anxiety disorder but that doesn’t fit as well. Other possibilities include obsessive-compulsive disorder with good insight and social anxiety disorder. I’ll make sure to prioritize these in the final list.

**Finalizing diagnoses list**

I’m considering including ""Obsessive-compulsive disorder"" as F42.2 in the diagnoses, along with major depressive disorder as F32.2, social anxiety disorder as F40.10, gender dysphoria as F64.1, and persistent depressive disorder as F34.1. I’m wondering if I should specify ""with panic attacks,"" especially since he has experienced them frequently. I could consider adding panic disorder since he took fluvoxamine for panic symptoms, but the history is a bit murky. I’ll weigh all of this carefully.

**Analyzing panic and OCD symptoms**

I’m pondering whether he has panic disorder or if the panic attacks might relate to OCD. Fluvoxamine was used for panic symptoms, but perhaps that was a misattribution; maybe his intrusive thoughts induce panic instead. When he stopped taking fluvoxamine at age 24, things worsened. His panic attacks seem linked to obsessions rather than being unexpected, so diagnosing panic disorder doesn’t fit. Perhaps ""OCD with panic attacks"" could be mentioned, but I’m leaning away from that. His chronic depressive symptoms may stem from OCD-related impairment and family issues. It looks like he meets the criteria overall.","1. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (mixed obsessional thoughts and acts) - F42.2

1019,"Patient is a 47-year-old female residing in the Northeastern United States who recently lost her job due to alleged ""disorganization"", which she contests as the actual reason for termination. Currently unemployed but financially stable for the near term, she is pursuing employment opportunities abroad with plans to relocate to Vietnam in September 2021. The patient lives alone with no local support system and has recently withdrawn from her social connections following concurrent stressors of job loss and the death of her pet cat, expressing irritation with friends' ""bad advice"". She denies substance use, maintains good physical health aside from requiring iron supplementation, and reports a childhood head injury at age 11 without loss of consciousness. Patient describes longstanding organizational tendencies dating back to approximately age 8, recalling precise block stacking and meticulous desk organization throughout her schooling. These behaviors were particularly pronounced during her high school years when her family sponsored relatives' citizenship, resulting in 16 people residing in her home. She demonstrates consistent contamination-related behaviors, including using barriers when touching public surfaces, frequent hand sanitization (predating the pandemic), and immediate cleaning of any perceived contamination. The patient engages in regular cleaning throughout the day, reporting an inability to tolerate ""a single dirty dish in the sink"" and an immediate need to address any uncleanliness she observes. Notably, she denies these behaviors cause distress or any impairment, stating she ""enjoys"" cleaning and maintaining organization. Patient reported persistent depressed mood, anhedonia, restlessness, fatigue, and feelings of worthlessness over the past two weeks, but said that these symptoms are manageable. She denies current or past suicidal ideation. While she denies feeling ""up"", ""high"", or ""hyper"", she describes persistent irritability manifesting as social withdrawal and increased argumentativeness, characterizing herself as ""more lucid"" than others because she doesn't ""follow the script"". She denies symptoms consistent with mania or hypomania, including grandiosity, decreased need for sleep, pressured speech, racing thoughts, distractibility, or increased goal-directed activity. The patient acknowledges experiencing an unspecified ""extremely traumatic event"" but denies re-experiencing it in distressing ways. Assessment ruled out panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, substance use disorders, psychotic disorders, eating disorders, and generalized anxiety disorder.","Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, mild (F33)",,brian_zaboski,,,,"**Analyzing potential disorders**

I need to choose five disorders, even if some aren't very certain. For instance, we might include ""Other specified depressive disorder,"" but it's essential to find the five most plausible options. I'm thinking about cleaning behaviors and orderliness that have been present from childhood. This could indicate obsessive-compulsive disorder, but it might also just reflect normal preferences. However, the cleaning habits described seem excessive, with consistent contamination-related behaviors that go beyond what's typical. She says she enjoys it, but that doesn't fit perfectly with how OCPD typically presents.

**Assessing potential disorders**

I'm considering that OCPD typically doesn't involve true compulsions like sanitizing, though there can be rigid cleanliness rules. The contamination-related behaviors, such as using barriers on public surfaces, might be more associated with germophobia. The job termination reason involving ""disorganization"" seems contradictory; could she actually have ADHD and use cleaning as a coping mechanism, or be obsessively clean but disorganized at work? Also, she might contest the termination reason, suggesting other underlying issues. Despite planning a move to Vietnam, which might seem impulsive, she lives alone and has withdrawn after recent stressors, indicating possible adjustment issues. Additionally, she denies re-experiencing a traumatic event, but could still show PTSD-like symptoms, which aren't clearly described.

**Evaluating potential diagnoses**

I'm considering whether she might have Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder alongside Major Depressive Disorder, possibly a single episode of mild severity. There's also the possibility of Persistent Depressive Disorder or other specified depressive disorders, but she meets the two-week threshold for MDD, showing five symptoms which could indicate it. I might rank her primary diagnosis as Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and list other options like Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood, or even unspecified trauma-related disorders due to her experiences.

**Finalizing diagnostic considerations**

I’m considering including less likely options, like Unspecified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder, if she doesn’t fully meet the criteria due to lack of distress. However, I feel confident using OCD. I need to ensure I note the ICD-10 F-codes for DSM-5. We want five diagnoses, and if I already have four, we could consider ""Other Specified Depressive Disorder,"" but that's duplicative. Alternatively, ""Unspecified Depressive Disorder"" fits, as does ""Prolonged Grief Disorder,"" which is valid in the DSM-5-TR.

**Examining potential diagnoses**

I'm assessing whether she could have various disorders, like adjustment issues connected to her pet's death, but the criteria require a close person and more intense grief. There’s the possibility of unspecified obsessive-compulsive disorders, but I need to clarify ICD-10 codes like F42 for OCD. I have to include the top five diagnoses, like OCD, Major Depressive Disorder, and Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood. The cleaning behaviors could suggest OCPD, and I’m weighing whether to classify her as having unspecified OCD or a personality disorder as well.

**Finalizing possible diagnoses**

I'm considering a few potential diagnoses, like ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder"" or ""Unspecified personality disorder."" However, I gather more evidence leans toward obsessive-compulsive features. I have to ensure that I correctly use the ICD-10 codes for the primary diagnoses. My top five are: 1. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (F42), 2. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (F60.5), 3. Major depressive disorder, single episode, mild (F32.0), 4. Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood (F43.23), and 5. Unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder (F43.9).

**Deciding on potential diagnoses**

I’m mulling over various possible diagnoses for the situation. I see “Major depressive disorder, single episode, mild” as a contender but am weighing its implications alongside “Adjustment disorder with depressed mood,” especially given recent symptoms. I also consider including both “Obsessive-compulsive disorder” and “Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder” due to observable traits. Other diagnostics could relate to trauma history, but nothing definitive has been described, so I can stick with the five primary choices: OCD, mild MDD, OCPD, adjustment disorder, and unspecified trauma-related disorder.

**Determining potential diagnoses**

I’m considering different diagnoses, including ""Persistent complex bereavement disorder,"" but it’s not applicable since it’s limited to people, not pets. Other options like ""Acute stress disorder"" and certain body-focused repetitive behavior disorders don't fit either. As I gather ICD-10 codes, I need to finalize a list balanced with the most likely diagnoses: “Obsessive-compulsive disorder - F42,” “Major depressive disorder - F32.0,” “Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder - F60.5,” “Adjustment disorder - F43.21,” and “Unspecified trauma-related disorder - F43.9.”

**Finalizing diagnoses**

I'm trying to outline the potential diagnoses carefully. For OCPD, I only see two criteria met, which means I can't confirm it. For OCD, I know we have compulsions but need to determine if they're causing significant distress or impairment. The patient cleans frequently and attempts to avoid contamination, indicating possible OCD traits. Regardless, let's list the diagnoses without additional commentary, sticking to the structure required:

1. Obsessive-compulsive disorder - F42
2. Major depressive disorder, single episode, mild - F32.0
3. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder - F60.5
4. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood - F43.21
5. Unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder - F43.9

**Finalizing diagnostic list**

I'm deciding on the final structured list of psychiatric diagnoses without additional reasoning. After considering various options, I'll go with the following:

1. Obsessive-compulsive disorder - F42  
2. Major depressive disorder, single episode, mild - F32.0  
3. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder - F60.5  
4. Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood - F43.23

1020,"Patient is a 24-year-old gender fluid individual with a BA in creative writing and sociology who is currently living with their parents while taking courses part-time and seeking employment. They describe their living situation as ""overwhelming"" due to parental boundary issues, though they maintain a supportive romantic relationship since 2019. Their psychiatric history includes diagnoses of MDD and GAD at age 15-16, PTSD in 2016 following emotional abuse by high school friends, and ADHD in 2018 (without neuropsychological evaluation). Current medications include Lisdexamfetamine 50mg (since 2018), various supplements, and a contraceptive injection. They previously tried multiple antidepressants (2011-2015) but discontinued each after approximately two weeks due to suicidal ideation and, in one case, motor disturbances. The patient consumes alcohol socially (3-5 drinks monthly) and has been vaping marijuana 1-3 times weekly for three months primarily to aid sleep and manage anxiety. The patient's primary symptoms onset around age 5 with intrusive visualizations of falling down stairs along with perfectionism through rewriting notes until they felt ""just right"". Currently, they experience significant distress when surroundings are not in the ""right spot"", spending up to 12 hours reorganizing belongings without breaks, which would cause severe distress if interrupted. This ""not just right"" feeling impairs their ability to meet deadlines, complete job applications, and fulfill social obligations. They also engage in checking behaviors when packing (counting socks repeatedly, checking for essential items) and experience distressing sexual intrusive thoughts. Additionally, the patient exhibits skin-picking behaviors, spending over an hour picking at ingrown hairs until bleeding, scratching their neck and jaw during conversations, and tearing at cuticles, with symptoms worsening during periods of anxiety. They've attempted to stop by wearing pants constantly but have been unsuccessful. The patient has a significant history of depression with three past suicide attempts (overdoses in 2014, 2015, and 2017) and self-injury through cutting (stopped in 2017). They currently experience passive suicidal ideation, anhedonia, decreased appetite, sleep difficulties, psychomotor agitation, feelings of worthlessness, and concentration problems, though they report 0% chance of self-harm in the next three months. Social anxiety manifests as persistent fear of judgment and rejection, with distressing rumination about social interactions and excessive reassurance-seeking that has cost them friendships. The patient also reported past sexual abuse by a boyfriend for 4-5 months but denied PTSD symptoms. They disclosed a history of binge eating episodes. During the binge, they ate more rapidly than normal and felt disgusted and embarrassed after. After these eating binges, pt fasted for ~3 days. These eating binges occurred <1 time per week, and the patient has not engaged in these behaviors in the past 2 months.","Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (F42.2); Major Depressive Disorder (moderate, recurrent) (F33.1); Social Anxiety Disorder (F40.10); Excoriation Disorder (F42.4); Other Specified Eating Disorder: bulimia nervosa (of low frequency and limited duration) (F50.89)",,brian_zaboski,,,,"**Analyzing mental health conditions**

I'm considering excoriation disorder, which involves recurrent skin picking leading to lesions, where there's a distressing element and difficulty in stopping the behavior. The presence of ingrown hairs and attempts to use pants as a barrier highlight the challenge. 

For depression, the user shows signs of anhedonia, decreased appetite, sleep difficulties, and more, meeting the criteria. Social anxiety disorder is also evident, driven by fear of negative evaluation in social settings for over six months.

**Evaluating psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm assessing persistent fear of judgment and rejection along with rumination and reassurance seeking, which seems to affect friendships. Since the duration is unspecified but suggests over six months, that fits the criteria. 

For OSFED, the user has had binge episodes with compensatory fasting, but frequency is lower than once per week recently, hinting at possible remission. It looks like I should compile a structured list of DSM-5-TR diagnoses, focusing on current and past conditions. The top five likely diagnoses will include OCD, MDD, social anxiety, and excoriation disorder.

**Assessing possible diagnoses**

I'm considering ""Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder"" (OSFED) since it seems to fit the user's symptoms better than ADHD. They have ADHD but there's no mention of typical symptoms. Although they face challenges like meeting deadlines, which could indicate OCD, these concentration problems might also tie back to depression. The binge episodes are less than once a week and haven't occurred in the last two months, so they might be in remission, but they can still be diagnosed as OSFED.

**Considering diagnosis options**

I'm examining whether remission specifiers apply to ""Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder"" (OSFED). For conditions like bulimia and binge eating, there are clear specifiers for remission. However, it seems that OSFED itself might not have formal remission specifiers in the DSM-5, though we might use ""in partial remission."" If the binge behaviors stopped two months ago, I might consider it OSFED in early remission. Alternatively, I could also lean toward an unspecified ADHD diagnosis since they have a history and are on medication.

**Formulating top diagnoses**

I'm focusing on creating a list of the top five most likely diagnoses for the case without providing reasoning. I need to decide between including ADHD or OSFED and possibly drop an existing condition. However, given the details about social anxiety and excoriation, I will keep them in mind as strong candidates.

I will format the final output with the chosen diagnoses and their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes in a numbered list. I’ll ensure to follow the guidelines strictly. Here’s the list:

1. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder - F42  
2. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, moderate - F33.1

1021,"The patient is an 18-year-old non-binary college freshman with a complex psychiatric presentation. They report a history of childhood anxiety, perfectionism, and ritualistic self-punishment behaviors starting in the third grade. Currently, their most debilitating symptom is anxiety about ""contaminated air"" when others cough or sneeze, prompting them to cover their face and hold their breath even when the trigger is far away or on television. They engage in checking and counting behaviors based on the number 3, including checking mirrors while driving, locking/unlocking their car, and tapping their toothbrush. These compulsions are experienced as uncontrollable, with the patient reporting they sometimes modify behaviors (like holding an imaginary door handle in their pocket) when the original compulsion would be disruptive. At approximately age 16, the patient developed anorexia nervosa, restricting their food intake and ultimately requiring intervention from parents and a treatment team. Despite gaining weight under external pressure, the patient continues to restrict eating, has a distinct fear of gaining weight, becoming fat, fasting until dinner, drinking coffee to intentionally upset their stomach. Their BMI currently falls within the normal range. Around the same time their eating disorder developed, the patient experienced depressive symptoms including hopelessness, low motivation, and self-harm behaviors (pulling hair, cutting, punching stomach). They had suicidal ideation during high school, including thoughts of jumping in front of a train and fantasizing about wandering into hallways during a school shooting. Current suicidal thoughts are less frequent and persistent. Current depressive symptoms have been subsyndromal (though not entirely absent) for about 7 months. Specifically, the patient currently denies experiencing depressive symptoms for more than a few hours every couple of weeks but rates their chance of self-harm in the next three months at 50% (suicide attempt chance at 0%). They report minimal alcohol and marijuana use. Notably, the patient expresses resistance to treatment, stating that ""getting better means getting fat"" and feeling they need to ""stay sad for a while longer"".","Obsessive-compulsive disorder (F42.2); Anorexia nervosa, restricting type, in partial remission (F50.014); Major depressive disorder, recurrent, in partial remission (F33.41)",,brian_zaboski,,,,"**Clarifying diagnostic codes**

The prompt specifies ""ICD-10 F-codes,"" so I’ll provide F42, but F42.2 may be better since it addresses obsessions and compulsions. The DSM-5-TR uses code 300.3 for OCD. Moving on to anorexia, DSM-5-TR codes are 307.1 for restricting type and 307.1 for binge-eating/purging type. For MDD, I can list codes like 296.21 and F32.4 for partial remission. GAD has the code 300.02 (F41.1) while OCPD uses 301.4 (F60.5). I need to be cautious about listing both OCD and OCPD.

**Reviewing diagnostic options**

I might want to include ""Unspecified depressive disorder - F32.A"" to cover current subsyndromal symptoms, but we've already noted MDD partial remission, so either could work. For anorexia, I think it's better to go with ""Anorexia nervosa, restricting type, in partial remission - F50.01"" instead of OSFED. The vignette indicates that at age 16, the patient developed restrictive eating, leading to intervention. Despite weight restoration, other anorexia-like symptoms persist, reinforcing the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa in partial remission.

**Assessing anorexia diagnosis**

The ""BMI within normal range"" suggests weight restoration, but it's still partial remission. While the phrase ""developed anorexia nervosa"" indicates a past diagnosis, we can definitely label it as ""Anorexia nervosa, restricting type, in partial remission"" (F50.01) since that seems more clinically appropriate. However, I wonder if it’s safer to choose OSFED instead because their current weight is normal and we can't confirm prior low weight. OSFED atypical anorexia might be a better fit without needing to assume past underweight status. But still, does OSFED apply if they were previously underweight?

**Debating diagnostic categories**

OSFED is usually for cases where low weight criteria aren’t met, but if the individual had anorexia before, diagnosing it as anorexia in partial remission could still be valid. However, OSFED wouldn't reflect that history. The vignette mentions they ""developed anorexia nervosa,"" so that's a strong basis for diagnosis. If we settle on OSFED, we’d acknowledge they aren’t underweight now, but including ""partial remission"" may be appropriate. The user wants a structured list of current diagnoses, which could also allow historical aspects. As for differentials, I’d rank OCD first, followed by anorexia/OSFED, then MDD, generalized anxiety, and maybe OCPD. I wonder if ""anxiety about contaminated air"" could relate to psychosis too.

**Compiling diagnosis list**

For the structured list of diagnoses based on the vignette, my final suggestions are:

1. Obsessive-compulsive disorder - F42  
2. Anorexia nervosa, restricting type, in partial remission - F50.01  
3. Major depressive disorder, single episode, in partial remission - F32.4  
4. Generalized anxiety disorder - F41.1  
5. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder - F60.5  

I weighed the options carefully and included the most relevant codes that match the case details while following the requested format.

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

I need to select the top five most likely diagnoses based on the provided information, ensuring they all have proper F-codes. Given everything, here's the list I'm going with:

1. Obsessive-compulsive disorder - F42  
2. Anorexia nervosa, restricting type (in partial remission) - F50.01  
3. Major depressive disorder, single episode (in partial remission) - F32.4  
4. Generalized anxiety disorder - F41.1  
5. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder - F60.5  

I've aimed for accuracy while considering the patient's symptoms and historical context. It's essential to ensure that the diagnoses are relevant and represent the most significant concerns.

**Choosing final diagnoses**

The primary debilitating symptom identified is anxiety about contaminated air, which points to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Anorexia nervosa is also serious, but given the current symptoms, it could be in partial remission. This aligns with the need to select current diagnoses appropriately for the vignette. 

Here's my finalized list of diagnoses with their corresponding codes:

1. Obsessive-compulsive disorder - F42  
2. Anorexia nervosa, restricting type (in partial remission) - F50.01  
3. Major depressive disorder, single episode (in partial remission) - F32.4

1022,"The patient is a 22-year-old female from the Southeastern United States with a history of Depression (2019), Anxiety (2019), and OCD (March 2021). She recently transitioned from working as a childcare specialist to self-employment as a freelancer. Her medical history includes anemia and IBS, for which she takes daily iron supplements. The patient previously attempted treatment with Zoloft (10mg) for OCD symptoms but discontinued due to emotional blunting effects. She reports consuming alcohol 1-2 glasses a few times monthly and using marijuana daily when available, which she finds helpful for intrusive thoughts despite occasionally triggering anxiety. The patient's most distressing symptoms involve intrusive thoughts about sexually harming children, accompanied by physiological responses that she describes as ""groinal"". These thoughts were particularly distressing during her work as a childcare specialist, where she engaged in compulsive staring at children's genital areas to ""prove"" she wasn't sexually attracted to them and sometimes avoided changing diapers due to fear of sexual arousal. After experiencing an intrusive dream about sexually harming her brother in January 2021, she experienced physical symptoms (shaking, freezing) when interacting with him and subsequently increased their time together as a form of reassurance. Additionally, the patient reports significant health anxiety focused on getting cancer, HIV, and STIs, leading to excessive symptom research. The patient experiences panic attacks (1-2 times monthly) lasting 15-30 minutes when triggered by intrusive thoughts, with symptoms including shortness of breath, crying, sweating, racing heart, chest pain, and feelings of detachment. She reports seeking reassurance from her mother when these thoughts become overwhelming. The patient also endorses distressing and functionally impairing social anxiety in small groups, leading to significant avoidance; however, she stated that this anxiety is primary due to her unwanted/intrusive thoughts rather than a fear of being judged. She reports experiencing over 50 depressive episodes in the past year, each lasting at least two weeks with symptoms including decreased appetite, sleep disturbance, fatigue, guilt, concentration difficulties, and thoughts of death. She described these episodes as challenging to manage, but ""not completely debilitating"".","OCD, mild, fair insight, with panic (F42.2); Illness Anxiety Disorder (F45.21); Major Depressive Episode, recurrent, moderate (F33.1)",,brian_zaboski,,,,"**Evaluating cannabis use disorder criteria**

I think we need to focus on the top 5 diagnoses, and they expect cannabis use disorder to be included. For that, we typically need at least two criteria over 12 months, but I realize we only have frequency data and anxiety triggers. She does continue using despite that anxiety, which could meet one criterion, but it isn't enough on its own. I'm wondering if we could simply classify it as ""Cannabis use, uncomplicated"" instead of a disorder.

**Assessing cannabis diagnosis options**

I'm considering the code F12.90, which stands for ""Cannabis use, unspecified, uncomplicated."" While it fits under F-codes, it doesn't necessarily align with DSM-5 diagnoses. For a DSM-5-TR diagnosis, we really need specific criteria. I can list ""Cannabis Use Disorder, mild,"" but it's not fully supported. On the flip side, ""Cannabis use, uncomplicated"" is an ICD code, not a DSM disorder. It seems better to classify it as ""Cannabis use disorder, mild"" due to daily use and continued use despite anxiety, although even that might be stretching it.

**Exploring potential diagnoses**

I know we need five diagnoses, and while we can exclude cannabis, there are alternatives. For instance, I might consider ""Social Anxiety Disorder"" but exclude ""Panic Attacks."" Still, I can potentially include ""Panic Disorder"" as a differential, though it's uncertain. Other possibilities include ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder"" or ""Unspecified Anxiety Disorder."" There's also ""Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety,"" but that may not fit. Given the history of anxiety and current panic attacks, I think we can reasonably explore GAD or unspecified anxiety. However, her panic attacks might actually meet the full criteria for ""Other Specified Anxiety Disorder"" since they follow common symptoms.

**Evaluating secondary diagnoses**

I’m considering listing ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder"" (F41.1) as a secondary diagnosis, but I realize we don't have clear evidence of excessive worry over several events for at least six months. She does worry about health and intrusive thoughts, but that seems limited. ""Social Anxiety Disorder"" might fit better, as she experiences anxiety in small groups and tends to avoid those situations. Alternatively, ""Specific Phobia"" could relate to diapers, but that seems linked to OCD. I’m also ruling out Body Dysmorphic Disorder, PTSD, Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder, and Autism Spectrum Disorder. For potential secondary diagnoses, we're looking at options like MDD, illness anxiety, other specified anxiety, and possible cannabis use disorder.

**Finalizing secondary diagnoses**

I see we need exactly four secondary diagnoses, so we can include: (1) OCD, (2) MDD, (3) Illness Anxiety, and (4) Other Specified Anxiety, plus our primary. Illness Anxiety Disorder fits due to her significant health-related worries, even if we can’t confirm the duration. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder is plausible for her expected panic attacks. For Cannabis Use Disorder, she uses daily which suggests some criteria might fit, but I realize we might list it as ""Cannabis Use Disorder, mild"" since DSM requires two criteria. I think we need to be careful in making accurate distinctions.

**Confirming diagnoses and codes**

Here’s the final list of diagnoses with their corresponding ICD-10 codes:

1. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Mixed Obsessional Thoughts and Acts - F42.2  
2. Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate - F33.1

1023,"Erik is a 10-year-old male who recently completed 4th grade in a gifted math program. He lives with his biological parents and seven-year-old brother, with whom he has ""constant"" conflict including arguing, screaming, and hitting. Erik has a developmental history of severe temper tantrums prior to age 4, with behavioral challenges emerging in kindergarten and worsening in subsequent grades. His mother reports that her son engages in ""constant defiance"", experiences rapid mood changes, and demonstrates impulsive behavior, including occasional incidents of pulling knives (though never pointing them at anyone). Daily arguments at home frequently escalate to physical aggression, particularly with his mother and brother. Erik has expressed statements such as ""I wish I could go to sleep and never wake up"" and reports feeling depressed ""randomly"" a couple times per month since second or third grade, though he denies daily depressive symptoms or changes in sleep or appetite. Erik's behavioral difficulties have manifested in both home and school environments. In school, he has engaged in speaking out of turn, refusing to follow directions, agitating teachers, and having ""screaming matches"" with staff. Despite these challenges, Erik maintains high grades across subjects (with math being his most difficult class at a B), has several friends, and is described as a leader in social interactions. He has a Section 504 plan that allows for movement opportunities and frequent breaks when needed. In March 2019, Erik began taking 2mg of Guanfacine (extended release) for attention/concentration deficits, which has helped reduce impulsivity and improve behavioral control, though aggressive and defiant behaviors have continued. His mother reports implementing a point system for rewards and consequences but notes limited effectiveness due to inconsistent expectations between parents. Formal assessment indicates that Erik demonstrates a pattern of emotional dysregulation, defiance, and aggressive behavior, with physical aggression occurring approximately every other day at home. Assessment also confirms prior symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, which are present across settings and contribute to emotional dysregulation and academic underperformance relative to ability.","Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Moderate (F91.3); Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Combined Type (F90.2)",,brian_zaboski,,,,"**Considering conduct disorders**

I’m examining conduct disorder, which typically involves peer issues, school problems, and rule-breaking, although a person can still have friends and good grades, but that’s less common. Since this individual doesn’t have severe school rule violations, conduct disorder might not apply. Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) could fit due to impulsive aggressive outbursts, but chronic defiance complicates things. I’m leaning towards Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) because of the context. Ultimately, I’m considering ADHD combined type as primary, and ODD as secondary, with IED needing further evaluation.

**Assessing depressive and conduct disorders**

I’m looking into an unspecified depressive disorder due to passive death wishes and intermittent depressed moods. Then there's conduct disorder, which might be more likely than IED, but it’s tough to distinguish. DMDD could also be a candidate, especially with the details: the mother describes her son as constantly defiant, impulsive, and aggressive, with rapid mood changes. His school behavior further suggests defiance and temper outbursts. This points to patterns of emotional dysregulation and aggression at home, occurring regularly.

**Evaluating ADHD and mood disorders**

I’m assessing symptoms like inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, which indicate ADHD and emotional dysregulation. While I considered ""Other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder,"" that might not be necessary just yet. In this case, DMDD could be relevant if persistently irritable mood is present, but that doesn't seem to be the case here. The rapid mood changes may be typical for ADHD rather than suggestive of chronic irritability. Plus, he has friends and is seen as a leader, which counters the idea of persistent irritability affecting peer relationships.

**Identifying potential disorders**

I think Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) with emotional dysregulation stemming from ADHD fits best. I can list DMDD as a secondary differential but not as the final diagnosis; maybe it could be third. Childhood-onset conduct disorder might be a consideration as fourth, given the aggression and occasional knife involvement, even if he doesn’t meet all criteria. I could also add unspecified depressive disorder as fifth. I'm considering ""Disruptive behavior disorder, unspecified,"" but I need clear DSM categories, and since ODD applies, there's no need for others like Generalized Anxiety Disorder or Autism Spectrum Disorder.

**Finalizing potential diagnoses**

I’m diving into potential diagnoses here! ODD with emotional dysregulation from ADHD seems most fitting. I'd list DMDD as a secondary option but not as the final diagnosis. Conduct disorder is a consideration due to aggression, but we have to be careful since he doesn't fully meet the criteria. Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) could also fit but less likely since it usually requires grossly out-of-proportion aggression. After narrowing down, I think the top five diagnoses are ADHD combined, ODD, DMDD, unspecified depressive disorder, and possibly IED or Conduct disorder. I need to choose based on probability!

**Determining potential diagnoses**

I'm considering various diagnoses and how they fit with the information provided. Major depressive disorder and specific phobia seem unlikely. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) could account for some depressive symptoms and mood changes, but the details are limited. It feels like I should prioritize ODD and ADHD given the aggression and impulsivity. For the top five, I’m leaning towards ADHD, ODD, DMDD, childhood-onset conduct disorder, and unspecified depressive disorder. I’ll also confirm the correct ICD-10 F-codes while ensuring criteria alignment for each diagnosis.

I'm considering various diagnoses and how they fit together. “Reactive attachment disorder” doesn’t apply here, but I might include “Disruptive behavior disorder, unspecified” F91.9. The signs of conflict at home and ADHD suggest emotional dysregulation, with some aggressive tendencies and passive wishes for death. For the top five diagnoses, I’m looking at ADHD, ODD, DMDD, conduct disorder, and unspecified depressive disorder. I need to ensure I present the final list clearly and accurately following the specified format.

I'm thinking through the diagnoses and their designations. For ADHD, I'll use ""Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, combined presentation."" For ODD, it's ""Oppositional defiant disorder."" DMDD is called ""Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder,"" and IED is ""Intermittent explosive disorder."" For unspecified depressive issues, ""Other specified depressive disorder"" seems better given the symptoms are subthreshold, even if not enough detail is provided. So, my final list looks like this:

1. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, combined presentation - F90.2
2. Oppositional defiant disorder - F91.3

His symptoms have included paranoid ideation, auditory and visual hallucinations, delusions (such as believing television was sending special messages), obsessive thoughts, compulsive behaviors, and periods of mania and depression. Dole holds a master’s degree in computer science and previously developed cybersecurity systems but resigned in 2019 due to unmanageable anxiety. He currently lives with his parents, who provide significant assistance with daily activities. Throughout his treatment history, Dole has demonstrated paranoid thoughts beginning at age 19, with recurrent episodes of acute psychosis requiring hospitalization. In 2018, he experienced hallucinations of messages on his phone, and in 2019, he reported seeing ""the devil"" and experiencing auditory hallucinations. He endorses unwanted/intrusive thoughts causing anxiety, which he attempts to neutralize with repetitive behaviors that take 1-3 hours daily. His symptoms include fear of harming himself, violent imagery, concerns about germs, and moral preoccupations. Dole reports deficits in procedural and episodic memory, impairing self-care and accurate recollection of past events. His family history is positive for paternal psychosis, depression with possible bipolar disorder, and a completed suicide. Intake impressions indicate that Dole has experienced (and continues to experience) delusions, hallucinations, disorganized/catatonic behavior, diminished emotional expression, and amotivation within a one-month period. He has exhibited delusions or hallucinations for at least two weeks in the absence of major mood episodes, and his functioning has decreased notably compared to his pre-symptom baseline. Regarding his unwanted/intrusive thoughts, he demonstrates limited insight.","Schizophrenia, Multiple Episodes, Currently in Acute Episode (F20.9); Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Poor Insight (F42.2)",,brian_zaboski,,,,"**Analyzing mood disorders**

I'm considering mood episodes, but they're not clearly predominant. According to DSM-5, diagnosing schizophrenia needs at least six months of continuous symptoms, with a month of active signs. Given the history since age 19, recurrent episodes could point to that diagnosis. However, there's also the thought that it could be comorbid bipolar disorder. Still, if mania occurs without psychosis, that complicates everything. It seems schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, might be the most likely, but I need to weigh the evidence carefully.

**Determining possible diagnoses**

I'm thinking that some clinicians might still diagnose schizoaffective disorder here. My job is to list the top five likely diagnoses based on the information available, with a primary diagnosis. I would lean towards schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type (F25.0), since there are signs of both mania and depression. Using F25.0 seems safest, but there's a possibility for F25.2 if mixed episodes are involved. Schizophrenia (F20.9) could also be included as a secondary diagnosis. I'll weigh these possibilities carefully.

**Exploring Additional Diagnoses**

I'm considering including Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder with poor insight as a secondary diagnosis (F42.2). Autism Spectrum Disorder (F84.0) might also fit in as a secondary differential but lacks enough evidence. There’s a possibility of Narcissistic Personality Disorder (F60.81), based on ICD-10. Additionally, OCD could be related to schizophrenia, creating comorbidity. I’m also thinking about Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1) because of severe anxiety, but the evidence supports OCD more. Lastly, I’ll consider some other specified psychotic disorders, though the symptoms don’t align perfectly.

**Creating a Differential Diagnosis List**

I'm generating a differential diagnosis list that includes primary schizoaffective disorder and several secondary options. The secondary diagnoses might be schizophrenia, OCD, bipolar I disorder, autism spectrum disorder, or schizotypal personality disorder. I'm organizing them in order of plausibility: 1) schizoaffective bipolar type, 2) schizophrenia, 3) OCD, 4) bipolar I disorder, and 5) autism spectrum disorder. However, including schizoaffective, schizophrenia, and bipolar may feel redundant. Ultimately, I'll provide a structured list of the most likely diagnoses and their corresponding ICD-10 codes, keeping in mind the historical context of multiple diagnoses.

**Formulating the Diagnosis List**

At intake, there are reports of delusions and hallucinations for over two weeks without major mood episodes, which fits the criteria for schizophrenia. However, the vignette includes some history of mood episodes, suggesting schizoaffective disorder might be more appropriate. I’ll choose schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type (F25.0) as the primary diagnosis and add OCD (F42.2), schizophrenia (F20.9), bipolar I disorder (F31.9), and possibly generalized anxiety disorder (F41.1) as secondary options. These selections reflect the best evidence while ensuring clarity in the structured list.

**Finalizing the Diagnosis List**

I’m considering autism spectrum disorder (ASD), possibly coding it as F84.0 or F84.5. Given the history of Asperger's, I think F84.0 may be appropriate. However, I have limited evidence for it. I’ll also look at other options like narcissistic personality disorder (F60.81), though there's not enough support. There's strong evidence for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD, F42.2) given symptoms of intrusive thoughts. Ultimately, I’ll draft a final list of diagnoses that includes schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type (F25.0), OCD, and schizophrenia. I want to ensure each code is accurate too!

**Deciding the Primary Diagnosis**

I'm considering the diagnosis for this case. The fifth option might be unspecified anxiety disorder (F41.9) since anxiety and intrusive thoughts are involved, but OCD covers that. I'd rather focus on including schizoaffective disorder as the primary diagnosis, supported by symptoms of mania and depression alongside psychosis for at least two weeks without major mood episodes. So, I’ll finalize the list as schizoaffective disorder, OCD, schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. It’s essential to have the best-supported diagnosis!

**Preparing Final Output**

I'm getting ready to produce the final list of diagnoses and codes as requested. Here we go:

1. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type - F25.0  
2. Obsessive-compulsive disorder, mixed obsessional thoughts and acts (with poor insight) - F42.2  
3. Schizophrenia - F20.9  
4. Bipolar I disorder, current or most recent episode unspecified - F31.9  
5. Autism spectrum disorder - F84.0  

I've made sure to confirm the accuracy of these codes based on the context and historical diagnoses.","1. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type - F25.0

1025,"Patient is a 32-year-old Black American male with no prior diagnostic history who presents with a chief complaint of ""uncontrollable staring, particularly at breasts/genitals"". The patient reports that this behavior began at age 27 (late 2017) and involves involuntary staring at people he does not know well, with particular focus on the genitals/breasts of all genders and ages, including children. He spends approximately six hours per day engaged in or thinking about this behavior, which he cannot control through willpower alone, though he can interrupt it by creating a physical barrier in his line of sight or wearing sunglasses. The patient initially denied but later acknowledged experiencing unwanted sexual thoughts regarding his sexual orientation. This behavior has significantly impaired his functioning, causing him to lose multiple jobs within the past year, avoid family gatherings, limit time in public, and experience relationship strain with his girlfriend of 12 years, with whom he has three children and now stays home while she works. The patient experiences moderate suicidal ideation, including thoughts that he would be better off dead, and reports feeling worthless and guilty, particularly about ""not providing for my children and for staring"". He describes his mood as ""iffy"" and notes increased irritability. While the patient endorsed panic attacks on assessment, follow-up questioning revealed these occur specifically when thinking excessively about his staring behaviors or unemployment, rather than occurring spontaneously. He also endorsed criteria for agoraphobia and social anxiety on screening, though these appear directly related to fears of being judged for his staring behavior. The patient acknowledged witnessing a traumatic event he chose not to disclose but denied re-experiencing or avoidance symptoms consistent with PTSD. Medical history includes hypertension treated with Amlodipine (dose unknown), with no psychiatric medication history reported.Throughout the assessment, the patient demonstrated limited insight into his symptoms, was guarded in his responses, and had not disclosed his problems to his long-term partner. While he reported some depressive symptoms, these did not meet sufficient symptoms for major depressive disorder but were nonetheless clinically significant.","Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Poor Insight, with Panic (F42.2); Other Specified Depressive Disorder (Insufficient Symptoms for MDD) (F32.89)",,brian_zaboski,,,,"**Evaluating mental health disorders**

I’m considering how to structure a coherent list of disorders. For the primary diagnosis, I'm pinpointing obsessive-compulsive disorder (F42). The secondaries I’m thinking of include other specified depressive disorder (F32.8), social anxiety disorder (F40.10), and agoraphobia (F40.00). I’m debating whether other specified anxiety disorder (F41.8) fits, given that the panic attacks might not align perfectly with the existing diagnoses. It’s complicated, as the attacks could stem from excessive rumination rather than direct social situations.

**Clarifying anxiety diagnoses**

I’m considering whether to code for ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" since his symptoms may be clinically significant but don’t fully meet social anxiety or agoraphobia criteria. There’s potential contradiction since I’ve already listed those disorders, which complicates things. Another option could be ""Panic disorder,"" but since he doesn’t experience unexpected attacks, that’s off the table. I’m thinking we can list five diagnoses, including obsessive-compulsive disorder, but I want to avoid overlapping categories and ensure I’m accurately reflecting the conditions.

**Finalizing the diagnosis list**

I'm crafting a final list of diagnoses, considering obsessive-compulsive disorder (F42), other specified depressive disorder (F32.8), social anxiety disorder (F40.10), and agoraphobia (F40.00). I did previously include ""other specified anxiety disorder"" (F41.8) for panic attacks, but now I'm pondering whether that’s too vague. The DSM allows for panic attacks as a subset in the anxiety categories, so this could work. Alternatively, there's ""unspecified anxiety disorder"" (F41.9) as a backup option.

**Clarifying anxiety disorder coding**

I'm checking the DSM-5-TR codes and see that ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" corresponds to F41.8, while ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" is F41.9. I think F41.8 is the right choice here because it captures some unspecified anxiety due to panic attacks. We're also including social anxiety and agoraphobia, which might be too much overlap. The vignette suggests the panic attacks are triggered by rumination and unemployment, which could fit into this diagnosis. However, we need a total of five codes, so I’ll keep that in mind.

**Delivering final diagnosis list**

I need to present the final diagnosis list without extra text, formatted clearly. Here’s what I’ve settled on:

1. Obsessive-compulsive disorder - F42
2. Other specified depressive disorder - F32.8
3. Social anxiety disorder (social phobia) - F40.10
4. Agoraphobia - F40.00
5. Other specified anxiety disorder - F41.8

I’ve weighed the options, and while I considered ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" (F41.9), I believe keeping ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" fits best, given there's some specific context around panic attacks.

**Finalizing the primary diagnosis**

I’m considering whether to classify the primary diagnosis as ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" or ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" given the overlap with social anxiety and agoraphobia. However, I’m leaning towards ""Other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder"" because the symptoms, while resembling OCD, don't fully meet the criteria. The individual experiences uncontrollable staring and unwanted sexual thoughts, which may count as obsessions and time-consuming behaviors. Since there's enough evidence of impairment, I’ll finalize the list without including parentheses, following the required formatting.","1. Obsessive-compulsive disorder - F42

1026,"A 32-year-old male with a past medical history of polysubstance use disorder (cocaine, marijuana, and methamphetamine) presents for bizarre behavior brought in by emergency medical services (EMS) after a neighbor called to report that patient was outside her home threatening her with a knife. Per neighbor's report, the patient had been yelling about the FBI and demanding to be let into her home while waving a knife. Patient was yelling at paramedics enroute and attempted to punch a paramedic when being loaded into the ambulance. Upon arrival to the emergency room, patient was agitated, requiring emergency intermuscular injection of medications to deescalate. Patient told doctors in the emergency room that he felt unsafe and needed them to watch his knives for him. He felt like the government was going to come get him and use the weapons in his home against him. He recalls going to the neighbor's home in an attempt to have her hide his knives for him. A few hours later, the psychiatry team came to evaluate the patient, at which point the patient appeared drowsy and asked to be left alone due to feeling tired. He refused to provide urine sample but allowed a blood draw. His blood work returned with elevated white blood count (WBC) at 18 x10e3/uL. He denied having any prior psychiatric diagnoses but admitted that he has been using methamphetamine recently. He recalls he had been admitted to an inpatient psychiatry service before, around 1 year prior after using meth, where he stayed for 3 days and was discharged on Seroquel, which patient denied currently taking. He does not recall his diagnosis from that admission. Patient agreed to receive further care at a psychiatric facility and was voluntarily transferred to an inpatient psychiatry unit. Patient was started again on Seroquel but refused to take it during admission. He was seen napping during the day and reported some stomach cramping to the treatment team. By day 3 of admission, patient reported feeling well and signed himself out of the hospital.",Other psychoactive substance abuse with psychoactive substance-induced psychotic disorder with delusions (F19.150),,ashley_huang,Substance-induced psychotic disorder,Other psychoactive substance abuse with psychoactive substance-induced psychotic disorder with delusions (F19.150),"Patient only has known history of 1 prior episode of psychosis, which appeared to be in the setting of substance use (meth). Patient this time also admitted to using meth recently. While urine sample was not obtained, an elevated WBC can be indicative of methamphetamine use in the absence of infection. Additionally, fatigue and gastrointestinal upset are common symptoms of stimulant withdrawal. Resolution of symptoms in a short course of only 3 days and without medication is another evidence for substance-induced psychosis rather than a primary psychotic disorder. However, with such limited history, an underlying primary psychotic disorder cannot be fully ruled out and thus antipsychotic treatment may still be indicated.","**Researching ICD-10 F-codes**

The user is asking for ICD-10 F-codes related to substance-induced psychotic disorder due to amphetamines. I’m thinking F15.259 might be the right choice. Looking back at DSM-5 coding, it seems F14.259 was used for cocaine-induced psychosis. I remember different codes for substance-induced disorders, where the 5th digit indicates complications. For example, F15.10 for other stimulant abuse and F15.15 for other stimulant-induced psychotic disorder. I need to double-check the accuracy of these codes.

**Identifying ICD-10 F-codes**

I need to check the ICD-10-CM codes related to stimulant abuse and psychotic disorders. There are several specific codes, like F15.120 for other stimulant abuse with uncomplicated intoxication and others for specific types of intoxication. I think F15.150 might refer to stimulant-induced psychotic disorder with delusions, but I might also use the more general F15.959 for unspecified stimulant-induced psychotic disorder. The user wants structured lists of DSM-5-TR diagnoses and corresponding ICD-10 codes, so I’m focusing on those top diagnoses.

**Cross-referencing ICD-10 Codes**

I'm working on identifying the right ICD-10 code for amphetamine-type substance-induced psychotic disorder. I think F15.259 might fit, but F15.950 has some relevance too. Alternatively, F15.959 serves as a general code for unspecified stimulant-induced psychotic disorder. In the DSM-5, I remember codes like F10.159 for alcohol-related disorders, though I'm not completely sure of those. It looks like using a less specific code could be the best route, particularly for the substance-induced psychotic disorder linked to amphetamines.

**Selecting ICD-10 Codes**

I think I can simplify this by using code F15.959 for ""Other stimulant-induced psychotic disorder, unspecified."" It's pretty widely recognized. For secondary diagnoses, I might consider coding severe stimulant use disorder, possibly using F15.20 for uncomplicated stimulant dependence, since meth falls under ""other stimulant."" The DSM-5 includes amphetamines as a type of stimulant, and since the user's history suggests polysubstance use with recent meth use, coding as F15.20 seems plausible, especially given the likelihood of severe dependence.

**Determining Codes for Diagnoses**

It looks like I can use F15.959 for ""Other stimulant-induced psychotic disorder, unspecified."" If I'm looking at stimulant use disorder, F15.20 could work, but since the user uses meth, it’s more relevant to consider F15.950, which reflects the specifics of their condition. I’ll aim for top five diagnoses and might include stimulant-induced psychotic disorder with delusions, stimulant use disorder, and possibly some variations of substance use disorders. I need to ensure I select the best codes to accurately capture the user’s situation.

**Evaluating Diagnostic Possibilities**

I need to differentiate between substance-induced and primary psychotic disorders. The user has multiple substance use issues, which gives us four diagnoses right there: meth, cocaine, and cannabis use disorders. I'm considering adding differential diagnoses like schizophrenia or brief psychotic disorder, but those might not be the best choices. It seems essential to include primary and secondary diagnoses clearly, focusing on substance-induced options, while also considering risk factors for underlying psychotic disorders, given the history of meth use and past psychiatric admissions.

**Assessing Diagnoses for Psychosis**

I see two major concerns here: acute psychotic symptoms likely induced by methamphetamine and substance use disorders. I’m considering coding it under ""Amphetamine-type substance-induced psychotic disorder with delusions."" Since we don't have a clear call on the severity of his use disorder, maybe the unspecified code is safer. Also, he shows agitation, which could indicate ""Other stimulant intoxication."" Given he has polysubstance use issues, I'll prioritize these in my top five diagnoses while ensuring they reflect the patient's situation accurately.

**Determining Appropriate Diagnoses**

I need to figure out the correct diagnoses for a case involving substance-induced psychotic disorder and intoxication. If psychotic symptoms occur during intoxication, I may not separately diagnose intoxication, but I can still specify ""with intoxication"" for use disorder. I’m outlining five diagnoses, prioritizing ""Other stimulant-induced psychotic disorder with delusions,"" and including various stimulant use disorders. I'll make sure the codes correspond correctly, considering severity and the history of the patient's substance use. It's all about accurately reflecting the situation.

**Choosing Accurate Diagnosis Codes**

I'm weighing options for coding diagnoses, particularly around stimulant-induced disorders. If I choose F15.929 for unspecified use, it seems redundant alongside F15.20. Instead, I might select F15.250, which indicates dependence. However, DSM-5-TR asks for specific codes, and I may need to go with F15.950 for psychotic disorder with delusions. For clarity and accuracy, I'm ensuring these codes align with DSM-5 guidelines while not duplicating any information. I just want to ensure everything reflects the situation appropriately!

**Selecting Diagnosis Codes**

I need to finalize diagnosis codes for stimulant use disorder. While F15.20 indicates moderate/severe dependence, I'm contemplating if I can go with F15.90 for unspecified use. Still, F15.20 might be more appropriate due to significant impairment. For cocaine and cannabis use disorders, F14.20 and F12.20 seem suitable, respectively. As for a fifth diagnosis, an unspecified schizophrenia spectrum disorder (F29) could make sense, but I might lean toward ""Other stimulant intoxication"" (F15.229) since intoxication and psychosis are likely linked here. I want to make sure I'm precise!

**Determining Diagnoses**

I’m working through the diagnoses for the patient, noting he has delusions but no hallucinations. I think that F15.929 for unspecified stimulant intoxication fits, but I have to ensure each diagnosis is unique. I already have F15.950 for psychotic disorder. So, I’m considering if I should include F15.20 for stimulant use disorder. Ultimately, I’m leaning toward F15.250 as the primary diagnosis to reflect both dependence and the psychotic disorder with delusions, ensuring it aligns with DSM-5-TR guidelines. I want to be accurate while balancing the specifics!

**Selecting Diagnoses**

I think I clearly have four diagnoses lined up: meth-induced psychosis, meth use disorder, cocaine use disorder, and cannabis use disorder. Now for the fifth, I’m contemplating “Other stimulant intoxication,” “Other stimulant withdrawal,” or “Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder.” Intoxication seems likely given the patient's agitation at admission, but I need two physical signs for confirmation. Withdrawal might apply given some symptoms, but I’m uncertain. Ultimately, I’m selecting F29 for “Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder” to complete the list!

**Finalizing Diagnoses**

For the diagnosis list, I’ll include:  
1. Stimulant-induced psychotic disorder with delusions - F15.950  
2. Stimulant (amphetamine-type) use disorder - F15.20  
3. Cocaine use disorder - F14.20  
4. Cannabis use disorder - F12.20  
5. Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder - F29  

I’ve chosen to focus on specific substances while considering the implications of the patient’s history of polysubstance use. These selections should align with the desired coding standards.

**Listing Diagnoses**

I need to present the structured list of diagnoses and corresponding F-codes without any additional text. Here’s what I’ll include:

1. Other stimulant-induced psychotic disorder, with delusions (methamphetamine-induced) - F15.950  
2. Stimulant (amphetamine-type) use disorder - F15.20  
3. Cocaine use disorder - F14.20

She also reports that he told her he feels unsafe because people are trying to harm him. She also noticed that he has been more irritable, occasionally punching walls but never people. When patient was interviewed directly, he appeared constricted and dysphoric, with hair covering his eyes. He spoke softly.

However, since it appears that the depressive symptoms appeared first (several months ago) with the psychotic features appearing later on with the severity of depression (more recently, new-onset), the diagnosis would be MDD with psychosis rather than a primary psychotic disorder such as schizoaffective disorder. The patient also has demonstrated cannabis use and Xanax dependency.","**Clarifying ICD-10 F-codes**

I’m trying to figure out the user's request for ICD-10 F-codes. There’s F12.5, but that’s not the same as ICD-10-CM. DSM-5 refers to ICD-10-CM codes. The user specified F-codes, so I should stick with those that match DSM diagnoses. For instance, I recall F12.959 is for cannabis use with psychotic disorder unspecified, and F12.259 is for cannabis dependence. I’m thinking we should clarify the specifics regarding the user’s cannabis use.

**Assessing cannabis-related diagnosis**

The user indicates that marijuana is used to treat paranoia, which leads me to consider cannabis use disorder, possibly F12.90 for unspecified disorder. Although mild cannabis use disorder could be F12.10, I have to note that moderate/severe is F12.20. If psychosis is induced, F12.159 might apply. To diagnose cannabis-induced psychotic disorder, we need clear evidence linking psychosis to marijuana use, not just a positive test. His use has increased, but that doesn't definitively link to his psychosis. He's shown improvement with antipsychotics, but we can't be certain it's substance-induced.

**Exploring psychotic disorder options**

I'm considering various diagnoses, like brief psychotic disorder (F23) or schizophreniform disorder (F20.81), but we need symptom duration to determine those. Without knowing how long symptoms have persisted, it complicates matters. The user’s marijuana use has increased recently, which plays a role too. I might also look at unspecified schizophrenia spectrum disorder (F29) since his symptoms don't entirely meet other criteria. He's experiencing persecutory delusions and perceptual disturbances. There are also indicators of depression, anxiety, and possible trauma, but I need more detailed descriptions to understand if it's PTSD.

**Assessing mental health diagnoses**

I’m examining the user's non-suicidal self-injury, which isn’t a formal DSM-5 diagnosis but is noted in ICD-10. The DSM-5 does mention it as a condition for further study, so that’s worth considering. I might also look at an unspecified disorder or other specified trauma-related disorder. Then there’s the potential for benzodiazepine use disorder – it's hard to specify without details. For major depressive disorder, options include moderate or severe, potentially with psychotic features, given his symptoms, especially since he’s shown improvement with treatment.

**Determining top psychiatric diagnoses**

I need to identify the five most likely diagnoses given the user’s symptoms. Potential primary diagnoses include major depressive disorder with psychotic features, cannabis-induced psychotic disorder, and unspecified psychotic disorder. The user experiences depression alongside paranoia and substance use, and his symptoms are complicated. Since his paranoia worsened with marijuana use, it’s unclear if the cannabis is the primary cause or if there's an underlying psychotic disorder. I might consider unspecified schizophrenia spectrum disorder due to limited information. His visual distortions and depressive symptoms need to be part of my final structured list of diagnoses.

**Identifying psychiatric disorders**

I need to define the top five likely diagnoses based on the user's situation. Key possibilities include ""Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder,"" ""Major depressive disorder, single episode,"" ""Cannabis use disorder,"" and ""Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder."" Considering the user's substance use, particularly with Xanax and cannabis, it's vital to account for their histories. Also, the user's depressive symptoms may be moderate to severe and could influence my primary diagnosis of either MDD or a psychotic disorder. I want to ensure that any chosen diagnosis aligns accurately with DSM-5 criteria.

**Determining diagnoses and codes**

I'm trying to pinpoint the appropriate diagnostic codes for the user's case, focusing on cannabis-related disorders and their ties to their symptoms. Primarily, I’m considering ""Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder"" since they report psychotic features. For cannabis use, I want to assign either F12.10 or F12.20, but I’m torn over specifying severity since I don’t have all the details. I also need to include major depressive disorder and possible anxiety disorders, ensuring that I accurately reflect the user’s condition while following DSM-5 guidelines.

**Structuring diagnoses and codes**

I'm working through how to structure the diagnoses for the user’s case. It seems they want a set list of the top five DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses, including the primary and four secondary ones. There's a bit of ambiguity in whether to focus on comorbidities or differential diagnoses, but it seems appropriate to include both. I plan to incorporate major depressive disorder, cannabis-induced psychotic disorder, and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum as potential diagnoses. The challenge lies in specifying the exact F-codes accurately.

**Finalizing diagnostic list**

I'm drafting a structured list of the top five psychiatric diagnoses for the user's case. I think we should include ""Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder"" and potentially ""Major depressive disorder"" as possible diagnoses. For the top five, I’ll likely include unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder too. It's tricky since they also want reasons to support each code. I'll need to ensure I choose the correct ICD-10 codes while considering the patient's symptoms, like depression and psychosis.

**Determining primary diagnosis**

For the top diagnoses, I’m focusing on this case of a 16-year-old male with depression and psychotic symptoms linked to cannabis use and possible benzodiazepine effects. I’m leaning towards making ""Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder (cannabis-induced)"" the primary diagnosis, since his paranoia aligns with recent cannabis use. I’ll also include ""Major depressive disorder with psychotic features"" as a possibility. I need to list these in terms of likelihood and ensure they all have corresponding F-codes, following the guidelines provided.

**Assessing primary diagnosis**

I'm considering whether to choose ""Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe, with psychotic features"" as the primary diagnosis since he displays both depressive symptoms and psychosis. However, his psychosis may be substance-induced due to recent cannabis use for paranoia. The timeline suggests his psychotic symptoms appeared before increased cannabis use, indicating he could be self-medicating. I need to finalize a list of five most likely diagnoses, prioritizing unspecified psychotic disorder, cannabis-induced psychotic disorder, and major depressive disorder, while ensuring I include appropriate F-codes.

**Deciding on diagnoses**

I’m considering whether to choose ""Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder with delusions,"" but the symptoms may vary. He has delusions and visual distortions, perhaps hallucinations, so I may categorize it as ""with hallucinations"" using code F12.951 or go with unspecified F12.959 to keep it broad. 

Then there’s ""Cannabis use disorder."" Since he uses marijuana frequently to cope, I might lean towards F12.20 for moderate or severe usage. For ""Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder,"" I might also pick F13.20 due to long-time use. 

Additionally, we can explore ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" and evaluate the impact of abuse which might suggest PTSD or related disorders. Ultimately, I need to select five precise diagnoses, including potential overlaps like depression and psychosis.

**Choosing the top diagnoses**

I'm weighing the options for the primary diagnosis, considering ""Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features."" I think he might also fit into ""cannabis-induced psychotic disorder"" and ""schizophreniform disorder."" I need five diagnoses. Clearly, he shows signs of psychosis, depression, cannabis use disorder, and possibly a sedative use disorder. 

Maybe the last option could be ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" or an ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder."" I need to ensure the top five are well-structured and appropriate, so let's finalize that list!

**Clarifying diagnoses and codes**

I'm analyzing the situation: the patient uses cannabis, shows signs of psychosis, and there's been some improvement over a week. I see possible cannabis-induced psychotic disorder given the timeframe and his history of Xanax use. 

For the primary diagnosis, I think ""Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder"" (F12.959) fits best. Then for secondary options, I could go with ""Major depressive disorder"" (F32.2), and perhaps add ""Schizophreniform disorder"" (F20.81) and ""Cannabis use disorder"" (F12.20). 

Finally, I should consider ""Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder"" (F13.20). Choosing these F-codes is important to accurately capture his situation!

**Refining diagnoses for patient**

I'm evaluating the patient, a 16-year-old male presenting with psychotic symptoms and a history of cannabis and Xanax use. It seems he might fit ""Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder"" (F12.959) as the primary diagnosis. 

For the secondary diagnoses, I think ""Major depressive disorder"" (F32.2), ""Schizophreniform disorder"" (F20.81), and both ""Cannabis use disorder"" (F12.20) and ""Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder"" (F13.20) are relevant. 

I need to ensure there are no duplicates or unnecessary entries in this list.

**Deciding on diagnoses**

I’m evaluating the potential diagnoses, considering ""Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder"" as primary, with ""Major depressive disorder"" and substance-related disorders as secondary options. ""Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder"" is also a differential diagnosis.

Given the patient’s cannabis use and symptoms improving with treatment, I might lean toward ""Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder"" as primary. My final list would ideally be:  
1. Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder - F12.959  
2. Major depressive disorder - F32.2  
3. Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum - F29  
4. Cannabis use disorder - F12.20  
5. Sedative use disorder - F13.20

**Analyzing cannabis use and diagnoses**

I'm considering the patient's cannabis use and the appropriate diagnostic codes. Although there aren't enough criteria for a clear use disorder, I could state ""Other cannabis-related disorder"" and use code F12.90. Yet, I might lean on ""Cannabis use disorder, severity unspecified (provisional)"" instead. 

It seems the patient likely has problematic use due to evasiveness, and it's appropriate to include differentials. I’ll settle on a final list that includes ""Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum"" as primary and ""Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder"" as a secondary option. This approach feels both cautious and precise.

**Determining diagnoses and severity**

I’m weighing different diagnoses for the patient, including ""Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)"" and various substance use disorders. He exhibits symptoms like low mood, sleep disturbances, and self-harm, suggesting he meets MDD criteria—perhaps even severe, given his suicidal ideation and access to guns.

For substance use, I’m considering “Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder.” However, the specifics on severity are unclear, so I'll likely categorize them as unspecified. I need to make sure the diagnoses align with DSM-5-TR guidelines and focus on what’s most relevant.

**Finalizing diagnoses and codes**

I’m evaluating primary diagnoses for the patient, leaning towards ""Brief psychotic disorder"" since symptoms improved quickly, but without clear duration, I'll consider ""Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder"" as safer. I also need to ensure correct ICD-10 codes are applied. 

The final list could include:  
1. Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum - F29   
2. Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe - F32.2  
3. Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder - F12.959  
4. Cannabis use disorder - F12.20  
5. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder - F13.20  

I must remember to keep the reasoning internal as I finalize this.

**Finalizing psychiatric diagnoses**

I’m confirming the codes and diagnoses for the patient's condition. The final list is as follows:

1. Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder - F29  
2. Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe without psychotic features - F32.2  
3. Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder - F12.959  
4. Cannabis use disorder - F12.20  
5. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder (alprazolam) - F13.20

1028,"A 14-year-old male patient with a history of generalized anxiety disorder is brought to his pediatrician for a skin exam after she saw the patient wiping his skin down with a Clorox wipe. She reports that since the start of COVID in 2020, patient has been more vigilant about keeping his space and belongings clean, wiping down his devices upon returning from any outing, wiping down doorknobs, light switches, and bathroom counters daily. She states that initially, he feared catching COVID. However, she states it has been 3 years of such behaviors and believes that his cleaning behaviors have actually intensified. She noticed that he started washing his hands more often, sometimes showering multiple times in a day, and last week, saw him use a Clorox disinfecting wipe to clean his body. She became concerned for the potential of chemical irritation on his skin. When patient was addressed directly, patient reports that he needs everything to be clean. He expresses an intense fear that his belongings and space are contaminated with germs if he does not clean then regularly. He alludes to his view of the outside as “dirty” and that his room is “clean.” He feels the intense urge to have anything that enters his room to be decontaminated otherwise his whole room will become contaminated. He describes an intense feeling of anxiety if he cannot clean things before they enter his room. He states that he spends a lot of time washing his hands because if he misses a spot or brushes his hand against the side of the sink, he needs to start over to ensure that they are fully clean. He endorses similar patterns with showering and wiping down belongings, often needing to start over to ensure he did not miss any spots and has fully decontaminated. He does mention that he has been struggling in school due to having less time to study with his cleaning obligations.",Obsessive-compulsive disorder (F42),,ashley_huang,Obsessive-compulsive disorder,Obsessive-compulsive disorder (F42),,"**Considering differential diagnoses**

I’m checking through secondary differential diagnoses. Some are less likely but still plausible, like ""Generalized anxiety disorder,"" which I can list because it's in the history. I wonder if I could include ""Other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder,"" though symptoms likely meet full criteria. I also need four secondary diagnoses, such as ""Obsessive-compulsive personality traits,"" but that requires a distinct pattern not present here. Additionally, I could consider ""Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder"" or ""Delusional disorder, somatic type,"" but the latter seems quite unlikely.

**Assessing secondary diagnoses**

I’m considering including ""Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder,"" but there's no psychosis. I think about ""Specific learning disorder,"" but the struggles seem more related to time management rather than cognitive deficits, so I’ll skip that. Hoarding disorder doesn’t fit either. I wonder about other options like ""Obsessive-compulsive disorder"" and ""Excoriation disorder,"" but I’m not convinced. I might lean toward identifying specific phobias, particularly related to contamination, while verifying these ICD codes like F40.298. There’s a lot to balance here!

**Clarifying codes and disorders**

I'm diving into the subcodes for specific phobias like F40.218 for animal types and F40.298 for other types—wait, that one fits! Then, I consider illness anxiety disorder at F45.21 and obsessives like F60.5 or even F84.0 for autism spectrum disorder, but they don’t seem right here. I also check on ""Other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder,"" which seems to line up with F42.8 in ICD-10. So, I need to clarify these DSM-5 and ICD-10 codes to ensure I’m accurate—so much to keep track of!

**Organizing diagnostic options**

I’m thinking about ""Other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder,"" which maps to F42.8, but listing both that and OCD seems redundant. I could go with ""Obsessive-compulsive disorder (contamination type; with good/fair insight)"" as the primary diagnosis. Then I'd follow with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and consider other options. While I can list ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" as a differential, it feels less relevant since the patient has GAD. I want to ensure my differentials are plausible but still supported by the information I have!

**Finalizing potential diagnoses**

I'm reviewing potential diagnoses for this 14-year-old male with a history of generalized anxiety disorder. The primary diagnosis could be ""Obsessive-compulsive disorder,"" while secondary options may include ""Generalized anxiety disorder,"" ""Specific phobia"" (contamination), ""Illness anxiety disorder,"" and ""Unspecified anxiety disorder."" However, I'm also considering other specified obsessive-compulsive related disorders based on his compulsive cleaning behaviors. While some options like OCPD or ASD feel less plausible, they may still serve as differentials. I want to ensure each diagnosis is relevant and appears plausible based on the available information!

**Assessing potential diagnoses**

I'm analyzing the symptoms of a 14-year-old who feels intense anxiety about cleanliness and contamination. His compulsions, like excessive handwashing and cleaning rituals, align well with Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). While I also see potential for diagnoses like Generalized anxiety disorder and Specific phobia (germs), these are less supported. Illness anxiety disorder might not fit, as it requires different criteria. I need to list the top diagnoses, ensuring they’re plausible based solely on the information provided. I want to be precise and relevant!

**Finalizing possible diagnoses**

I'm considering a list of potential diagnoses for a case involving anxiety and cleanliness, based on the symptoms presented. The primary diagnosis seems to be Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), with Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) as a secondary option. Other possibilities include Specific phobia related to germs, Illness anxiety disorder, and Adjustment disorder with anxiety, though I have doubts about the latter due to persistent symptoms. I need to ensure each suggestion is justifiable based on the provided information without fabrication. It's a bit of a balancing act here!

**Establishing possible diagnoses**

I'm considering various diagnoses based on symptomatology. The primary diagnosis looks to be Obsessive-compulsive disorder (specifically mixed obsessional thoughts and acts, F42.2), with Generalized anxiety disorder (F41.1) as a secondary. Possible inclusions might be Specific phobia related to germs (F40.298), Illness anxiety disorder (F45.21), and Adjustment disorder with anxiety (F43.22). However, I’m weighing how well each fits the symptoms, especially given the ongoing nature of the pandemic impacting mental health.

**Selecting top diagnoses**

I'm navigating the complexities of determining the top five psychiatric diagnoses here. My primary choice is Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD, F42.2), followed by Generalized anxiety disorder (F41.1) in a secondary position due to the patient's history. Specific phobia related to contamination (F40.298) and Illness anxiety disorder (F45.21) also seem relevant. For the fifth spot, I’m leaning towards Adjustment disorder with anxiety (F43.22) based on recent context, though consideration of other specified obsessive-compulsive disorders could also fit.

**Determining potential diagnoses**

I'm analyzing the patient's history and behaviors related to OCD and anxiety. The symptoms started around the time of COVID, but they persisted longer than expected. I’m considering “Adjustment disorder” as a potential diagnosis, though OCD seems more fitting due to the compulsions. 

For my top five diagnoses, I’ll include OCD as primary, followed by Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Specific Phobia, Illness Anxiety Disorder, and possibly “Other specified anxiety disorder” as a way to account for health-related concerns.

**Finalizing diagnoses list**

I’m listing the top five likely diagnoses according to DSM-5-TR for the patient's symptoms. Primary will be Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), with a code of F42.2. Following that, I'll include Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1), Specific Phobia (F40.298), Illness Anxiety Disorder (F45.21), and Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety (F43.22). I want to ensure these are relevant and that I include only psychiatric diagnoses with corresponding F-codes, keeping it clear and straightforward without additional reasoning.","1.

1029,"Patient is a 23-year-old male patient with a past psychiatric history of anxiety and depression who is hospitalized for a suicide attempt 2 days ago during a fight with his girlfriend. He reports that he took a handful of pills (escitalopram) that he has prescribed for anxiety. He reports that 2 days ago, his girlfriend was angry at him and suggested that she was thinking about leaving the relationship. The patient reports that he felt very hurt and wanted to show her how much he was hurt by her statement, which is why he took the pills. He described the act as impulsive and wasn’t sure if he truly wanted to die in the moment. He states that he does not regret his decision but also denies any suicidal ideation (SI) currently. He also denies feeling depressed prior to the fight. He states that his friends and loved ones “always” leave him and that he was hurt because he thought his girlfriend was different. When asked about outpatient care, he expressed a mistrust for mental health providers, stating that most of them “just don’t get it” and that he is still working on finding a therapist who understands him. He says that the last clinic assigned him a female provider even though he requested a male provider. He admits that they stated they didn’t have any male providers available at the time, but still feels that they betrayed him by making him false promises.

This suicide attempt is not secondary to major depressive disorder (MDD) as he does not have the criteria for MDD of >2 weeks of low/depressed mood or anhedonia.","**Establishing diagnostic possibilities**

I’m listing potential diagnoses with their corresponding ICD-10 codes. The top five include borderline personality disorder, unspecified depressive disorder, unspecified anxiety disorder, adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, and paranoid personality disorder. 

I wonder if the depressed mood should be viewed as more reactive and chronic instead of full depressive disorder. There's also the option of saying ""Persistent depressive disorder,"" but it seems uncertain. I need to ensure these codes are accurate and relevant for the conditions presented.

**Considering possible diagnoses**

I'm thinking about listing ""Other specified personality disorder"" as a potential fifth diagnosis if there's uncertainty about borderline personality disorder, but I'm not leaning toward that option. 

Maybe ""Other specified bipolar and related disorder"" fits, focusing on mood swings rather than mania. However, I’m thinking about cyclothymic disorder, though that doesn't seem right either. Given the request for the top five diagnoses with corresponding codes, I need to ensure my final answer reflects the best possible options. I'll structure the list clearly to focus on the most accurate diagnoses.

**Diagnosing possibilities**

I'm exploring the user's symptoms, which involve mood swings and difficulties with friendships. The mania screen is negative, and there aren't any early signs of autism. Key patterns here include interpersonal sensitivity, fears of abandonment, impulsive self-harm, and chronic dysphoria. 

I think borderline personality disorder (BPD) could be a strong candidate. Other options could be major depressive disorder or adjustment disorder, but he doesn't endorse typical symptoms for those. I'm also considering generalized anxiety disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder, but I want to confirm if BPD truly fits.

**Assessing BPD criteria**

I’m looking at the DSM-5-TR criteria for borderline personality disorder (BPD), which requires a pervasive pattern of instability starting in early adulthood, indicated by five or more of the nine criteria. 

First, we have frantic efforts to avoid abandonment — that seems to be present due to his impulsive overdose related to a girlfriend leaving. Next, there's a potential pattern of unstable relationships. However, identity disturbance and impulsivity in self-damaging areas don’t seem to be applicable. His recurrent suicidal behavior and affective instability do align with the criteria. So, I’m thinking BPD might indeed fit.

**Finalizing diagnostic list**

I'm working through potential diagnoses and considering ""Other specified personality disorder"" if the individual doesn't meet full BPD criteria. However, I’m leaning towards keeping BPD as the primary diagnosis. 

I could include ""Major depressive disorder"" or ""Persistent depressive disorder,"" but it’s tricky since there’s a history of depression. I need to balance my choices carefully. 

Ultimately, the final list should be: Borderline personality disorder, unspecified depressive disorder, unspecified anxiety disorder, adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, and possibly ""Paranoid personality disorder."" But, I’m curious if there’s a stronger fit for the fifth option.

**Choosing primary diagnoses**

I’m sorting out the top five diagnoses for the user’s case. The primary one likely is Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), given the criteria we’ve assessed. Next, I’m considering an adjustment disorder due to significant stress from a suicide attempt, which fits well. 

For depression, I’m torn between unspecified depressive disorder and major depressive disorder. Generalized anxiety disorder could be next, but it’s a bit uncertain there. Lastly, I'm pondering the validity of including paranoid personality disorder. All must align with valid F-codes, though I worry about justifying paranoid features fully. I’ll weigh the pros and cons carefully!

**Finalizing diagnoses list**

I’m pinning down the top five diagnoses. For the primary, we're looking at Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), which fits based on the criteria we clarified. For secondary diagnoses, I’m considering:

1. Major Depressive Disorder (recurrent, unspecified) - F32.A
2. Generalized Anxiety Disorder - F41.9
3. Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood - F43.23
4. Other Specified Personality Disorder (paranoid traits) - F60.89

I need to make sure everything aligns correctly. It feels like these accurately represent the complexities presented!

**Finalizing diagnosis considerations**

I’m deciding on diagnoses for this case. I’m leaning towards ""Other Specified Personality Disorder"" (F60.89) to cover borderline traits while considering if fifth should be ""Dependent Personality Disorder"" (F60.7) or ""Paranoid Personality Disorder"" (F60.0). Paranoid traits appear but don’t fully meet criteria. Generalized anxiety and unspecified depressive disorders are options, but evidence isn't strong. For fifth, I’m also thinking about including Major Depressive Disorder (F33.41) to acknowledge his past and current mild symptoms. Ultimately, I aim to ensure all diagnoses support his needs effectively.

**Refining diagnosis choices**

I'm analyzing the best diagnoses for this patient. I’m thinking about whether to include ""Other Specified Personality Disorder"" (F60.89) to capture any mixed traits, but it feels redundant since Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is already primary. I’m considering other options for the fifth diagnosis, like ""Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, in Partial Remission"" (F33.41) since he has a past history of depression and currently acknowledges depressive feelings. Ultimately, I’m working to finalize a coherent list of five diagnoses that are plausible and not too speculative for accurate representation.

**Clarifying personality disorders**

I'm contemplating the best diagnosis options for the patient. I'm leaning towards ""Other Specified Personality Disorder"" (F60.89) to represent any mixed traits, especially alongside Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). I’m trying to ensure that any additional complexities are captured without redundancy. Evaluating the criteria for BPD, I see that the patient meets enough criteria to support this diagnosis. But I’m still trying to figure out the fifth diagnosis, considering options like ""Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent"" or sticking with ""Other Specified Personality Disorder"" to acknowledge potential nuances.

**Deciding on diagnoses**

I'm working on finalizing the top five diagnoses for the patient. Currently, I have Borderline Personality Disorder (F60.3) and am considering the inclusion of Other Specified Depressive Disorder (F32.8) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1). Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood (F43.23) is also under consideration. I’m trying to ensure none of these overlap or conflict. It seems best to stick with diagnoses that reflect the patient's current situation while avoiding redundant disorders. Let's finalize the list clearly.

**Finalizing diagnoses list**

I’m finalizing the list of diagnoses to include: Borderline Personality Disorder (F60.3) as the primary diagnosis. For the secondary diagnoses, I’m considering Unspecified Depressive Disorder (F32.A), Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9), and Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood (F43.23). I'm contemplating Paranoid Personality Disorder (F60.0) or possibly Dependent Personality Disorder, but it seems Paranoid PD fits better as the fifth option. I want to ensure the list reflects the most likely conditions accurately.

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

I've confirmed the diagnoses I want to include. The primary diagnosis is Borderline Personality Disorder (F60.3), followed by Unspecified Depressive Disorder (F32.A), Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9), Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood (F43.23), and Paranoid Personality Disorder (F60.0).

1030,"Patient is a 31-year-old female denying any psychiatric history who was transferred to the county psychiatry hospital from a local emergency room for threatening to kill herself. She tells the evaluating psychiatrist that she had gotten into an argument with her husband. She states that she and her husband has been living in a hotel for the past week due to a conflict between her and her mother-in-law. She reports that she feels her husband does not understand nor respect her because he was requesting to return home to be closer to his workplace. She states that she was surprised at the argument because he is usually a “good man.” When asked what made her feel disrespected this time, she replied it was because he was refusing her request to continue staying at the hotel and that he usually never says no to her. When asked her reason for staying, she stated that she just “did not feel ready” to return home yet because being around her mother-in-law stressed her out. She did not understand why her husband was not accommodating her discomfort. However, when pointing out husband’s discomfort with the long commute time to work, she minimized his concern and did not acknowledge his struggle, instead redirecting the conversation to her own feelings. When asked about the reason for her disagreement with her mother-in-law, she states it is because her mother-in-law does not recognize her efforts for contributing to the household. She states that, “My mother-in-law always complains that I don’t do chores and don’t work. But she doesn’t get it that I’m the one supporting my husband at his job and that he should be the main breadwinner anyways as the husband. Besides, I did the dishes today, it’s not even true that I don’t do chores.” When addressing the physicians, she addresses them casually (e.g. “dude,” “man,” etc.) and states to them, “You’re a doctor, you should be smart enough to understand me.” She denies that she has any mental issues that requires her to remain in the hospital, stating that, “Smart people like us, we get misunderstood, you get it right? That’s why they sent me here.” She also alludes to believing that her mother-in-law called the police to have her brought here to get her away from her husband because she’s “jealous I get to spend more time with her son than she does.” When informing her that the reason for her hospitalization was the threat of suicide, she casually waves it off, stating, “Oh, I don’t actually want to kill myself, I just said that to get my husband to listen to me.”",Narcissistic personality disorder (F60.81),,ashley_huang,Narcissistic personality disorder,Narcissistic personality disorder (F60.81),"Patient demonstrates an expectation to be recognized as superior (like with her mother-in-law), feeling that they are special and can only be understood by smart people like doctors, exploitative behaviors of expecting her husband to go along with her every demand and attempting to manipulate him via suicidal threats when he does not comply, a lack of empathy towards her husband, and believing that her mother-in-law is envious of her. These traits are key features for narcissistic personality disorder.","**Selecting diagnoses**

I need to choose the top five diagnoses. My list includes narcissistic personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct, histrionic personality disorder, and perhaps an ""other specified personality disorder."" But there’s a pitfall; including both histrionic might be redundant. It might be clearer to focus on distinct, plausible conditions, like paranoid personality disorder instead of repeating traits. I’ll refine my differential from there!

**Evaluating diagnoses**

I’m working on identifying the right diagnosis. Initially, I thought of Bipolar I disorder for a manic episode, but upon further inspection, the signs of mania aren’t present—there's no elevated mood or increased activity. Delusional disorder seems unlikely too; her perspective on family dynamics doesn’t clearly point to paranoia. So, it looks like I might have to consider personality disorders instead, with the option to include ""Unspecified personality disorder"" if there aren't enough specific criteria. This needs careful thought!

**Choosing the right diagnosis**

I’m aiming for a ""Level 5"" in reasoning, although I can't show my thought process outright. For the diagnosis, perhaps ""Other specified personality disorder"" indicating prominent narcissistic traits could be primary, since there’s not enough evidence for a long-standing pattern. However, the vignette tends to suggest Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) with its classic traits like entitlement and grandiosity. While it’s critical not to overdiagnose, I think I can justify choosing NPD based on the symptoms presented and her age—it's possibly indicative of a cluster B personality.

**Finalizing diagnoses**

I’m considering that while ""Borderline Personality Disorder"" could be a primary option due to suicidal threats, the features of Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) seem to dominate. She appears more arrogant than emotionally unstable and lacks classic symptoms like self-harm or chronic emptiness. NPD feels more fitting here. Now, I need to include four plausible secondary diagnoses. I’m thinking of adding ""Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Disturbance of Emotions and Conduct"" and potentially other cluster B disorders. I’ll finalize my top five soon.

2. Borderline personality disorder - F60.3

His parents say that he has never had any psychiatric diagnoses before, and they didn’t think anyone in the family has any problems either. He has a good number of friends and doesn’t struggle socially. At home, mom reports that he does like to do active things like play tag, ride his bike, and learn how to play soccer. In clinic, he gets up frequently to look at things in the office, playing with hand sanitizer dispenser, and tries to get mom’s attention when the psychiatrist is speaking with her.",Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (F90.9),,ashley_huang,Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder,Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (F90.9),,"**Evaluating behavior traits**

I’m considering a few behaviors here: someone who leaves their seat, talks excessively, interrupts, or fidgets. It seems like they might have difficulty remaining seated or waiting for their turn. I can't be sure if it strictly relates to the number 6, but it could be interpreted as needing at least that many traits. It’s interesting to think about how these behaviors impact interactions!

**Mapping hyperactivity symptoms**

I’m carefully considering hyperactivity symptoms from the DSM. Here’s what I’ve got: Fidgeting with hands or feet, often leaving the seat, and possibly being loud during activities. There’s mention of being “on the go,” along with excessive talking, which could also fit. Impulsivity comes into play with interrupting others, but a few parts are uncertain, like difficulty waiting turns. If we interpret these traits, we could count around six symptoms, but I’m not entirely sure!

**Considering ADHD diagnosis**

I’m looking at a situation where the symptoms have lasted for only 5 months, but the criteria require 6 months for a full ADHD diagnosis. So, I can't just assume the symptoms existed before school. In clinical practice, we might diagnose based on likelihood, but since the question insists on accuracy, ""Other specified ADHD"" seems appropriate due to the insufficient duration. Although I could consider other diagnoses, like ""ADHD, predominantly hyperactive/impulsive presentation,"" I think sticking with ""Other specified ADHD"" is best for now.

**Identifying possible diagnoses**

The question asks for the top 5 most likely diagnoses, with ADHD as a primary option, even though the duration might not fully meet the criteria. The case describes a 6-year-old who just started kindergarten 5 months ago. This could be context, as symptoms might have been present earlier but unnoticed by parents. Since there’s no explicit mention of when symptoms began, we can assume they started around kindergarten. So I think listing ADHD makes sense, despite being slightly under 6 months.

**Determining primary and secondary diagnoses**

In this case, the DSM criteria state that symptoms must last at least 6 months for ADHD, but here we see 5 months, which is close. The details suggest ADHD as the primary diagnosis, particularly ""ADHD, predominantly hyperactive/impulsive presentation"" (F90.1). Other secondary options could include ""Other specified ADHD"" (F90.8), ""Adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct"" (F43.24), and ""Oppositional defiant disorder"" (F91.3), among others. It's crucial to focus on what fits best based on the provided context and observed behaviors.

**Finalizing possible diagnoses**

In this analysis, I need to clarify the top diagnoses based on the symptoms observed. ADHD, predominantly hyperactive/impulsive presentation (F90.1) seems to fit best as the primary diagnosis. For secondary options, I might list ADHD, combined presentation (F90.2), adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct (F43.24), oppositional defiant disorder (F91.3), and other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder (F91.8). It's essential to ensure these reflect plausible comorbidities while adhering to guidelines about duration and symptom recognition.

**Assessing ADHD diagnosis**

I've got a timeline of 5 months to consider, so it may not fully meet the duration required for diagnosing ADHD. I might consider ""Other specified attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder"" (F90.8) as the primary diagnosis due to insufficient duration. For secondary options, I could include ADHD, predominantly hyperactive/impulsive (F90.1), adjustment disorder (F43.24), oppositional defiant disorder (F91.3), or unspecified disruptive behavior disorder (F91.9). While ADHD is likely, I need to be careful and accurate in assessments based on the criteria.

**Determining ADHD diagnoses**

I’m considering using the ""provisional"" specifier for ADHD since full criteria can't be confirmed, but symptoms seem present. I'll list ""Other specified attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder"" (F90.8) as the primary diagnosis because of insufficient duration. Other possible diagnoses include ADHD, predominantly hyperactive/impulsive (F90.1), oppositional defiant disorder (F91.3), adjustment disorder (F43.24), and unspecified disruptive behaviour (F91.9). I realize that while diagnosis should be precise, including ""provisional"" is tapering on the guidelines, but could be informative. Let’s finalize this structured list!

**Choosing secondary diagnoses**

I need to compile a list of secondaries for the primary diagnosis. I’m considering ADHD hyperactive/impulsive (F90.1) and combined presentation (F90.2), along with oppositional defiant disorder (F91.3) and adjustment disorder (F43.24). Although it's tempting to make the top five mostly ADHD related, I need to ensure variety. Ultimately, I'll finalize my recommendations, leading with ""Other specified ADHD"" (F90.8) as primary and incorporating ODD and adjustment disorder to fill out the list accurately based on the provided information.

**Finalizing ADHD diagnoses**

I'm deciding to use ""Other specified ADHD"" as the primary, considering limited duration information. It’s crucial to pair it with appropriate secondary diagnoses. So, I’ll determine other likely conditions like oppositional defiant disorder and adjustment disorder. Ultimately, I want a structured list, ensuring the codes match correctly. My final list will comprise ""Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, predominantly hyperactive/impulsive presentation,"" ""Other specified ADHD,"" ""Oppositional defiant disorder,"" ""Adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct,"" and ""Unspecified attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder."" This keeps the focus clear without excessive differentiation.

**Choosing ADHD diagnoses**

I'm settling on ""Other specified ADHD"" as primary since there's insufficient duration info. For the secondary conditions, I’m considering ""Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, predominantly hyperactive/impulsive presentation,"" ""Oppositional defiant disorder,"" ""Adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct,"" and ""Other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder."" My final list keeps the top five plausible diagnoses, even if it includes duplicates of ADHD presentations, but they reflect different specifications. This way, I ensure we're thorough without straying too far from what's likely based on the available information.","1.

1032,"Patient is a 10-year-old female who is brought into the walk-in area of a psychiatric hospital for hitting kids at school. The patient is a ward of the state, both of her parents were found to be unfit to care for the child. The guardian received a report from her teacher that the patient slapped a classmate during an argument. The patient is in the 5th grade. She has had many other reports this year for throwing tantrums and getting into fights. Guardian reports that patient has a history of being returned from various foster and adoptive families due to anger and aggression. She states that since the patient has been under her care, she has noticed the patient to be easily irritable with little to no accountability for her own actions, blaming the other kids for annoying her or saying that “I didn’t mean it.” Aggressive outbursts occur multiple times a week. When asked, the patient says that other kids annoy her but is unable to specify examples. She also says that staff and teachers annoy her too. However, she denies hitting them. The patient during the assessment repeated interrupts the guardian and the evaluator saying, “I didn’t do anything,” and begging to be taken home. As guardian shares reports made by the school, the patient interrupts and calls guardian a “liar” and is visibly upset. Patient begs the evaluator to let her go home and not recommend hospitalization. However, when evaluator informed patient that aggression is often a reason for admission, patient suddenly becomes very angry, picking up a tissues box and throwing it at the glass divider between her and the evaluator. When evaluator pointed out her behavior, patient immediately becomes tearful and apologetic, stating,” I didn’t do anything, I didn’t mean it, I didn’t even hit you.” Guardian states that behaviors like this is what she is referring to. Guardian reports that her outbursts are most common when she doesn’t get her way, but that she seems to be irritable in general as well.",Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (F34.81),,ashley_huang,Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD),Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (F34.81),The patient has outbursts that demonstrate poor emotional regulation. She is described as irritable even between outbursts and symptoms started before the age of 10. She has multiple episodes per week. Her outbursts are against both authority figures and peers which makes diagnosis DMDD rather than ODD.,"**Evaluating diagnosis options**

I'm considering diagnoses like ODD and DMDD. If outbursts are severe and frequent, DMDD seems relevant, especially with the focus on irritability. The mention of events happening ""this year"" suggests they could extend beyond six months. DMDD could be a primary diagnosis for a 10-year-old alongside Conduct Disorder if there are repeated fights, but I’m unsure if there’s enough evidence for that. I need to think about the specific F-codes for these conditions too.

**Clarifying diagnosis codes**

I'm sorting through various diagnosis codes like F91.1 for Conduct Disorder (childhood-onset) and the distinctions in ICD-10. I notice that DSM specifies things differently. DMDD has code F34.81, while ODD is F91.3. There's also ADHD to consider, but it might not fit the case fully. I think about several potential conditions, including ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" F41.9, but that might not apply. I need to ensure I'm considering all options accurately!

**Assessing potential diagnoses**

I’m considering possible top diagnoses and think about the term ""Disruptive Behavior Disorder."" I want to prioritize DMDD as the main diagnosis alongside ODD. DMDD fits well since it’s for kids with frequent outbursts and irritability—just like the vignette describes. The 10-year-old has multiple weekly outbursts and an irritable mood that shows symptoms in at least two settings. Although the duration isn’t clear, there are hints at a long-standing pattern from the guardian’s reports. That gives me a strong basis for DMDD!

**Determining chronic conditions**

I’m working through the assumption that the behavior issues have been chronic, particularly given the history of being returned by various foster and adoptive families, hinting it could be ongoing for more than a year. DMDD seems appropriate based on the symptoms described. While ODD is plausible and often comorbid, DSM-5 indicates that if both criteria are met, DMDD takes precedence over ODD. So, I should include ODD as a secondary in my differential, but focus primarily on DMDD for the structured list of diagnoses.

**Creating a differential diagnosis list**

The user likely wants a structured list of differential diagnoses rather than just comorbidities. The prompt asks for the top 5 diagnoses with corresponding ICD-10 F-codes, specifying a primary diagnosis and four secondary ones. I’m leaning towards DMDD as primary due to the child’s chronic irritability and outbursts, with ODD and Conduct Disorder as as possible secondary options. Intermittent Explosive Disorder could fit as well. I’ll also consider other related disorders based on the child's background but avoid unsupported assumptions. I need to finalize which to include while staying relevant!

**Formulating the diagnosis list**

I'm considering what the user wants, which seems to be a structured list of five psychiatric diagnoses based on the case vignette. I’ll focus on identifying the primary and four secondary diagnoses while ensuring they have the correct F-codes. For the primary diagnosis, I think Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (F34.81) fits well, alongside Oppositional Defiant Disorder (F91.3) and Intermittent Explosive Disorder (F63.81) as secondary options. Conduct Disorder (F91.1) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (F90.2) might round out the list. Let's ensure clarity and accuracy in the final selection!

**Identifying top diagnoses**

I'm trying to narrow down the most likely primary and secondary diagnoses based on the information available. I’m thinking Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (F34.81) is a strong primary candidate due to the chronic irritability and emotional outbursts. Oppositional Defiant Disorder (F91.3) might also fit as a secondary diagnosis. Then, I’ll consider Intermittent Explosive Disorder (F63.81), Conduct Disorder, childhood-onset type (F91.1), and maybe Unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder (F43.9). Let’s confirm those F-codes, ensuring the list reflects the psychiatric context clearly.

**Finalizing diagnoses list**

I need to present the top five psychiatric diagnoses based on the information about the patient's behaviors. I'm leaning toward Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (F34.81) as my primary, supported by chronic irritability and frequent temper outbursts. Then, I think Oppositional Defiant Disorder (F91.3) fits well as a secondary. Following that, I’ll consider Intermittent Explosive Disorder (F63.81), Conduct Disorder, childhood-onset type (F91.1), and possibly Unspecified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder (F91.9) as my final picks. Let's confirm those codes!

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

I’m considering potential diagnoses based on the patient’s behaviors. First, I'll go with Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (F34.81) as the primary because of the recurrent outbursts. Next is Oppositional Defiant Disorder (F91.3) given argumentative behavior and irritability. I’ll add Intermittent Explosive Disorder (F63.81) and Conduct Disorder, unspecified (F91.9) for additional clarity, since ""Conduct Disorder, childhood-onset type"" may be too specific. Finally, I'll include Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, combined presentation (F90.2) since interrupting is a key symptom.

**Determining differential diagnoses**

The user is asking for a structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses, so I need to focus on the most likely options based on the clinical vignette. I’ve considered several plausible diagnoses, including Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) and Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), both of which seem valid. 

Next, I might include Intermittent Explosive Disorder and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. There's also room for ""Unspecified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder"" as a catch-all. However, given the specifics, I would prioritize the diagnoses that best align with the presented symptoms.

**Refining differential diagnoses**

I've been analyzing which diagnoses to include based on the case details. Since DMDD can coexist with ADHD or conduct disorder, it's crucial to choose the top five diagnoses thoughtfully. My current list includes DMDD, ODD, IED, Conduct Disorder, and ADHD. 

I also thought about adding trauma-related disorders since the patient's background suggests possible attachment issues. However, it seems that PTSD and related diagnoses might not fit. Eventually, I settled on using ""Unspecified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder"" as a catch-all. Let's finalize that list!

**Finalizing diagnoses list**

I'm considering which diagnoses to include in the top five. While Conduct Disorder and ADHD might seem speculative, some flexibility is allowed for plausible options. Given the child's background in foster care, Reactive Attachment Disorder or Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder could fit, but I’m leaning toward Unspecified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder as the fifth option since we lack clear trauma signs.

Ultimately, my final list is:
1. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder - F34.81  
2. Oppositional defiant disorder - F91.3  
3. Intermittent explosive disorder - F63.81

1033,"The patient is a 12-year-old male who is brought to clinic by his mom due to multiple detentions for his behavior.

Mom states that he has started doing the same at home as well, refusing to do his chores, arguing with her when she tells him to do his homework, and mocks her when she confronts him. She notes that in addition to refusal to do chores, he will intentionally create more chores to do, such as making messes and not cleaning them up. When asked directly about his behaviors, the patient looks at the evaluator and rolls his eyes. He tells the evaluator that it’s “none of your business” and kicks the desk.

I'm thinking about using F91.9 for unspecified conduct disorder, but F91.1 is for childhood-onset type. I wonder if F91.9 is the right choice. I need to consider differential diagnoses. The DSM-5-TR specs would ""specify"" conditions. For ADHD, I'm looking at codes like F90.2 combined type and F90.9 unspecified ADHD. It seems crucial to accurately specify these diagnoses given the pediatric context. The top differentials include ODD, CD, ADHD, DMDD, and Intermittent Explosive Disorder. For this presentation, ODD seems to be the primary one.

**Identifying likely diagnoses**

I’m considering potential secondary diagnoses: we should rule out Conduct Disorder and look at ADHD, which commonly coexists and can show up as noncompliance. Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder is an option due to irritability and temper outbursts, while Adjustment Disorder with disturbance of conduct could apply if there’s a significant stressor, like from mom. Intermittent Explosive Disorder seems less likely. Ultimately, besides ODD, the four most plausible diagnoses are Conduct Disorder, ADHD, Adjustment Disorder, and DMDD. I’m also wondering about F91.9 for unspecified conduct disorder.

**Clarifying disorder codes**

I'm trying to sort out the right codes for unspecified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder. It looks like F91.9 might be used, but I need to confirm. According to the DSM-5-TR, for ""Other specified disorder,"" it’s F91.8. I’m looking at ICD-10 codes as well. Conduct disorder codes include options like F91.0 for family context and F91.1 for childhood-onset. F91.2 is for adolescent-onset, which could be the right pick in this case. It seems more fitting than F91.9!

**Determining the appropriate diagnosis code**

At 12 years old, it might seem like a childhood-onset condition, but I can’t be certain, so I'm considering using F91.9 for unspecified conduct disorder. However, that would conflict with coding for unspecified disruptive disorder, which isn’t necessary here. F91.1 for childhood-onset appears to fit better because patterns might have started at school. But I need to stay cautious and go with F91.9 since I’m working with limited information. Yet, I'm questioning if conduct disorder is the most likely diagnosis, as the behaviors described are more about defiance than severe issues.

**Finalizing diagnosis options**

I'm evaluating whether to include ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder,"" but that seems unnecessary. I’m considering Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) as a primary diagnosis. The secondaries might be ADHD, Conduct Disorder, Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD), and Adjustment Disorder with disturbance of conduct. I know ADHD could play a role, but the defiance shown seems more aligned with ODD. 

While figuring out the codes, I’m leaning towards using F91.9 for unspecified conduct disorder, since there's ambiguity about the onset. So, the top five likely diagnoses would be ODD, Adjustment Disorder, Conduct Disorder, ADHD, and DMDD, with some adjustments in order based on plausibility.

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

I need to provide the top 5 most likely diagnoses while following the instructions to avoid including extra clinical reasoning. I can include Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) as the primary diagnosis. For the secondary options, I might list Conduct Disorder F91.9, Attention-deficit/hyperactivity Disorder (unspecified) F90.9, Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder F34.81, and Adjustment Disorder F43.24. I’ll format this as a structured list of diagnoses with corresponding ICD-10 F-codes, ensuring to follow all guidelines and clarifications precisely.","1. Oppositional Defiant Disorder - F91.3

I need to ensure I'm accurate with the diagnostic codes. For Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), I can use F32.x for single episodes based on severity and F33.x for recurrent. Persistent Depressive Disorder is F34.1, while adjustment disorders have specific codes like F43.21 for depressed moods. I should also consider including other related diagnoses. The user is looking for the top five likely diagnoses based on the information given, so I'll focus on plausible features for that.

**Assessing depressive disorder diagnosis**

I need to avoid adding features like mania to the diagnosis. ""Major Depressive Disorder with atypical features"" could be relevant due to symptoms like hypersomnia and weight gain, but it may not fit completely. An ""Unspecified Depressive Disorder"" seems plausible, yet the symptoms presented indicate a clear diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, moderate (F32.1), considering significant impairment. While persistent depressive disorder might be a consideration, the symptom duration suggests it's more likely a recent occurrence.

**Evaluating possible diagnoses**

It seems that Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD) is less likely here. I can consider ""Oppositional Defiant Disorder,"" but the duration isn't quite long enough at a few months. I also looked at ""Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder,"" which requires longer symptoms across multiple settings — that doesn't fit. ""Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood"" may be possible but lacks a clear stressor. Ultimately, Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, moderate (F32.1) is the most fitting diagnosis based on the criteria.

**Considering differential diagnoses**

I’m weighing several diagnoses: Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, Persistent Depressive Disorder, and Social Anxiety Disorder. Social withdrawal might point to depression, but DMDD and ODD focus on irritability. PDD requires symptoms to last a year, which doesn't fit here since it's only a few months. The symptoms don't indicate social anxiety either, leaning towards apathy. ""Other Specified Depressive Disorder"" might fit as a differential, but we already have MDD on the table. ""Depressive Disorder, Unspecified"" seems redundant, and including ""Cyclothymic Disorder"" isn’t appropriate either.

**Determining the top diagnoses**

I’m considering various diagnoses, starting with ""Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Moderate"" as my primary choice. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, and Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder are also on the list. Persistent Depressive Disorder seems less likely due to the duration, and social anxiety isn’t fitting since there’s a lack of fear. Although we could look into alternatives like unspecified depressive disorders, that might be redundant. Since the user asked for the most likely diagnoses, I can list these based on the current symptoms.

**Listing likely diagnoses**

Here are the top five most likely psychiatric diagnoses based on the information provided:

1. Major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate - F32.1

The ICD-10 codes vary by substance; alcohol might be F10.14. I also see that for cocaine-induced bipolar, F14.14 is relevant as it relates to cocaine mood disorders. I need to focus on the top five likely diagnoses, including bipolar I with psychotic features and others like Cannibas intoxication, along with schizoaffective disorder and schizophrenia.

**Evaluating probable diagnoses**

I need to determine the five most likely diagnoses based on the user's data. The presence of prior mood episodes suggests bipolar disorder, especially with psychotic features. Considering the age of onset at 23, which is common for both bipolar and schizophrenia, I see the recent cannabis use might have triggered symptoms. He's showing strong manic signs, like grandiosity and decreased sleep, reinforcing a bipolar diagnosis. I'll ensure I use the correct ICD-10 codes: F31.2 for bipolar I, F12.929 for cannabis intoxication, and F25.0 for schizoaffective disorder.

**Clarifying diagnosis codes**

I'm looking into the various diagnosis codes. For schizoaffective disorder, I have F25.0, which is great. For schizophreniform disorder, F20.81 works too. I want to confirm the codes for brief psychotic disorder; according to my notes, it seems like F23 is appropriate, as it's listed in DSM-5. Moving on, for delusional disorder, I have F22 down. Then for cannabis-induced psychotic disorder, F12.259 seems right for delusions, but I need to ensure I'm clear about how DSM-5 handles this, especially with dependency distinctions.

**Examining substance-induced psychotic disorder codes**

I need to clarify the codes for substance-induced psychotic disorders. For example, the code for ""Alcohol-induced psychotic disorder"" seems to be 291.3 (F10.259) when there's hallucinations involved. Then for DSM-5, ""Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder"" usually uses 292.11 for substances, where you specify which one. Regarding cannabis-induced psychotic disorder, I think 292.11 represents it with delusions, while 292.12 would be for hallucinations. I’ll double-check to ensure I’m getting the right codes!

**Ranking diagnoses based on symptoms**

The patient recently started using cannabis and now shows psychosis. While cannabis can trigger psychosis, symptoms like grandiosity and decreased sleep also suggest a mood disorder, likely bipolar. I need to rank the diagnoses by likelihood and consider schizoaffective and cannabis-induced psychosis. Given his manic presentation, bipolar I with psychotic features seems primary, followed by cannabis intoxication. I’ll also consider cannabis-induced psychotic disorder and schizoaffective disorder. Since symptoms started recently, I can include unspecified schizophrenia spectrum as a differential. I’ll finalize the top five diagnoses using the DSM-5-TR framework.

**Verifying diagnostic codes**

I need to ensure that I’m using the correct DSM-5-TR codes for the diagnoses. The primary one is ""Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, with psychotic features,"" which correlates to F31.2. For ""Cannabis intoxication,"" it should be F12.929. I've got ""Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder, with delusions"" as F12.950. Then for ""Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type,"" it’s F25.0, and for ""Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder,"" it’s F29. I’ll finalize this list now!

**Clarifying DSM-5 codes**

I’m going through the DSM-5 codes to make sure I get them right. For example, ""Alcohol intoxication with delirium"" is 291.0 (F10.121), and ""Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder"" might be F12.950, but I want to ensure it accurately represents the diagnosis. 

It seems I’ll use ""Cannabis use, unspecified with psychotic disorder with delusions"" as it's the best fit. I need to finalize my list of five plausible diagnoses while avoiding any unnecessary speculation, based solely on the existing information. Let's list them out clearly!

**Finalizing diagnostic codes**

It seems I should include ""Unspecified psychotic disorder"" coded as F29 since it doesn't require a specific duration. The symptoms indicate mania, especially with grandiose plans and energetic behavior. 

Now, I need to remember to format the output correctly without adding extra commentary. The user has asked me to provide just the structured list of diagnoses and corresponding F-codes. I’ll make sure to use correct capitalization and punctuation. Let’s finalize the list!","1. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, with psychotic features - F31.2

1036,"Pt is a 20-year-old female with no past psychiatric history came to the clinic seeking help for depression and having passive thoughts of death. She says her mother passed away 2 months back. She reports feeling increasingly depressed since loss of mom, has been crying tearful while talking to the outpatient psychiatrist. She reported she was at work, came back and she found her mom lying in the pool of blood. She reports that her mother committed suicide. She reports she has been having increased nightmares. She has been feeling increasingly depressed for the past 2 months, has problems with appetite, is not going to work, likes to just stay at home as feels mom's presence in the house. She has been mostly staying at home except for some long walks at night at times, lost weight, cannot focus. Her friends provide her support during the difficult time and bring her food and clean her house for her. She has been feeling guilty for ignoring mom while she was going through the depression. She should have been more supportive of her and maybe could have saved her mom. This has been making her feel it was all her fault and that she should be dead too and not live anymore but does not have a plan or an intention to die. She reports having trouble sleeping at night, sleeping approximately 2-3 hours every night, going out for a walk when not sleeping. She has been engaging in increased promiscuous behaviors like having one-night stands with the people she meets on the walks. She reports her energy is okay the next day and has not slept in for about a month. She denied any past medical problems and denied any substance use. She has a history of sexual abuse in the past at age 18.","Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe without psychotic features (F32.2)",,caesa_nagpal,"Major depressive Disorder, single, severe, with mixed features","Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe without psychotic features (F32.2)",,"**Considering mixed features and diagnoses**

Mixed features need observable mania symptoms that show a change from the baseline. The decreased need for sleep is obvious, but increased activity could manifest in long walks or late-night encounters. While these might indicate agitation or risky behavior, they could also be coping mechanisms. Promiscuity aligns with risky behavior—typical in mania, along with impulsivity and elevated mood. I recognize that labeling MDD with mixed features might eliminate the need for a separate bipolar diagnosis. 

However, they want the top 5 diagnoses, and mixed features serve as a specifier, while primary labeling remains MDD F32.2. Other possible diagnoses include: 2. PTSD - F43.10, 3. Other specified trauma-related disorder - F43.8.

**Evaluating possible diagnoses**

I’m looking at Adjustment Disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct - F43.25, or possibly with depressed mood - F43.21 as options. Another possibility is ""Other specified bipolar and related disorder"" - F31.89, especially if mixed features are already included. I do think ""Acute stress disorder"" – F43.0 could fit as a differential, but it might not belong in the top five. 

I want to ensure I’m not listing mutually exclusive conditions. I’ll settle on Primary: Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode; Secondary: PTSD; Tertiary: Other Specified Bipolar; Fourth: Trauma-Related Disorder; Fifth: Adjustment Disorder. That seems reasonable!

**Finalizing diagnostic list**

For this differential list, I realize the prompt is asking for actual diagnoses rather than just rule-outs. They’re looking for a structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses. I need to focus on the top five most likely, treating it as a differential. Here’s my list with codes:

1. Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Severe Without Psychotic Features: F32.2.
2. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: F43.10.
3. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood: F43.21.
4. Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Disturbance: F43.25.
5. Other Specified Trauma-Related Disorder: F43.8.

**Selecting secondary diagnoses**

I need to determine which four secondary diagnoses to include. It’s crucial to rank the top five most likely. Here’s my ranking:

1. Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Severe, Without Psychotic Features (possibly with mixed features).
2. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) ranks next, especially since she has nightmares and trauma exposure.
3. Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder could be a backup, but including PTSD may render it redundant. 
4. Other Specified Bipolar and Related Disorder fits given her decreased need for sleep and risky behavior.
5. Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Disturbance of Emotions and Conduct, or I could consider an Unspecified Depressive Disorder, but it feels less relevant.

**Evaluating PTSD subtypes**

I’m trying to decide whether to treat ""PTSD"" and ""Other specified trauma or stressor"" as separate categories. We need four secondary types, and it seems I can include both while adding two more. I should check the ICD-10 F codes, like F32.2 and F43.10. Notably, F43.8 corresponds to “Other reactions to severe stress,” and that connects to DSM-5-TR. I’m pondering the right adjustment subtype for the behavior described, considering high-risk actions too.

**Finalizing diagnostic options**

I'm thinking about how promiscuity might fit as a behavioral symptom. It seems ""mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct"" could be more fitting than just ""depressed mood,"" given the behavior changes. I’m considering adjustment disorders and how they relate to grief-related symptoms, perhaps F43.21 for depressive moods. But maybe the mixed disturbance code, F43.25, might capture both aspects more effectively. Ultimately, I want to finalize a list of diagnoses and their corresponding codes without further reasoning.

**Confirming diagnostic codes**

I need to pick the right F code for ""Other specified bipolar and related disorder."" In ICD-10-CM, it appears to be F31.89 for ""Other bipolar disorder."" I see that Bipolar II disorder is coded as F31.81, but I'm leaning towards F31.89 for other specified. Additionally, I need to confirm that ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder"" is F43.8, and it looks like that's correct! Now I feel confident in these codes.

**Considering redundancy in terms**

I'm thinking about how including both adjustment disorder and other specified trauma and stressor diagnoses feels redundant. But then I’m telling myself it's okay to have that redundancy. I wonder if I could alternatively consider adding Acute Stress Disorder, but I’m leaning against that option right now. So, I’m still evaluating the best way to frame these concepts without overcomplicating things. I guess it’s about clarity and understanding, so I’ll keep refining my approach!","1.

She minimally engages with you. She was given Lorazepam 2 mg intramuscularly which was helpful to calm her down and she was able to talk more to the team.

I'm trying to recall the ICD-10 codes for substance or medication-induced bipolar disorders. It seems to depend on the type of substance. For instance, antidepressants might be represented by ""F19.14"" or possibly ""F19.94,"" but I should double-check. The codes are generally in the F10-F19 categories, which focus on psychoactive substances and not medications. For ""alcohol-induced bipolar disorder,"" the code is ""F10.14,"" while medications may use ""F06.33."" It's important to refer to the specific substance class for accurate coding.

**Assessing Patient Diagnosis**

The patient denies any substance use, and the medication in question is an SSRI. Unfortunately, there isn't a specific ICD-10 code for SSRI-induced mania. The DSM-5 uses ""F06.33"" for mood disorders related to physiological conditions, but that seems to apply to other medical conditions rather than medications. I should avoid listing medication-induced bipolar to prevent inaccuracies. The user requested the top 5 diagnoses, likely expecting to see antidepressant-induced mania as a differential. I could consider ""Other specified bipolar and related disorder"" or ""Unspecified bipolar and related disorder,"" but that feels redundant.

**Listing Plausible Conditions**

I think it's better to list other plausible conditions for diagnosis. For instance, we can include ""Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type"" (F25.0), ""Brief psychotic disorder"" (F23), ""Delirium"" (F05), ""Adjustment disorder with depressed mood"" (F43.21), and ""Major depressive disorder, single episode"" (F32.1). 

The goal is to provide the top 5 most likely diagnoses, starting with Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, maybe with psychotic features due to disorganized speech. There are symptoms like decreased sleep, increased energy, and spending sprees that meet the criteria for a manic episode. The catatonic features also seem notable.

**Reviewing Diagnosis Codes**

I'm considering how to code ""Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features."" If we interpret ""not making any sense"" as disorganized speech, then psychosis might not be necessary for the diagnosis. Catatonia can occur in mood disorders, too. The patient is confused and altered, which could indicate delirious mania—a severe form involving delirium, but the DSM doesn’t specifically separate that. 

I could also look at ""Delirium due to another medical condition,"" but the lab results aren't conclusive. The patient hasn't eaten well lately, which could lead to mild delirium. For secondary considerations, catatonia associated with bipolar disorder could apply, along with major depressive disorder in partial remission.

**Establishing the Diagnosis**

Let's clarify that F32.4 is for major depressive disorder in partial remission, and I need to be careful with the diagnosis here. The patient exhibited depressive symptoms after her mother's death, which could indicate a major depressive episode, but since it's bipolar I, we usually don’t code MDD separately. 

However, I can list MDD as a potential differential if there's a history of antidepressant-induced mania. The user requested the top 5 diagnoses, so I need to prioritize them correctly. 

With that in mind, I will code ""Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe, with catatonia"" maybe using F31.2, keeping in mind the patient’s symptoms and disorganized speech. While we don’t have clear psychotic features, the altered state and bizarre behavior might support the diagnosis. It’s a complex situation which requires careful consideration—but I’ll aim for accuracy!

**Clarifying Diagnosis Codes**

I’m working through the ICD-10 codes and considering F31.1 for “Bipolar disorder, current episode manic without psychotic symptoms.” If I go with F31.1, it avoids undercoding potential psychosis. But there are several factors to consider, like the presence of mania and its context due to sertraline. 

The need is to identify the top five likely diagnoses. While F31.1 could be primary, I have to explore secondary options like catatonia (F06.1) and substance-induced disorders along with conditions like delirium (F05) or major depressive episode (F32.1). It’s essential that I ensure accuracy while navigating these nuances!

**Determining Diagnosis Codes**

I'm exploring diagnoses for the patient. Lorazepam seems effective, indicating catatonia, which could be associated with bipolar I disorder. Should I code it as ""Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe, with catatonia""? 

I need to consider secondary diagnoses as well, like ""Major depressive disorder"" or ""Adjustment disorder"" for the recent bereavement, but the timing doesn’t fit. The options include differential diagnoses for medication-induced bipolar disorder and evaluating the likelihood of delirium versus schizoaffective disorder based on the patient's presentation. Accuracy is crucial in selecting the correct ICD-10 codes and ensuring the top five potential diagnoses reflect her condition!

**Clarifying Diagnosis Options**

I'm evaluating appropriate diagnosis codes for the patient, focusing on “Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic.” The question arises whether to include medication-induced mania; perhaps I should just list the primary diagnosis. I also need three additional diagnoses, which could include ""Adjustment disorder with depressed mood"" or ""Major depressive disorder,"" but the timing and symptoms complicate that.

I'm leaning towards differentiating among possible conditions like catatonia, delirium, or schizoaffective disorders. I ultimately want five clear diagnoses with the correct ICD-10 codes reflecting her condition accurately!

**Selecting Secondary Diagnoses**

Now I'm narrowing down my list of secondary diagnoses. I'm considering catatonia associated with another mental disorder and substance/medication-induced bipolar disorder, possibly with an unknown code—maybe F06.34? 

Other options could include major depressive disorder or adjustment disorder with depressed mood, especially since the patient has experienced significant stress from a recent bereavement. I need to ensure I choose the top four most likely diagnoses alongside the primary one to reflect her condition accurately. This requires careful thought about her symptoms and timeline!

**Listing Differential Diagnoses**

I’m focusing on the five most likely diagnoses for the case at hand. The primary diagnosis will be ""Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe, without psychotic features with catatonia"" - F31.1. For the second option, there's ""Catatonia associated with another mental disorder"" - F06.1. 

Next, I’ll include ""Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar and Related Disorder"" — I need to verify the appropriate code. I'll also add ""Delirium due to another medical condition"" - F05. Lastly, ""Brief psychotic disorder"" - F23 will round out the list.

**Finalizing Differential Diagnoses**

Let's outline the top diagnoses for the patient's case. The primary diagnosis is ""Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe, with catatonia"" - F31.1. The secondary diagnoses will be ""Catatonia associated with another mental disorder"" - F06.1, and ""Delirium"" - F05.

I should mention that we’re considering factors like the patient's recent depressive episode. It's also relevant to note potential overlaps like ""Adjustment disorder with depressed mood"" - F43.21, which we might also include due to her history. These thoughts will help form a solid differential.

**Clarifying Medication-Induced Conditions**

For medication-induced anxiety disorder, I'm considering DSM-5 coding. I believe the code is F06.4 for ""Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition."" However, it may instead be categorized as ""Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder,"" which could involve other codes based on specific substances.

It’s also crucial to distinguish between features and specifications, as medication effects can complicate the coding process. I think a reasonable consideration for bipolar symptoms related to medication could be noted as F06.33 or F06.34, but with careful attention to accuracy in reporting the primary diagnosis.

**Determining Appropriate Diagnoses**

I'm considering possible diagnoses for a case with medication-induced symptoms. Major depressive disorder (MDD), potentially coded as F32.4, is under review. However, we must ensure there's no redundancy with adjustment disorders, like F43.21. The list also examines bipolar I disorder and recognizes that DSM-5 allows for certain comorbidities, although MDD can’t co-occur with mania.

I'm concluding that a differential diagnosis approach is best, aiming to list top 5 likely diagnoses including bipolar I disorder with catatonia, along with substance-induced disorders and delirium as potential considerations.

**Choosing Proper Diagnoses**

I'm weighing the most fitting diagnosis for this case, starting with Bipolar I disorder for the primary diagnosis, coded F31.1, and considering catatonia as a secondary diagnosis with code F06.1. I'm also examining secondary potential conditions like substance/medication-induced bipolar disorder and delirium.

To decide on the correct code for substance-induced bipolar, it looks like F19.94 for ""other psychoactive substance use, unspecified"" might work best since the medication isn't abused. It seems important to differentiate between types of mood disorders properly per DSM-5 guidelines.

**Refining Diagnosis Codes**

I'm exploring diagnosis codes related to alcohol use and mood disorders. The codes for alcohol abuse indicate combinations of abuse, dependence, and unspecified use, all linked to mood disorders. It seems that F10.14 covers alcohol abuse with mood disorder but doesn't classify between mania and depression.

I'm considering how DSM separates substance-induced disorders, potentially using F1x.14 for bipolar and F1x.24 for depressive disorders. For medication-induced bipolar disorder, F19.94 might be the best fit since it indicates unspecified use, avoiding implications of abuse. I'll finalize the diagnostic list, keeping all these details in mind.

**Finalizing Diagnosis Codes**

I'm considering the most appropriate diagnoses and their corresponding ICD-10 codes. My primary choice is ""Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, without psychotic features"" coded as F31.1, along with ""Catatonia associated with another mental disorder"" as F06.1. 

I've also noted the need for ""Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder,"" possibly coded F19.94. Delirium is another important consideration (F05), as is ""Brief psychotic disorder"" (F23). 

I’ll present a structured list without extra text, making sure everything aligns correctly.

**Finalizing Diagnosis Codes**

I'm unsure about code F19.94, but after checking, it does exist. It's categorized as ""Other psychoactive substance use, unspecified with other psychoactive substance-induced mood disorder."" I might consider other codes like F06.33, but I believe F19.94 could fit here.

Ultimately, I'll stick to five distinct diagnoses without extra text. So here’s the final structured list:

1. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, without psychotic features (with catatonia) - F31.1
2. Catatonia associated with another mental disorder (mood disorder) - F06.1

1038,"Pt is a 19-year-old female who presented to the student health clinic at her university with increase in anxiety symptoms that started since last 3 months at the beginning of the school year. She reports her main concern is she will not be successful and will not be able to make the grades she needs to get a medical school. She feels anxious most of the days. She says her heart rate goes up, she starts to sweat, with racing thoughts and having problems with sleep. She notices she is unable to breathe, gets nauseous at times when it is very bad anxiety. When a teacher calls on her in school, she becomes “frozen with fear” if she will say something ill-informed or inappropriate. She has hard time engaging with other peers at college. She also reports feeling anxious about if she will ever be able to make friends with his anxiety. She gets panic attacks at times where she describes she has racing thoughts of what is everyone thinking or maybe they are laughing at her or talking about her. She starts to breath heavily, feels numb but does not feel she will die. Her attacks are usually triggered when she must present in front of her classmates. This makes her anxious to the point of getting paralyzed and cannot concentrate on her work. When she goes back home, she can do better. She is calmer and can enjoy time with friends and family.

She aspires to become a physician one day and able to help others.",Adjustment disorder with anxiety (F43.2),,caesa_nagpal,Adjustment disorder with anxiety,Adjustment disorder with anxiety (F43.2),,"**Evaluating Social Anxiety Disorder**

I’m looking at the DSM-5-TR criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder, which includes fear of scrutiny in social situations, results in avoidance or intense fear, and must persist for at least six months. The case involves a teacher calling on a student who then feels paralyzed and fears making mistakes. These symptoms, like panic attacks and difficulty engaging with peers, seem to have started around three months ago. There might be a history prior to school too.

**Analyzing Social Anxiety Disorder Onset**

It seems she might have had some social anxiety before, but it has worsened recently. The fact that symptoms began only three months ago raises questions about meeting the six-month persistence criterion. However, in practice, a diagnosis could still be made if the symptoms are clinically significant. The DSM mentions that for Generalized Anxiety Disorder, there's excessive worry for at least six months. I guess we need to consider options based on these details.

**Considering Adjustment Disorder Diagnosis**

She seems to worry about grades and friends, feeling anxious most days, and experiencing sleep problems, which have persisted for about three months. Given this time frame, she would not meet the criteria for a primary anxiety disorder. Thus, an ""Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety"" diagnosis could be appropriate because her symptoms arose after the start of the school year. However, we need to identify specific stressors and determine if the symptoms reflect significant impairment, like difficulty concentrating and engaging. There are also elements of social anxiety that could complicate the diagnosis.

**Determining Diagnoses for Anxiety Symptoms**

If symptoms have likely been present for over six months, then Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) might become the primary diagnosis, with Adjustment Disorder as a secondary option. However, if SAD is present, Adjustment Disorder usually isn't diagnosed. The task is to suggest the top five diagnoses, including Adjustment Disorder if it doesn't meet full criteria. Given the user's situation, SAD seems most likely since social anxiety often starts earlier and may worsen with environmental changes. I'd focus on SAD, rather than performance-only specifier, since she struggles with engaging with peers too.

**Crafting a List of Diagnoses**

I’m navigating the possible diagnoses for this situation, where Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) might be primary but duration doesn’t quite fit. I can consider ""Other Specified Anxiety Disorder,"" which includes social anxiety symptoms and panic attacks due to the shorter duration. However, I should stick to the DSM criteria. After weighing options like ""Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety,"" which reflects adaptation to college stress, I’ll craft a structured list of the top diagnoses that could capture her symptoms. 

1. Social anxiety disorder (F40.10)
2. Adjustment disorder with anxiety (F43.22)
3. Generalized anxiety disorder (F41.1)
4. Other specified anxiety disorder (F41.8)
5. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (F60.5)

**Evaluating Primary and Secondary Diagnoses**

I’m analyzing the situation to determine the primary diagnosis. The timeline suggests increased anxiety symptoms linked to the start of the school year, which could indicate previous baseline anxiety but has worsened. Her concerns around academic success and her physical panic symptoms align with Social Anxiety Disorder. However, with only three months of symptoms, we might not meet the typical six-month requirement. I’ll suggest Social Anxiety Disorder as primary and explore other options like Adjustment Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder as potential secondary diagnoses, based on the features presented.

**Determining ICD-10 Codes and Diagnoses**

I'm sorting through potential diagnoses and their respective ICD-10 codes. I have Social Anxiety Disorder as F40.10 and Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety as F43.22. It's crucial we carefully select five most plausible diagnoses without providing clinical reasoning in the output. I’m leaning towards Social Anxiety Disorder as primary and considering Adjustment Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder as viable options. Panic Disorder and Other Specified Anxiety Disorder are also in the mix. My final list will prioritize the most likely diagnoses based on the available information.

**Finalizing Diagnoses and F-Codes**

I'm trying to finalize a list of diagnoses with F-codes, focusing on the most plausible options. I have Social Anxiety Disorder as F40.10, Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety as F43.22, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder as F41.1. For the fourth option, I'm considering Other Specified Anxiety Disorder as F41.8 to cover subthreshold issues. Lastly, for the fifth position, I need to decide between Panic Disorder and Unspecified Anxiety Disorder. I want to ensure that I'm accurately selecting these without fabricating any information.

**Final Diagnosis List Preparation**

I’m finalizing the list of top five likely diagnoses with their corresponding F-codes. I’m considering Social Anxiety Disorder, Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. For the other two, I'm leaning towards Other Specified Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder. However, there's some uncertainty with the Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder, so I'm weighing that one critically. I need to ensure that all chosen diagnoses accurately reflect the patient’s situation without redundancies. It's crucial to present a structured and precise list based on the information provided.

**Determining Primary Diagnoses**

I’m assessing the top five likely diagnoses, prioritizing Social Anxiety Disorder due to her anxiety in unfamiliar evaluation contexts. Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety follows, as it fits her context. I’m considering whether to list Other Specified Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, or even Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder or Avoidant Personality Disorder. I’m carefully weighing these options based on available evidence to ensure accuracy. The more I think about it, it feels essential to differentiate between them effectively while staying within DSM-5-TR criteria.

**Refining Anxiety Diagnoses**

I'm weighing potential diagnoses, primarily considering Social Anxiety Disorder due to her feelings in evaluation contexts. While Avoidant Personality Disorder (AvPD) fits some characteristics, it's not pervasive enough for a diagnosis. I think including Unspecified Personality Disorder wouldn't be appropriate, so I lean towards listing Generalized Anxiety Disorder alongside Adjustment Disorder and Panic Disorder. I also find that including Other Specified Anxiety Disorder can help fulfill the required five diagnoses while ensuring each one remains plausible and based on her symptoms.

**Finalizing Anxiety Diagnoses**

I’m considering public speaking fear as a sign of social anxiety. There’s a possibility for including Specific Phobia, but it seems less likely. I believe the primary diagnosis should be Social Anxiety Disorder (F40.10), and as secondaries, I'll go with Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety (F43.22), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1), Panic Disorder (F41.0), and Other Specified Anxiety Disorder (F41.8). This list aligns with the DSM criteria and is supported by the evidence presented. Let's finalize that!","1. Social anxiety disorder (social phobia) - F40.10  
2. Adjustment disorder with anxiety - F43.22

1039,"Pt is a 25-year-old male with past psychiatric history of depression diagnosed 3 months ago came in here for increased voices and feeling paranoid. He reports he has been hearing voices for the past one month which tell him multiple things. Some of the voices are “good” voices that tell him to take care of himself while others are “bad” telling him to hurt himself at times. He says 3 weeks ago; he was admitted to a hospital because he drank bleach secondary to voices telling him to do so. He reports feeling paranoid that someone will come and hurt him. He thinks some enemies can hear him through the vents at home and can know what he is thinking. He is scared for his life and tells his parents he wants to kill these people but does not know where they live. He gets scared to the point he is not sleeping for multiple days and looking for these men in the attic and different parts of his house. He reports on and off poor sleep but for the past 2-3 days before admission he was unable to sleep much. His appetite has been low and cannot focus. He feels sad and depressed about all these people coming after him. He reports since these people started to follow him, he has been feeling sadder and more depressed. He denied any suicidal ideations. His mom describes him mostly staying in his room, does not take shower many times, must be encouraged or forced sometimes to take shower. He stopped talking to his friends, likes to stay on his own now. She feels he is not motivated to do anything around him. She reports six months back he was helping her with house chores, had a job distributing papers in the neighborhood. He denied any medical problems. He denied any allergies to medications, has family history of maternal grandmother diagnosed with Schizophrenia. He reports he was started on Sertraline 50 mg daily for depression without much benefit. His symptoms are getting worse by the day. He denied any substance use problems.",Schizophreniform Disorder (F20.81),,caesa_nagpal,Schizophreniform Disorder,Schizophreniform Disorder (F20.81),,"**Clarifying ICD-10 Codes**

I’m realizing that F20.81 refers to ICD-10-CM used in the US, but the user’s question is asking about the ICD-10 F-codes from the WHO for mental disorders. For example, the code for schizophreniform is F20.81, schizophrenia is F20.9, and schizoaffective depressive type is F25.1. I also need to include codes for major depressive disorder, like F32.3, and consider the timeline, including a past diagnosis of depression from three months ago.

**Assessing Mental Health Symptoms**

I’m processing a situation where the user is experiencing increased voices and paranoia. They've been hearing voices for about a month and were hospitalized three weeks ago after drinking bleach due to these voices. They feel paranoid, believing enemies can hear their thoughts. This person hasn’t slept well for days and has low appetite, feeling sad and depressed as they feel pursued. They've withdrawn from social interactions, mostly staying in their room and needing encouragement to shower, though they currently deny suicidal ideation.

**Evaluating Motivation and Symptoms**

I’m assessing a situation where the user feels unmotivated. Six months ago, they were actively helping with chores and had a job distributing papers. There are no current medical problems, but a family history of schizophrenia exists. They started sertraline 50mg for depression three months ago, but symptoms are worsening. Denying substance use, it seems there has been a functional decline over at least six months. Given this, I’m considering whether they might fit the criteria for schizophreniform disorder versus schizophrenia, but the diagnosis needs careful evaluation.

**Analyzing Motivation and Decline**

I’m looking at a situation where someone feels that another person is unmotivated. Six months ago, he was helping with chores and had a neighborhood job, but now he has stopped. It’s unclear when the decline began—maybe 3 months back, or it could have started at some point between six months and now. For a diagnosis of schizophreniform, we need symptoms to last 1-6 months. He has had a depression diagnosis for the past three months, which may indicate a prodromal phase for schizophrenia rather than a clear episode.

**Identifying Potential Diagnoses**

I'm evaluating a complex case with potential symptoms for schizophrenia spectrum disorders. The disturbance may have lasted around 3 to 4 months, fitting the timeframe for diagnosing schizophreniform disorder. As I consider the primary diagnosis, it seems reasonable to opt for ""schizophreniform disorder"" while also acknowledging the possibility of secondary options like ""schizophrenia"" or ""major depressive disorder with psychotic features."" 

Other considerations for my top five include unspecified depressive disorder and schizoaffective disorder, taking into account the auditory hallucinations and negative symptoms. The user has shown functional decline and worsening symptoms despite treatment.

**Assessing Diagnoses**

I'm weighing the duration of psychosis and how it might align with schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder. If the disturbance lasted about 6 months, that leans toward schizophrenia, but the evidence for continuous signs isn't concrete. Given the need for a nuanced understanding, I’m considering ""Schizophreniform disorder"" as my primary diagnosis, along with possible secondary diagnoses like ""schizophrenia,"" ""major depressive disorder,"" and ""schizoaffective disorder."" 

I still need to prioritize the top five diagnoses with their proper ICD-10 codes, considering all the evidence.

**Listing Diagnoses**

I’m focusing on creating a structured list of psychiatric diagnoses while considering comorbid depression. For the primary diagnosis, I think ""Schizophreniform disorder"" fits best due to the active psychosis duration of 1 month, suggesting less than 6 months of overall disturbance. 

I’ll include secondary options like ""Schizophrenia"" for differential, along with ""Major depressive disorder,"" and ""Schizoaffective disorder."" It's crucial to ensure that the diagnoses are plausible based on the information provided without making assumptions. I’m clarifying the order to reflect the most likely scenarios.

**Choosing Diagnoses**

I'm trying to outline potential psychiatric diagnoses. It seems ""Schizophrenia"" may be the best primary diagnosis since there are indications of continuous negative symptoms over 6 months, plus active psychosis for a month. However, the ambiguity around the timeline complicates things. I can list both ""Schizophreniform disorder"" and ""Schizophrenia"" for the top 5 diagnoses, ensuring to include relevant ICD-10 codes. Let's finalize this structured list. 

So the options may include:  
1. Schizophrenia: F20.9  
2. Schizophreniform disorder: F20.81  
3. Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type: F25.1  
4. Major depressive disorder, severe with psychotic features: F32.3  
5. Brief psychotic disorder: F23

**Determining Diagnoses**

I’m working on structuring a list of psychiatric diagnoses. Initially, it seems ""Schizophreniform disorder"" is the best primary diagnosis due to one month of active symptoms and uncertainty around the total duration being less than six months. The ICD-10 code for this is F20.81. 

I’ll include secondary diagnoses such as ""Schizophrenia"" (F20.9), ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" (F32.A), ""Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type"" (F25.1), and ""Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe with psychotic features"" (F32.3). Let’s finalize this list.

**Finalizing Psychiatric Diagnoses**

I’m evaluating the most plausible top five psychiatric diagnoses to provide. Schizophreniform disorder (F20.81) is primary due to sufficient active symptoms. I’ll also include Schizophrenia (F20.9) as a secondary diagnosis, along with Unspecified depressive disorder (F32.A), Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type (F25.1), and Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe with psychotic features (F32.3). It's important to ensure the codes are accurate and relevant for the diagnoses listed. Now, let's structure that correctly without additional text or reasoning.

**Determining Diagnoses List**

I’m evaluating the most likely diagnoses based on depressive symptoms and psychotic features. While Schizophreniform disorder (F20.81) could be primary, I’m considering whether to include Major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate (F32.1), or Unspecified depressive disorder (F32.A). It seems plausible to list Schizophrenia (F20.9) and Schizoaffective disorder (F25.1) as well. I can finalize with Brief psychotic disorder (F23) to reach the top five diagnoses correctly formatted. 

1. Schizophreniform disorder - F20.81  
2. Unspecified depressive disorder - F32.A  
3. Schizophrenia - F20.9  
4. Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type - F25.1  
5. Brief psychotic disorder - F23

**Finalizing Diagnosis List**

I'm focusing on including diagnoses that plausibly explain the symptoms but not necessarily comorbid ones. It's essential to prioritize the top five likely ones: Schizophreniform disorder and schizophrenia are on the spectrum, so including both is reasonable. I'll list diagnoses such as schizoaffective disorder, major depressive disorder with psychotic features, and brief psychotic disorder. It’s crucial to use the correct DSM-5-TR names and codes.

1. Schizophreniform disorder - F20.81  
2. Schizophrenia - F20.9

1040,"Pt is a 42-year-old female who came into the emergency room reporting auditory hallucinations for a day that have been telling her to hurt herself. She reports she is not from the city and is traveling for her work. She reports she has past psychiatric history of depression three years back and reports she has been off medications and her symptoms have been well controlled. She started feeling sad now that she is hearing voices, and they are telling her to kill herself and she is worried for her safety. She talked to her mom on the phone and mom asked her to call 911 so she can go the emergency room. She has been staying at the hotel for the past one day. She planned to go to her work for the next couple of days and wanted to look for houses to move to this new city. On admission to the emergency room, she is seen to be very scared, thinks she is in her hometown and that the year currently was her birth year. She was not oriented to time and place. Her blood pressure is 150/90, pulse 110, temp of 98.6, saturation 97 %.

She denied any medical problems.",Other psychoactive substance related disorders (F19),,caesa_nagpal,Substance/Medication induced psychotic disorder,Other psychoactive substance related disorders (F19),,"**Considering depressive and anxiety disorders**

I'm exploring potential diagnoses, like Unspecified Depressive Disorder (F32.A) and Major Depressive Disorder (F32.9). In the vignette, symptoms show they're well-controlled but appear again after four to five days, which may not qualify for major depressive episode criteria. I might consider ""Other Specified Depressive Disorder"" if they're causing impairment. Additionally, I'd list ""Delirium due to alcohol withdrawal"" as a primary diagnosis, with severe Alcohol Use Disorder as a secondary consideration.

**Clarifying alcohol-induced disorders**

I'm considering a diagnosis of Alcohol Withdrawal with Delirium as the primary condition, but also exploring ""Alcohol Withdrawal with Perceptual Disturbance."" I should double-check the proper ICD-10 codes for Alcohol-Induced Psychotic Disorder. I'm recalling that F10.259 refers to Alcohol Dependence with an unspecified psychotic disorder, while F10.251 might be Alcohol Dependence with Hallucinations. I'll opt for F10.251 for clarity. The fourth consideration could be Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in remission.

**Determining depression diagnosis**

I'm reflecting on her past depression from three years ago, which was well-controlled off medication, potentially placing her in remission. The task asks for the top five most likely diagnoses for her current presentation, considering her history. While DSM-5 allows for specifiers like ""Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in full remission,"" I realize she may not meet all the criteria. It seems F33.40 (Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in remission, unspecified) is appropriate, but I might lean towards F33.42 if I'm confident. Still, I'll settle on F33.40.

**Evaluating psychotic and delirium diagnoses**

I'm considering diagnoses like Brief Psychotic Disorder (F23) or Unspecified Psychotic Disorder (F29). I think Brief Psychotic Disorder is relevant, but the disorientation leans towards delirium. ""Delirium, unspecified” (F05) is another option, though it's not essential. Alcohol withdrawal delirium seems most likely, given the history of withdrawal seizures and recent drink cessation. For the top five diagnoses, I’m leaning towards Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium, Alcohol Use Disorder, and possibly secondary effects like Major Depressive Disorder in remission or Unspecified Anxiety Disorder.

**Finalizing the diagnosis list**

I'm identifying key diagnoses here, and alcohol withdrawal delirium seems to be the primary diagnosis due to her recent history and symptoms. For the secondary diagnoses, I’m considering severe alcohol use disorder, alcohol-induced psychotic disorder with hallucinations, major depressive disorder in remission, and possibly an unspecified anxiety disorder or adjustment disorder. However, since her psychotic symptoms occur during delirium, I’ll avoid listing alcohol-induced psychotic disorder definitively. So, my structured list of top diagnoses includes alcohol withdrawal delirium and appropriate secondary conditions.

**Refining the diagnosis list**

I'm trying to clarify secondary diagnoses, particularly concerning alcohol use disorder and major depressive disorder. It seems best to categorize her past depression as ""Major depressive disorder, single episode, in full remission,"" which corresponds to F32.5. I've been considering if we should include possibilities like ""Delirium"" or ""Substance-induced psychotic disorder,"" but I've got to focus on top diagnoses. So, ultimately, I’ll narrow down to five: Alcohol withdrawal delirium, severe alcohol use disorder, alcohol-induced psychotic disorder with hallucinations, MDD in remission, and a rule-out for unspecified schizophrenia spectrum disorder.

**Finalizing the ICD-10 Codes**

I need to ensure I have valid ICD-10 F-codes for my diagnoses. After verifying, I've listed the following codes: Alcohol dependence with withdrawal delirium (F10.231), uncomplicated alcohol dependence (F10.20), alcohol dependence with alcohol-induced psychotic disorder (F10.251), major depressive disorder in full remission (F32.5), and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum disorder (F29). I think to finalize, the top five likely diagnoses should include alcohol withdrawal delirium, severe alcohol use disorder, a potential brief psychotic disorder, and single-episode major depressive disorder, given her recent symptoms and history.

**Diagnosing Alcohol Use Disorder and Other Conditions**

I’m evaluating the evidence for alcohol use disorder, noting recent drinking behavior and a history of withdrawal seizures. This context suggests a significant dependence. For major depressive disorder, I see past depression but need to consider whether it’s in full remission or unspecified. Additionally, the patient shows signs of anxiety, but I’m unsure about labeling it definitively. My top five potential diagnoses include: alcohol withdrawal delirium (F10.231), severe alcohol use disorder (F10.20), major depressive disorder in remission (F32.5), and possibly something like adjustment disorder.

**Finalizing Diagnoses and Codes**

I’m reviewing possible diagnoses, starting with substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder as an alternative. I'm confirming the ICD-10 codes, like F10.231 for alcohol withdrawal delirium and F10.20 for alcohol use disorder. 

For major depressive disorder, I’m considering F32.5 for single episode in remission. I also think F41.9 fits for unspecified anxiety disorder. My final list of diagnoses includes: 1. Alcohol withdrawal delirium (F10.231), 2. Severe alcohol use disorder (F10.20), 3. Major depressive disorder in full remission (F32.5), 4. Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood (F43.23), and 5. Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder (F10.251).

**Refining the Diagnosis List**

I'm evaluating the fifth diagnosis and considering options like ""Other substance-induced psychotic disorder"" or ""Delirium due to another medical condition."" However, it seems a better fit to include ""Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder."" 

My final list of diagnoses is shaping up as follows: 1. Alcohol withdrawal delirium - F10.231, 2. Alcohol use disorder, severe - F10.20, 3. Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder, alcohol-induced - F10.251, 4. Delirium due to another medical condition - F05, and 5. Major depressive disorder, single episode, in full remission - F32.5. Let's finalize this structured set!

**Finalizing Diagnoses**

I'm weighing the differences between including specific diagnoses. I think I should choose: 

1. Alcohol withdrawal delirium - F10.231  
2. Alcohol use disorder, severe - F10.20  
3. Major depressive disorder in remission - F32.5  
4. Alcohol-induced psychotic disorder (if hallucinations continue) - F10.251  
5. Delirium due to another medical condition - F05  

Looking at the evidence, I believe prioritizing these makes sense given her history and current symptoms. It's a careful balance to ensure that I include the most likely diagnoses while still acknowledging the complexities.

**Choosing Diagnoses**

I’m thinking about which psychiatric diagnoses to include. Since disorientation is a factor, I could include ""Delirium due to another medical condition"" as an alternative. For the final five diagnoses, here's what I’m considering:

1. Alcohol withdrawal delirium - F10.231
2. Alcohol use disorder, severe - F10.20
3. Alcohol-induced psychotic disorder with hallucinations - F10.251
4. Major depressive disorder, single episode in full remission - F32.5
5. Delirium due to another medical condition - F05  

This selection takes into account both current symptoms and relevant history without duplicating conditions. I'll ensure these codes match the DSM-5-TR criteria.

**Deciding on Diagnoses**

I'm considering how to best classify the conditions effectively. I think I might go with “Alcohol use disorder” but perhaps without specific severity details since I lack some symptom information. 

For major depressive disorder, I should specify ""single episode, in full remission"" due to her previous history of depression that seems under control now. I'm thinking the top five could be:

1. Alcohol withdrawal delirium - F10.231
2. Alcohol use disorder - F10.20 
3. Major depressive disorder, single episode in full remission - F32.5
4. Alcohol-induced psychotic disorder (for potential hallucinations)
5. Delirium due to another medical condition. 

I think this will cover the likely diagnoses!

**Evaluating Diagnoses for Symptoms**

I'm assessing alternative diagnoses if the primary isn’t alcohol withdrawal delirium. Other possibilities include ""Substance-induced delirium,"" ""Delirium due to another medical condition,"" or ""Brief psychotic disorder."" Structuring my final list, I want to make sure I include “Alcohol withdrawal delirium” as primary and then:

1. Alcohol withdrawal delirium - F10.231 
2. Alcohol use disorder - F10.20
3. Alcohol-induced psychotic disorder with hallucinations - F10.251
4. Delirium due to another medical condition - F05
5. Major depressive disorder, single episode, in full remission - F32.5

I’ll double-check the validity of the codes and ensure they’re corresponding correctly!

**Finalizing Diagnosis List**

I’m considering whether alcohol-induced psychotic disorder is more likely than delirium due to another medical condition. Given the patient’s delirium is likely from alcohol withdrawal, I think alcohol-induced psychotic disorder is less probable due to impaired orientation. Ordering by likelihood, I’ve decided on this ranking:

1. Alcohol withdrawal delirium - F10.231  
2. Alcohol use disorder - F10.20  
3. Delirium due to another medical condition - F05  
4. Alcohol-induced psychotic disorder, with hallucinations - F10.251  
5. Major depressive disorder, single episode, in full remission - F32.5

I'm thinking of how to categorize anxiety disorders and ensure the codes are correct. For example, recurrent nightmares could list as ""Nightmare disorder"" if they're causing distress, but I'm not certain about other specifics. 

I plan to compile a list including:

- Separation Anxiety Disorder: ICD-10-CM F93.0
- Generalized Anxiety Disorder: 300.02 (F41.1)
- Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety: 309.24 (F43.22)
- Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: 300.3 (F42)
- Nightmare Disorder: 307.47 (F51.5)

Top choices seem to be separation, GAD, and adjustment, while OCD is lower priority. Nightmares may fit if they are causing real issues.

**Structuring anxiety diagnoses**

I'm considering what to include in my list of anxiety diagnoses and how to format it properly. I think ""Nightmare disorder"" might be a good choice since it has a distinct DSM diagnosis. I plan to structure the final output as a numbered list of the top five diagnoses and their corresponding F-codes, avoiding any abbreviations.

I should also reassess whether Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) could be the primary diagnosis instead of separation anxiety, especially given the user's symptoms over the last seven months, which seem significant.

**Analyzing separation anxiety**

The user is experiencing persistent worries about losing an important person, leading to racing thoughts throughout the day. This has affected their focus, resulting in declining grades and complaints from teachers. Friends have drifted away, increasing feelings of loneliness at school. They struggle with poor sleep and nightmares related to their fears. Their desire to spend time with their mom suggests a strong attachment. This clearly aligns with separation anxiety disorder—showing distress, reluctance to go to school, and symptoms lasting more than four weeks.

**Determining anxiety disorders**

I'm analyzing the user's situation regarding anxiety. Primarily, they worry about their mother's safety, which seems to suggest separation anxiety disorder. While there's a chance they could have generalized anxiety disorder if worries spanned multiple domains, it looks like their focus is mainly on their mom. 

I should also consider ""Other Specified Anxiety Disorder"" with separation features. Additionally, there's a possibility for adjustment disorder given the recent loss. I need to ensure I include the correct ICD-10 F-codes for OCD and nightmare disorder as well.

**Creating the final diagnosis list**

I'm putting together the final list of anxiety disorders and their accompanying ICD-10 F-codes. Here’s what I have:

1. Separation Anxiety Disorder - F93.0

I can't strongly support delirium, although it's still a plausible option. The user is asking for the top five likely diagnoses, and while delirium could be a consideration given the symptoms like encephalitis and seizures, it's not fully described. Anti-NMDA can indeed lead to a delirium-like state, but the initial presentation involves paranoia and hallucinations without disorientation. Alternatively, there’s ""Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder"" – sometimes used when full criteria aren't met. Ultimately, I need to focus on providing the top five diagnoses relevant to the case described.

**Determining diagnoses**

I need to provide five diagnoses, including one primary and four secondary, which could be considered rule-outs. The user has asked for differential diagnoses, so I must focus on the most likely options while ensuring they all fit within DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses and have F codes. 

Some potential diagnoses could include ""Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition,"" ""Brief Psychotic Disorder"" (F23), ""Schizophreniform Disorder"" (F20.81), and ""Schizophrenia"" (F20.9). For the fifth, I might consider ""Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder"" (F28), since the others may not fit perfectly with the symptoms discussed.

**Finalizing diagnoses**

I’m considering F28 for ""Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder,"" which might be more suitable than listing schizophrenia. They want the top five diagnoses, and F28 might reflect an ""attenuated psychosis syndrome."" 

However, I could also think about ""Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder"" (F29) as a common option for acute unknown causes. ""Delirium Due to Another Medical Condition"" (F05) seems relevant, too, since anti-NMDA encephalitis can lead to delirium. Ultimately, I need to ensure these reflect the circumstances described.

**Selecting top diagnoses**

I’m considering various options for the top five diagnoses. I think including ""Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition"" (F06.2) is a strong choice given the anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. Then, there's ""Delirium Due to Another Medical Condition"" (F05), which might link to the encephalitis and seizure. 

Next, I’m considering ""Brief Psychotic Disorder"" (F23), ""Schizophreniform Disorder"" (F20.81), and ""Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder"" (F29). While listing schizophrenia (F20.9) might seem less relevant, we need to focus on the most likely diagnoses for this case.

**Assessing psychiatric diagnoses**

I’m focusing on identifying five key psychiatric diagnoses, prioritizing the prominent signs and symptoms described. The primary diagnosis will be ""Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition"" (F06.2) linked to anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. For secondary diagnoses, I’m considering ""Delirium Due to Another Medical Condition"" (F05), ""Brief Psychotic Disorder"" (F23), and ""Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder"" (F29). I need to ensure I have unique, appropriate diagnoses for each category, while also weighing the relevance of including substance-induced psychosis or other disorders not supported by the case details.

**Listing psychiatric diagnoses**

I’m working on organizing my list of psychiatric diagnoses based on the specific medical context. My primary diagnosis is ""Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition"" (F06.2). Following that, I need to include four secondary diagnoses: 

1. ""Delirium Due to Another Medical Condition"" (F05)
2. ""Brief Psychotic Disorder"" (F23)
3. ""Schizophreniform Disorder"" (F20.81)
4. ""Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder"" (F29).

It’s essential to focus on clarity without adding extra details or rationale in the output.

**Finalizing psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm assembling a list of top psychiatric diagnoses based on the case details. Here's where I stand: 

1. Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis) - F06.2
2. Brief Psychotic Disorder - F23
3. Schizophreniform Disorder - F20.81
4. Schizophrenia - F20.9
5. Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder - F19.959

It’s crucial to structure this list without additional explanations or details, just the diagnoses and their corresponding codes. This should align with the user's request for clarity and specificity.

**Assessing psychotic disorder codes**

I'm checking the accuracy of the Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder code, F19.959. I realize I need to verify various ICD-10-CM codes related to these disorders. While considering other possibilities, I think the primary diagnosis needs to be ""Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition"" (F06.2) due to the autoimmune encephalitis. 

For the secondary diagnoses, potential options include Brief Psychotic Disorder (F23), Schizophreniform Disorder (F20.81), Delirium due to another medical condition (F05), and Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum (F29). Overall, I must ensure the top five codes are clearly defined and appropriate.

**Finalizing top diagnoses**

I'm considering the structured list for the top five diagnoses based on the user's request. The primary diagnosis will be ""Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition"" (F06.2), particularly because it relates to anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. 

The secondary diagnoses are: 
1. Delirium Due to Another Medical Condition - F05 
2. Brief Psychotic Disorder - F23 
3. Schizophreniform Disorder - F20.81 
4. Schizophrenia - F20.9.

I've confirmed the accuracy of all the F-codes, especially focusing on the importance of the prominent delusions in this case.

**Finalizing the diagnosis list**

I need to make sure the diagnosis list includes full names and follows the instruction to only use F-codes for psychiatric diagnoses. Here’s the precise formatting without any extra commentary:

Psychiatry is consulted for depression. The patient has been hospitalized for 7 days now, and the course has been complicated by a DVT. On assessment, the pt appears dysphoric with a constricted affect. He shares that being in the hospital and receiving this new cancer diagnosis has caused a major disruption in his life. Previously, he was still working as a patent lawyer and running his own law firm. He states that since the diagnosis (which he received 1 month ago), his mood has been more depressed with anhedonia, hopelessness, helplessness, low energy, and low appetite which he attributes to the nausea caused by his chemotherapy. He feels constantly worried about his cancer and what will happen to him and his family. The patient is married to his wife for 30 years and has 2 children with 4 grandchildren. He is concerned about the finances, getting his estate planning in order, and worried about what will happen to his wife if he were to pass. He states prior to receiving this diagnosis, he did not have any difficulties with depression. He had a distant history of anxiety when he was in law school, but he states it has since been better controlled with therapy. He has never taken psychiatric medication and never seen a psychiatrist.",Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depression (F42.23),,juliana_zhang,Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depression,Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depression (F42.23),,"**Evaluating diagnoses**

I'm working on a list of diagnoses based on the prompt, which asks for the top five with their corresponding ICD-10 codes — focusing on the primary diagnosis and four secondary ones. I included Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood, Major Depressive Disorder, and Other Specified Anxiety Disorder. I’ve confirmed that there is an ICD-10 code for Other Specified Anxiety Disorders, but I’m questioning if having Unspecified Anxiety Disorder is redundant. I’m crafting this final diagnosis list carefully!

**Considering secondary diagnoses**

I’m thinking about possible secondary diagnoses for a primary one. One option for line five could be ""Other Specified Depressive Disorder"" (F32.8). I want to evaluate which four secondary diagnoses would be sensible and distinct. Some candidates include Adjustment Disorders with Depressed Mood and Anxiety, Major Depressive Disorder, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. There might also be consideration for Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder, but I need to confirm how the ICD connects those terms, especially with Chemo-related symptoms impacting mood.

**Evaluating diagnostic options**

I'm considering whether to include ""Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder,"" but I don't have specific medication details. Chemo could qualify, but it lacks solid evidence. I think it might be better to include ""Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood"" as an alternate option, although mixing both that and the primary mood disorders might be too similar. So, I'm settling on my draft list while ensuring that each diagnosis remains distinct and relevant, especially considering the psychological factors affecting medical conditions.

**Ranking possible diagnoses**

I’m pondering the inclusion of ""Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood"" (F43.21) but wonder if it's essential since it's a subtype. Generalized Anxiety Disorder could be a differential diagnosis, but the symptoms might not meet the 6-month requirement.

So, I’m trying to rank the top five most likely diagnoses. After reviewing, my list is shaping up, but items 2 and 4 seem to overlap. I want to ensure they're distinct, so I’ll keep refining the options!

**Finalizing diagnostic list**

I’m putting together my final list of diagnoses. Here’s what I have so far:

1. Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood - F43.23
2. Major depressive disorder, single episode, mild - F32.0
3. Other specified anxiety disorder - F41.8
4. Depressive disorder due to another medical condition - F06.31
5. Unspecified anxiety disorder - F41.9

I understand there's some overlap with anxiety disorders, but it’s important to include these distinctions. Each diagnosis reflects the user's situation and symptoms appropriately.

**Finalizing diagnostic list**

I’ve structured my final list of possible diagnoses based on the information provided. Here’s what I’ll include:

1. Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood - F43.23
2. Other specified depressive disorder (depressive episode with insufficient symptoms) - F32.8
3. Major depressive disorder, single episode, mild - F32.0
4. Other specified anxiety disorder - F41.8
5. Depressive disorder due to another medical condition - F06.31

This ranking reflects the most likely options without overlapping and prioritizes the most fitting diagnoses for the situation.

**Crafting final diagnostic list**

I need to finalize the structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses based on the evaluation. Here’s what I’ll include:

1. Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood - F43.23

1044,"Patient C is a 24 year old male with no past medical or psychiatric history who presents to an inpatient psychiatric hospital after his family filed an emergency detention order to have him hospitalized due to psychosis. The family state the patient has been steadily declining over the past 2 years. They share he was a high-achieving college student and graduated with a degree in electrical engineering. In the past 2 years, he has become more withdrawn, appears more depressed, and his hygiene has declined to the point where he no longer showers. He lost his job due to the fact he was unable to keep up with his duties. In the past 6 months, they’ve noticed the patient’s speech start to become rambled and illogical. They state “it looks like he’s talking to someone not there”. Family history is significant for schizophrenia in the patient’s paternal grandfather. On assessment with the patient, he appears internally preoccupied, withdrawn, and is difficult to engage. His speech is illogical, disorganized, and with increased latency. He is noted to be malodorous with poor hygiene. Lab work-up with CBC, CMP, thyroid panel, HIV, Syphilis, B12, and folate are negative. UDS is positive for marijuana. He is started on Risperidone. After 5 days on the medication, he is less internally preoccupied, able to state he was hearing voices that are still present, but less loud and comprehensible.

","Schizophrenia, unspecified (F20.9)",,juliana_zhang,Schizophrenia,"Schizophrenia, unspecified (F20.9)",,"**Evaluating differential diagnoses**

I'm working to narrow down the top five likely diagnoses. Schizophreniform is less likely due to duration, but I can still include it with some uncertainty. The vignette shows a 2-year decline and 6 months of psychosis, leading me to lean towards schizophrenia. Schizotypal personality disorder might come up, but the acute psychosis weakens that option. Autism spectrum disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder don’t fit either, but I might consider ""psychotic disorder due to another medical condition"" as a potential, albeit less likely, candidate.

**Choosing differential diagnoses**

I don't have a specific medical condition to work with, but the rubric suggests I identify subtle cues and produce a nuanced list of possible diagnoses. I need to narrow it down to five options. The top five I’m considering are: 

1. Schizophrenia (F20.9)  
2. Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type (F25.1)  
3. Major depressive disorder, severe with psychotic features (F32.3)  
4. Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder (F12.951)  
5. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition (F06.2).

This last one could be less likely but still worth noting, given the case features suggest primary psychosis.

**Refining diagnosis options**

I’m considering ""Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder, unspecified substance"" with code F19.959, but since we know cannabis is involved, it makes sense to specify that. I also thought about “Schizoid personality disorder” (F60.1), but that doesn’t fit since the social withdrawal seems to be illness-related. I might contemplate ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" (F32.A) due to signs of depression but feel it's insufficient. 

I want to double-check ICD-10-CM codes:  
- F20.9 for Schizophrenia, unspecified.  
- F25.1 for Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type.  
- F32.3 for Major depressive disorder, severe with psychotic features.  
- F12.951 for cannabis-induced psychotic disorder with hallucinations seems appropriate since the patient reports hearing voices.

**Defining top diagnoses**

I need to confirm that F12.951 is indeed within the F-codes, and it looks like I can label it as ""Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder,"" using that specific code. I want to avoid ""cannabis use, unspecified with psychotic disorder with hallucinations"" for labeling. 

So, I’ll stick with ""Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder with hallucinations"" (F12.951). For the fifth diagnosis, I'm considering ""Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.2). I realize there’s some nuance around this code, particularly regarding delusions and hallucinations, but the patient's symptoms suggest hallucinations more prominently.

**Assessing potential diagnoses**

I’m evaluating the diagnoses under ICD-10-CM codes. For hallucinations, F06.0 seems more accurate, but since there’s no known medical condition for the patient, I’m leaning towards ""Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.2) as a differential. However, that code implies known causes, which complicates things. 

Instead, I'll consider using ""Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder"" (F29) as an alternative since it doesn't require specifying a cause. I can also look at ""Cannabis use disorder"" since the patient is UDS positive. 

Ultimately, the top five possible diagnoses will likely include schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mood disorders with psychotic features, substance-induced psychotic disorder, and psychotic disorder due to a medical condition. These seem like the most relevant based on the symptoms presented!

**Choosing diagnoses carefully**

I’m identifying the top five psychiatric diagnoses based on the case. Schizophrenia (F20.9) is clear, while Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder (F12.951) seems plausible given the positive UDS. However, I need to be cautious about redundancy, as cannabis use may exacerbate underlying conditions rather than cause psychosis.

Next, I’m considering schizoaffective disorder (F25.1) and major depressive disorder with psychotic features (F32.3). I’m uncertain about including cannabis use disorder as a diagnosis, but it could be relevant as a comorbidity.

Ultimately, I’m aiming for clarity in my final five diagnoses while considering the nuances of the symptoms presented.

**Finalizing diagnoses list**

I need to select the most plausible diagnoses based on the data I've evaluated. Here’s my ranking:

1. Schizophrenia - F20.9
2. Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type - F25.1
3. Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe with psychotic features - F32.3
4. Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder, with hallucinations - F12.951
5. Schizophreniform disorder - F20.81

I recognize that while some conditions might seem less likely, they still need to be included as part of the required top five diagnoses.

**Deciding on plausible diagnoses**

I'm considering what diagnoses to include. It might make sense to use ""Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder - F29,"" but that's less specific since the case appears to meet schizophrenia criteria. 

However, my top five should comprise primarily supported diagnoses, including:

1. Schizophrenia - F20.9
2. Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder (cannabis) - F12.951
3. Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type - F25.1
4. Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe with psychotic features - F32.3
5. ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" could be an option too, considering the evidence presented. I need to ensure these selections fit the user's request without speculation.

**Finalizing differential diagnoses**

I’m determining the top five differential diagnoses with supporting evidence, specifically ICD-10 F-codes. Here’s what I have:

1. Schizophrenia - F20.9  
2. Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type - F25.1  
3. Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder (with hallucinations) - F12.951  
4. Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe with psychotic features - F32.3  
5. Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder - F29  

These ensure direct alignment with both DSM-5-TR criteria and relevant codes, keeping the list organized without unnecessary details.

**Finalizing likely diagnoses**

I need to refine the list of the top five most likely diagnoses. Considering specificity, I can include ""Cannabis use disorder, unspecified"" instead of unspecified psychosis, as there's a positive urine drug screen. However, diagnosing requires more context. Given the user's request for DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses, it’s important to avoid uncertainties, so I should stick with more precise terms. 

Here’s my structured list:

1. Schizophrenia - F20.9  
2. Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type - F25.1

It looks like we need to provide five likely diagnoses, including some that could be differential. It’s a bit ambiguous, but we can include DMDD and ODD even if the DSM cautions against co-diagnosing them. They didn't specifically ask for a differential diagnosis list, but their mention of building one suggests that's what they’re looking for. They want a structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses. I'll prioritize them, treating the first as primary and the others as secondary, while avoiding mutually exclusive diagnoses.

**Navigating diagnosis categories**

It seems like the term ""Secondary diagnosis"" implies comorbidity or alternatives rather than just differential diagnoses. They mention differential earlier, which adds to the confusion. I think it might be wise to treat these as differential diagnoses while acknowledging that alternatives can be treated as secondary. They're asking for the top five diagnoses, prioritizing one primary and four others, which could be differential. I’ll consider options like ODD as secondary and aims for a nuanced differential including diagnoses like PTSD, ADHD, and mood disorders. Let’s focus on the top five most likely.

**Focusing on structured diagnoses**

The question is clear: I need to read and diagnose the clinical case vignette based solely on the information given, without adding any details. I must provide a structured list of the top five most likely DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses along with their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes, which include one primary diagnosis and four secondary ones. Non-psychiatric diagnoses can’t be included, and it's important that I focus purely on the list format requested—no clinical reasoning should be included.

**Listing potential diagnoses**

I need to come up with a list of five potential diagnoses with their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes. For example, I would include Conduct Disorder (F91.2), Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (F34.81), and Cannabis Use Disorder (which could be F12.20, F12.10, or F12.90). I also want to include PTSD (F43.10) despite the lack of symptoms. Given the trauma history, I might consider using ""Unspecified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder"" (F43.9), ensuring I don't fabricate but adhere to the details provided.

**Determining primary diagnoses**

I think it’s best to focus on listing the top five most likely diagnoses with their ICD-10 F-codes, given the complexity here. 

1. Conduct disorder, adolescent-onset type - F91.2
2. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder - F34.81
3. Cannabis use disorder, possibly moderate/severe - F12.20, but perhaps we should consider mild - F12.10.
4. Oppositional defiant disorder - F91.3 
5. Posttraumatic stress disorder - F43.10 or maybe Unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder - F43.9.

I should choose the most relevant codes while ensuring adherence to the instructions by only including psychiatric diagnoses using F-codes.

**Finalizing diagnoses**

I need to evaluate the primary diagnoses carefully. At age 16, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) might still be valid, but conduct disorder (CD) seems more aligned with the current situation given the aggression and cruelty. 

I should prioritize based on severity: 

1. Conduct disorder, adolescent-onset type - F91.2
2. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder - F34.81
3. Cannabis use disorder, possibly mild - F12.10
4. Oppositional defiant disorder - F91.3
5. Posttraumatic stress disorder - F43.10, or I could opt for unspecified trauma-related - F43.9, but the evidence leans towards DMDD and CD as the main issues.

**Deciding on diagnoses**

I’m trying to finalize the list of diagnoses. Conduct disorder seems to be the primary diagnosis due to aggressive behavior, with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder as a secondary option. Cannabis use disorder is possible, but I need to decide between moderate or unspecified. 

PTSD could also be included, but I wonder if we should incorporate something like unspecified trauma-related disorder instead. We can include oppositional defiant disorder too. Here's the final list:

1. Conduct disorder, adolescent-onset - F91.2
2. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder - F34.81
3. Cannabis use disorder - F12.20
4. Posttraumatic stress disorder - F43.10
5. Oppositional defiant disorder - F91.3

**Refining the diagnosis list**

I’m considering whether to include oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) with PTSD in the top diagnoses. PTSD may not be likely since we lack symptoms, making unspecified trauma-related disorder (F43.9) a better fit. 

I’m also thinking about cannabis use disorder; it seems probable based on the user’s daily use but I’m unsure if the criteria can be fully met. I’ll list:

1. Conduct disorder, adolescent-onset type - F91.2
2. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder - F34.81
3. Cannabis use disorder - F12.20
4. Posttraumatic stress disorder - F43.10
5. Oppositional defiant disorder - F91.3 

Although the inclusion of ODD alongside DMDD may complicate things.

**Finalizing the diagnosis list**

I’m deliberating between several possible diagnoses. For this case, conduct disorder seems primary since the patient shows patterns of aggression and rule-breaking. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) follows, but I must consider whether to include oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) as it cannot co-occur with DMDD.

I plan to present:

1. Conduct disorder, adolescent-onset type - F91.2
2. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder - F34.81
3. Cannabis use disorder, moderate to severe - F12.20
4. Posttraumatic stress disorder - F43.10
5. Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder - F43.8 

This way, I avoid conflicts while addressing the patient's symptoms and history.

**Deciding on diagnoses**

I'm weighing various possible diagnoses and narrowing it down. I consider conduct disorder as primary, given the pattern of aggression, while oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) is a secondary option. Cannabis use disorder follows, but I need to ensure I balance the list.

For clarity, I’m leaning towards:

1. Conduct disorder, adolescent-onset type - F91.2
2. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder - F34.81 
3. Cannabis use disorder, moderate - F12.20 
4. Posttraumatic stress disorder - F43.10 
5. Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder - F43.8 

However, I know I can only include diagnoses that don’t conflict with each other, so I’ll finalize this carefully.

**Finalizing diagnoses**

I'm working through the top 5 diagnoses based on the limited information available. Given the context, I think it's acceptable to consider both ODD and DMDD as differentials. For the structured list, I aim to deliver the following:

1. Conduct disorder, adolescent-onset type - F91.2
2. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder - F34.81
3. Cannabis use disorder, moderate - F12.20
4. Posttraumatic stress disorder - F43.10
5. Oppositional defiant disorder - F91.3

This framing respects DSM rules while fitting the user's request, even considering potential trauma-related aspects, and maintaining a clear numbering format.

**Finalizing the diagnoses**

I'm focusing on delivering a structured list of five diagnoses. I'm settling on the following:

1. Conduct disorder, adolescent-onset type - F91.2  
2. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder - F34.81  
3. Cannabis use disorder, moderate - F12.20

When asked if she has ever had periods of abnormally elated mood or irritability, she notes that about 1 month ago she had a period where she felt “extremely happy”. States that she felt “the complete opposite” of how she felt currently. States this period lasted for approximately 5 days and she was “so so happy”. She also felt extremely productive during this time, cleaning her entire house in an evening, and that she was able to “take on more projects at work”. She also notes that she had increased energy, needing to only sleep about 2-3 hours a night during that time and feeling “amazing”. She has tried Zoloft in the past but discontinued the medication because it made her feel “hyper”. She currently is not taking any psychiatric medication. She has never been psychiatrically hospitalized before.",Bipolar disorder with current depressed episode (F31.3),,juliana_zhang,Bipolar depression,Bipolar disorder with current depressed episode (F31.3),,"**Identifying likely diagnoses**

The requirement is to provide the top 5 most likely diagnoses: one primary and four secondary. I think I could list:

1. Bipolar II disorder - F31.81
2. Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode, unspecified - F33.9
3. Unspecified bipolar and related disorder - F31.9
4. Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar and Related Disorder - needs the right F code.
5. Unspecified anxiety disorder - F41.9

I need to ensure I find the correct code for the substance/medication-induced bipolar disorder, as it depends on the specific substance involved.

**Clarifying mood disorder diagnoses**

I’m considering that this mood disorder might be related to a known physiological condition, and there's the code ""F15.14"" for certain cases. Since SSRIs don’t fit this, I think I can exclude those. Alternatively, I could use ""Other specified bipolar and related disorder"" F31.89 as a differential for antidepressant-induced mood episodes. If medication-induced mania falls under the substance/med-induced category, I can still consider these alternatives. Also, I should keep in mind the implications of hypomania and the distinctions in the DSM regarding bipolar II disorder and major depressive disorder.

**Assessing depressive symptoms**

The patient experienced being ""hyper"" on Zoloft, which could be a side effect, but it's unclear. She had a 5-day happiness phase while off meds about a month ago, indicating that mood elevation might be independent of medication. For her current major depressive episode, she shows 5 symptoms over 3 weeks and hasn't reported suicidal ideation, agitation, appetite issues, sleep disturbances, or weight changes. Since she meets the DSM criteria, I’ll conclude that her primary diagnosis is bipolar II disorder with a current major depressive episode.

**Listing secondary diagnoses**

I need to provide four plausible secondary diagnoses. While I can mention the current major depressive episode related to bipolar II disorder, that isn't separate. The instructions suggest not to include specifiers, so I’ll focus on DSM diagnoses with codes. Maybe I should consider comorbidities, like generalized anxiety disorder, based on her past history. 

To be safe, I won't mention specifiers explicitly, but for MDD differential, I could list ""Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode"" as a possibility.

**Verifying diagnosis codes**

I need to verify the following diagnosis codes:

1. Bipolar II disorder, current episode depressed - F31.81
2. Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode, unspecified - F33.9
3. Unspecified bipolar and related disorder - F31.9
4. Other specified bipolar and related disorder - F31.89
5. Unspecified anxiety disorder - F41.9

I’m considering the patient’s past psychiatric history. While I wonder about the recurrent specification, I’m choosing F33.9 to reflect her history of depression while ensuring the format is precise with no additional commentary.","1. Bipolar II disorder (current episode depressed) - F31.81

1047,"Patient F is a 37 year old male with past medical history of hypertension and past psychiatric history of substance use disorder (marijuana, methamphetamine) and psychosis who presents after being brought in by police to the ED for aggression. The patient was reportedly at a gas station causing a disturbance, speaking about how everyone in there was the devil and throwing items off the shelves. When officers arrived, the patient was aggressive and had to be tased. On arrival, the patient had to receive emergency IM medications of Haldol, Ativan, and Benadryl due to agitation. Psychiatry was consulted for psychosis. On psychiatric assessment, the patient is drowsy after having just received the emergency IM medications. However, he is irritable and hostile, telling the physician to “fuck off” and that “the devil is out to get you”. He states he is “like a God” and that he was unfairly arrested. On chart review, he has a history of being prescribed antipsychotics, but currently pt denies taking any psychiatric medications. Assessment was limited due to the patient’s lack of engagement and hostility. Lab work was significant for UDS positive for marijuana, methamphetamine, and PCP. He started on a low-dose of scheduled Risperidone. The next day, he was reassessed by psychiatry. He is less hostile, but still irritable and asks if he can sleep. On limited assessment, pt denied thinking the devil was after him and did not make any grandiose statements about him being God. He did not appear internally preoccupied but was very sleepy. He was later assessed in the afternoon after he was repotedly asking to leave. He denied suicidal ideations, homicidal ideations, or auditory/visual hallucinations. While he was still irritable, he was more cooperative and states he does not recall being at a gas station. He does endorse to using marijuana, methamphetamine, and PCP “for 2 days straight”. He is currently homeless and wants to go to the shelter. He denies paranoia or any belief that he is God, states “that’s ridiculous” when asked that question.

I'm looking at various substance codes related to stimulant abuse and dependence. There's a difference between F15.150 for abuse and F15.250 for dependence. Since the patient's history includes substance use disorder but lacks clear dependence criteria, we might have to consider the unspecified coding for DSM. Alternatively, I could opt for F19.159, which addresses unspecified psychoactive substance-induced psychotic disorder. The simplest path might be to use the general code for ""Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder"" without tying it to abuse or dependence. However, there’s still uncertainty about the appropriate ICD-10 coding.

**Choosing substance codes**

I think it’s best to select codes that align with DSM-5-TR and are well-recognized. F19.959 for ""Other psychoactive substance-induced psychotic disorder, unspecified"" seems like a contender. However, we're generally after any F-code that’s appropriate while avoiding clearly incorrect ones.

In my previous interactions, I’ve noted, for example, F15.959 for methamphetamine-induced psychosis and F12.150 for cannabis-induced psychotic disorder. Given the psychoactive substances involved, I might lean towards F19.959 again. But, we could also diagnose as ""Other stimulant-induced psychotic disorder, with delusions,"" using F15.150 or F15.151. Let's also consider the urine results: marijuana, methamphetamine, and PCP; the psychosis here includes delusions that are persecutory and religious, which aligns with what PCP and meth can cause.

**Deciding on diagnoses and codes**

I’m considering ""Phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder, with delusions,"" since PCP often results in acute psychosis, which can include agitation and violence. However, with the patient using multiple substances for two days, isolating one substance is tricky. 

It might be better to go with ""Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder"" due to the involvement of various substances. I’m thinking of using F19.150 for that. Given the positive meth result and the patient's history, we could specify it’s due to methamphetamine and PCP. 

For secondary diagnoses, I'll need to provide additional ones like stimulant use disorder for methamphetamine, coded as F15.20 for moderate/severe or F15.10 for mild. The patient's past history of substance use disorder supports this diagnosis, though the precise severity is unspecified.

**Considering substance use disorder coding**

In DSM-5-TR, severity for use disorder is classified as mild (2-3 criteria), moderate (4-5), or severe (6+). Without detailed information, I might have to label it ""Stimulant use disorder, unspecified severity."" DSM does allow for unspecified severity, and I could consider using F15.20, which indicates moderate to severe. F15.10 is for mild, but that might not accurately reflect the patient’s situation.

I’m leaning towards ""Stimulant use disorder (amphetamine-type), unspecified,"" and coding it as F15.90. This code refers to ""Other stimulant use, unspecified, uncomplicated,"" which doesn't specifically denote abuse or dependence, making it a broad option that many tasks accept.

**Determining the right diagnosis and coding**

PCP intoxication can cause psychotic symptoms, but ""substance-induced psychotic disorder"" is typically diagnosed when symptoms persist beyond typical intoxication and are more pronounced. In this case, symptoms seem to resolve within 24 hours, suggesting intoxication instead. 

While DSM-5 allows for unspecified severity, using codes like F19.150 for ""Other psychoactive substance abuse with psychotic disorder with delusions"" might apply. There’s also the option to specify stimulant use disorder based on the substance use history. Since the patient has acute psychosis due to polysubstance use, I would lean toward coding it as ""Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder, with delusions (polysubstance: methamphetamine/PCP)"" using F19.150. Finally, ensuring accurate ICD-10 coding is essential, with multiple codes potentially valid depending on the specifics of the diagnosis.

**Assessing substance use disorders**

For substance use disorders, I've noted various codes. For cannabis use disorder, there are codes for mild (F12.10), moderate/severe (F12.20), and unspecified (F12.90). For stimulant and hallucinogen use disorders, we have similar coding options. Given the patient’s multiple substance use and associated symptoms, I could list five diagnoses. This might include ""Other psychoactive substance-induced psychotic disorder"" and specify stimulant and cannabis use disorders. However, distinguishing between the effects of meth and PCP can be tricky. Ultimately, aligning with DSM-5 and ICD-10 classifications is key when determining the most accurate coding.

**Evaluating substance-induced diagnoses**

I’m trying to clarify the patient’s situation regarding potential diagnoses related to substance use. Without physical signs for intoxication with stimulants or PCP, it's tough to confirm that status. However, we can diagnose use disorders since those don’t require physical signs. The patient has a history of stimulant and cannabis use disorder, likely active due to recent use. I could consider diagnoses like ""Stimulant-induced psychotic disorder"" and ""Other hallucinogen use disorder,"" but we need to ensure that any diagnosis is well-supported by the evidence available.

**Clarifying diagnoses and codes**

I'm evaluating the patient's situation involving potential diagnoses related to substances. The PCP screens can yield false positives, but the patient admitted recent use. Improvement is noted, with a lack of delusions after 24 hours. I’m considering diagnoses: polysubstance-induced psychotic disorder with delusions, unspecified stimulant and cannabis use disorders, and possibly hallucinogen use disorder. I want to ensure we reference DSM-5 terminology and code accurately, focusing on ""Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder (polysubstance)"" with the correct classification. It’s important to be precise in diagnosing and coding!

**Deciding on diagnoses and codes**

I'm working through the appropriate diagnoses and code selections for the patient. For polysubstance use causing psychotic disorder, I lean towards F19.950, reflecting unspecified use with psychotic disorder marked by delusions. I'm cautious about labeling abuse or dependence because those specifics are unclear. The history of substance use suggests potential severity, but I prefer to stick with unspecified codes. For the fifth diagnosis, while ""Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder"" could apply given the history, I have to be careful in how I approach that distinction to avoid conflict with substance-induced psychosis.

**Choosing appropriate diagnoses**

I’m considering whether ""Other stimulant-induced bipolar and related disorder"" fits due to grandiosity and irritability, but there aren't enough mania symptoms to fully support it. I might lean toward ""Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar and Related Disorder"" for differential, but without enough supporting evidence for mania, it feels less likely.

For my final diagnosis list: I might go with ""Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder with delusions"" indicating polysubstance use. I also need to consider ""Schizophrenia"" or “Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder” based on past psychosis and antipsychotic use history, while ensuring not to overspecify use disorders.

**Compiling diagnoses list**

I’m looking at whether to include ""Other psychoactive substance use disorder"" for polysubstance use, but I need to focus on identifying the top diagnoses based on the case's specifics. The list currently includes:

1. Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder with delusions (F19.950).
2. Other Stimulant Use Disorder (methamphetamine) (F15.90).
3. Cannabis Use Disorder (F12.90).
4. Hallucinogen Use Disorder (phencyclidine) (F16.90).
5. Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder (F29).

I’m confirming that F29 represents the unspecified psychosis not due to a substance, which fits well without the need for “rule out” wording. This seems solid for the final output.

**Finalizing diagnosis codes**

I’m confirming the codes for cannabis and stimulant use disorders. For unspecified cannabis use disorder, the code is F12.90, and for unspecified stimulant use disorder, it's F15.90. I need to check that F19.950, which refers to ""Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder with delusions,"" is correct since it fits the case involving multiple substances. 

I’ll finalize the top five diagnoses as: 

1. Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder, with delusions - F19.950
2. Other Stimulant Use Disorder (methamphetamine), unspecified - F15.90
3. Cannabis Use Disorder, unspecified - F12.90

1048,"Patient G is a 29 year old male with no past medical or psychiatric history who presents to his PCP for problems with sleep. The patient was discharged from the military 1 year ago after sustaining a combat-related injury while in Afghanistan. Since returning, he has been unable to sleep at night. He states he has difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep. He states he has recurring nightmares of what he witnessed while he was in Afghanistan, and these prevent him from sleeping. He also endorses avoidance of any loud noises such as fireworks as it triggers memories for him. He endorses hyper vigilance and always feels like he has to be aware of his surroundings. He states his mood has been “mad” and that he’s “always angry” for no reason and that this has caused difficulties between him and his wife.

I need to provide the top 5 DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses along with their ICD-10 F-codes for a 29-year-old male with a combat-related injury from Afghanistan. His main issues include insomnia, nightmares, hypervigilance, anger, guilt, marital problems, and alcohol use. The most likely diagnosis is PTSD, which corresponds to ICD-10 code F43.10. If chronic, it would be F43.12, but DSM-5 doesn't distinguish. The secondary diagnosis is Alcohol Use Disorder, likely moderate to severe.

**Determining alcohol and insomnia diagnoses**

First, I’ll code F10.20 for alcohol dependence, which is considered uncomplicated. The DSM-5 classifies ""Alcohol Use Disorder"" as moderate to severe, and clinicians often use F10.20 for these cases. Given the user's daily intake of six beers and need to cope, I’ll confirm F10.20 as the appropriate code.

For insomnia, while it's likely secondary to PTSD, I can list ""Insomnia Disorder"" as F51.01, which is primary insomnia. If it’s due to a mental disorder, F51.05 could apply, but I’ll stick to F51.01 since that’s what was specifically requested.

**Listing psychiatric diagnoses**

I could list ""Insomnia Disorder"" because of the PTSD, but symptoms need to be clinically significant beyond that to be separate. I might include it as ""Insomnia Disorder (comorbid)."" 

Another consideration is Major Depressive Disorder; while the individual has feelings of anger and guilt, there aren’t enough symptoms to confirm it. I think “Other Specified Depressive Disorder” or “Depressive Disorder, Unspecified” (F32.A) fits better. 

Lastly, since this person smokes about a pack a day, they qualify for ""Tobacco Use Disorder"" with the ICD-10 code F17.210 for nicotine dependence.

**Identifying additional diagnoses**

I could consider ""Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder,"" but since the individual meets the full criteria for PTSD, that’s the primary diagnosis. He has symptoms like intrusive nightmares, avoidance behavior, and persistent negative beliefs, along with hypervigilance. 

Next, the top diagnoses include Alcohol Use Disorder, Nicotine Use Disorder, and Insomnia Disorder due to PTSD. I might also include ""Nightmare Disorder"" (F51.5) as a secondary condition. 

Lastly, I could consider ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder"" (F41.1), but I'm still determining its relevance.

**Finalizing diagnoses for the case**

I’m working on the top five psychiatric diagnoses based on the provided vignette. The primary diagnosis is PTSD (F43.10). 

For secondary conditions, I can include:  
1. Alcohol Use Disorder (F10.20, moderate/severe)  
2. Tobacco Use Disorder, nicotine dependence (F17.210)  
3. Insomnia Disorder due to another mental disorder (F51.05)  
4. Nightmare Disorder (F51.5)  

I want to ensure everything fits the criteria and maintains proper F-codes. Though we discussed several options, these seem to align best with the case details.

**Finalizing F-codes for diagnoses**

I’m focusing on providing the necessary F-codes for the user's request. The main diagnoses are:

1. Posttraumatic stress disorder - F43.10
2. Alcohol use disorder, uncomplicated - F10.20
3. Nicotine dependence, cigarettes - F17.210
4. Insomnia disorder due to other mental disorder - F51.05
5. Nightmare disorder - F51.5

These choices reflect the user's need for clear, structured information without additional reasoning. I'm confident this aligns with the information provided!

**Finalizing the F-coded diagnoses**

I'm compiling the requested diagnoses with their corresponding F-codes. Here’s my structure:

1. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) - F43.10
2. Alcohol use disorder - F10.20
3. Tobacco use disorder (nicotine dependence) - F17.210
4. Nightmare disorder - F51.5
5. Insomnia disorder - F51.01

I believe these choices align with the user's requirements for DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses while ensuring they all have appropriate F-codes. This should cover their request adequately!

**Determining the top diagnoses**

I'm considering whether to include ""Insomnia disorder"" with code F51.01 since the patient experiences insomnia linked to nightmares and hypervigilance. However, DSM-5 allows for insomnia to be comorbid with PTSD. Since nightmares are clearly trauma-related, a separate diagnosis for nightmare disorder may not be necessary. So, for the top five diagnoses, I’m sticking with PTSD, alcohol use disorder, tobacco use disorder, insomnia disorder, and unspecified depressive disorder. This feels like a well-rounded list!

**Finalizing the top diagnoses**

The user has asked for the top five most likely diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes. I think it's best to include PTSD as the primary diagnosis and then four secondary ones. I’ve decided on: 

1. Posttraumatic stress disorder - F43.10 
2. Alcohol use disorder, severe - F10.20 
3. Tobacco use disorder (nicotine dependence, cigarettes) - F17.210 
4. Insomnia disorder - F51.01 
5. Unspecified depressive disorder - F32.9 

This seems to cover the necessary bases and fits within their requested framework!

**Determining the top diagnoses**

I'm evaluating the best diagnoses to include, focusing especially on F51.01 (insomnia disorder) and possibly F51.5 (nightmare disorder). It seems his recurring nightmares are part of PTSD, which could lead to insomnia. 

However, the PTSD symptoms may overshadow the necessity for insomnia or nightmare disorder as separate diagnoses. Ultimately, I'll proceed with PTSD as the primary diagnosis and include alcohol and tobacco use as significant comorbidities. 

The top five likely diagnoses I’ll list are:

1. Posttraumatic stress disorder - F43.10 
2. Alcohol use disorder - F10.20 
3. Tobacco use disorder - F17.210 
4. Insomnia disorder - F51.01 
5. Unspecified depressive disorder - F32.9

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

I'm evaluating the diagnosis list for this case. Nightmare disorder could be an option, but PTSD explains the symptoms quite well. It's also possible to consider ""Alcohol-induced sleep disorder,"" but it isn't specifically described. 

Ultimately, I'll prioritize PTSD and include significant substance use disorders. The top five likely diagnoses are:

1. Posttraumatic stress disorder - F43.10
2. Alcohol use disorder - F10.20
3. Tobacco use disorder - F17.210
4. Insomnia disorder - F51.01
5. Unspecified depressive disorder - F32.9 

This should cover the user's request effectively!

**Compiling top diagnoses**

Let's finalize the list of diagnoses based on the case. I’m including ""Alcohol use disorder"" and ""Tobacco use disorder"" since they are relevant. For insomnia, I'll label it as ""Insomnia disorder."" I’ve made sure to adhere to DSM criteria.

Here’s the final list:

",Cataonia associated with another mental disorder (F06.1),,juliana_zhang,Catatonia,Cataonia associated with another mental disorder (F06.1),,"**Considering top diagnoses**

The question asks for the top five diagnoses, starting with a primary one and four secondary ones. I’m thinking of suggesting ""Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe, with catatonic features"" for the primary diagnosis. But is there a better way to frame it? Maybe I should note ""Catatonia associated with major depressive disorder"" as primary. Given her history and current symptoms, I must consider catatonia's possible causes too, including conditions like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. So my top diagnoses list may include catatonia linked to another mental disorder, MDD, and schizophrenia.

**Evaluating potential diagnoses**

I'm considering several options for diagnoses. For the fourth, could ""Bipolar I disorder, current episode depressed, severe with catatonia"" work? But, hmm, there's no history of mania. My fifth option might be ""Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition,"" yet that shares the same code as a previous diagnosis. I’ll need unique diagnoses, so I can list ""Catatonia associated with major depressive disorder,"" ""Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe,"" ""Schizoaffective disorder,"" ""Schizophrenia,"" and possibly ""Brief psychotic disorder with catatonia."" It's tricky balancing these F-codes!

**Considering differential diagnoses**

I’m weighing several differential diagnoses here. Options include ""Schizophrenia,"" ""Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type,"" and ""Bipolar I disorder, current episode depressed, severe."" But there's no indication of mania or hypomania. Should I consider ""Depressive disorder due to another medical condition with catatonic features""? That’s tricky since we lack a medical condition context. I might also add ""Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum"" and ""Brief psychotic disorder."" Given her history, what about ""Major depressive disorder, recurrent""? It might be complicated, considering her treatment history with Zoloft.

**Prioritizing diagnoses**

It seems like the recurrent diagnosis is more likely, so I’ll prioritize my top five diagnoses. I could list ""Catatonia associated with major depressive disorder"" as number one (F06.1), followed by ""Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe, with catatonic features"" (F33.2). Next would be ""Schizophrenia"" (F20.9), then ""Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type"" (F25.1). Lastly, I'll include ""Bipolar I disorder, current episode depressed, severe"" (F31.4). I must ensure the codes align with DSM-5-TR/ICD-10 standards.

**Determining key diagnoses**

I’m analyzing how to structure my diagnoses list based on the case details. The primary diagnosis might be ""Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe, with catatonic features"" (F33.2). For secondary diagnoses, I can add ""Catatonia associated with another mental disorder"" (F06.1) and ""Schizophrenia"" (F20.9). ""Bipolar I disorder, current episode depressed, severe"" (F31.4) could fit, along with ""Brief psychotic disorder with catatonia"" (F23) or ""Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type"" (F25.1). It’s important to avoid code duplicates, so I’ll ensure each has a unique F-code while prioritizing the most relevant diagnoses.

**Clarifying primary and secondary diagnoses**

I’m sorting through the possible primary and secondary diagnoses for this case and realizing we have five strong candidates already: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) F33.2, Catatonia associated with another mental disorder F06.1, Schizophrenia F20.9, Schizoaffective depressive type F25.1, and Bipolar I disorder, current episode depressed, severe F31.4.

Since they want the top five diagnoses with corresponding F-codes, I need to make sure the primary diagnosis is distinct. Catatonia should be assessed in context—possibly as primary. The vignette indicates significant catatonia, and we can list it as a provisional diagnosis alongside MDD, highlighting the unique aspects of the patient’s presentation.

**Determining final diagnoses**

I’m working through how to list the top five diagnoses for the case. I could select ""Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, severe with catatonic features"" as the primary diagnosis (F33.2) and then consider secondary diagnoses like ""Catatonia associated with another mental disorder"" (F06.1), ""Schizophrenia"" (F20.9), ""Bipolar I disorder, current episode depressed"" (F31.4), and maybe a placeholder for another condition.

It's essential to make sure they are unique and relevant, especially since I can’t repeat codes. The focus should be on capturing the most likely diagnoses based on the vignette provided.

**Listing potential diagnoses**

I’m considering a primary diagnosis of ""Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, severe, with catatonic features"" (F33.2). For secondary diagnoses, I could include ""Catatonia associated with another mental disorder"" (F06.1) since it reflects the catatonia aspect. I also want to consider ""Schizophrenia"" (F20.9) and ""Bipolar I disorder, current episode depressed, severe, with catatonic features"" (F31.4). 

I’m thinking through which codes are fitting while keeping in mind the user’s request for a clear top 5 list. It’s crucial I don’t repeat codes!

I’m considering the situation closely: the patient might have Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with catatonia, which is a primary candidate. I need to check codes like F33.2 for recurrent severe MDD. However, I'm also debating if catatonia could be associated with another mental disorder (F06.1) since she exhibits bizarre behavior and catatonic features. I wonder if ""Catatonia associated with another mental disorder"" should be the primary diagnosis. 

I need to ensure I list five unique, appropriate diagnoses while also reflecting the complex presentation. This requires balancing the need for accuracy without redundancy.

**Considering catatonia and mood disorders**

I’m weighing the primary diagnosis options: either ""Catatonia associated with major depressive disorder"" or ""Major depressive disorder with catatonic features."" The patient is mute, exhibits stupor, has waxy flexibility, and hasn’t eaten, which all suggest severe mood disorder is likely. However, I’m uncertain if she meets the criteria for a major depressive episode since we lack some mood symptoms.

Given her history, I think ""Unspecified catatonia - F06.1"" could be the safest primary diagnosis, listing MDD and other differentials afterward for clarity. I’ll ensure to provide accurate ICD-10 codes for each diagnosis in my final list!

**Deciding on diagnoses**

I’m working through the primary and secondary diagnoses for this case. If I list major depressive disorder (MDD) and catatonia, I need to be careful to have three more differential diagnoses. Comorbidities count too, so I’ll aim to include that.

I’m leaning towards making the primary diagnosis ""MDD with catatonic features"" since that addresses catatonia as a specifier. Then, I’ll consider secondary diagnoses like ""Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition,"" schizophrenia, bipolar I, and schizoaffective disorder. It’s important I’m thorough in my final list and use accurate F-codes!

**Determining diagnoses**

I'm weighing the best diagnoses for this case, considering she stopped Zoloft six months ago, which could lead to depression. However, there aren't explicit mood symptoms noted, likely due to her catatonia. 

For the primary diagnosis, I’m thinking ""Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, severe, with catatonic features"" (F33.2) makes sense due to her history. Then I need four secondary options, which could include ""Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.1), schizophrenia (F20.9), bipolar I (F31.4), and possibly schizoaffective disorder (F25.1). This gives a solid structure while keeping the likelihood of each diagnosis in mind!

**Refining diagnoses**

I'm considering the appropriate diagnoses, starting with the possibility of ""Bipolar Disorder."" However, she's been on antidepressants without indications of mania, which suggests bipolar isn't likely. Next up is ""Catatonia due to a medical condition,"" which is essential to rule out.

For the secondary diagnoses, I think I can list: ""Catatonia associated with another mental disorder"" (F06.1), ""Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe"" (F33.2), ""Bipolar I disorder"" (F31.4), ""Schizophrenia"" (F20.9), and perhaps I should reconsider using a different code for the medical catatonia to avoid duplicates. I’ll finalize these to meet the requirements!

**Finalizing the diagnosis list**

I’m considering the instructions about not including non-psychiatric diagnoses. So, cataronia due to medical condition is still valid. They likely want ""Catatonia"" as a primary diagnosis, but I’m thinking maybe it should be combined with MDD as a secondary. 

My current thoughts for the top five diagnoses are:  
1. Catatonia associated with major depressive disorder (F06.1)  
2. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe, with catatonic features (F33.2)  
3. Schizophrenia (F20.9)  
4. Bipolar I disorder, current episode depressed, severe (F31.4)  
5. Delirium due to another medical condition (F05).  

I’m really honing in on this!

**Choosing the right diagnoses**

I need to ensure I’m using only F codes in my diagnoses. For major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe without psychotic features, I’d use F33.2. Catatonia associated with another disorder would be F06.1. I’m deciding on the primary diagnosis, considering that major depressive disorder with catatonic features might be more fitting given the context.

So, my final choices could be:  
1. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe with catatonic features - F33.2  
2. Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition - F06.1  
3. Schizophrenia - F20.9  
4. Bipolar I disorder, current episode depressed - F31.4  
5. Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type - F25.1 

I think this covers a comprehensive range!

**Refining the diagnosis list**

I want to determine the top five diagnoses. I'll consider various possibilities for diagnosing catatonia. The primary diagnosis could be ""Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe, with catatonic features"" - F33.2. For secondaries, I could include ""Catatonia due to another medical condition"" - F06.1, ""Bipolar I disorder, current episode depressed"" - F31.4, and ""Schizophrenia"" - F20.9. As an option for the fifth, I'll consider ""Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe, with psychotic features"" - F33.3. This gives a balanced view of the key conditions represented.

**Finalizing diagnosis codes**

I need to establish the top five diagnoses for the case at hand. First, I could list ""Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe, with catatonic features"" - F33.2 as primary. I’ll also include ""Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition"" - F06.1, ""Schizophrenia"" - F20.9, ""Bipolar I disorder, current episode depressed, severe"" - F31.4, and I’m considering ""Brief psychotic disorder"" - F23 for a fifth. While I can't confirm psychotic symptoms due to mutism, I'll still list schizophrenia as a differential.

**Determining primary diagnosis**

I think the most accurate primary diagnosis here is ""Unspecified catatonia"" (F06.1), which fits given the lack of details about the underlying disorder. I might consider ""Catatonia associated with major depressive disorder"" as the primary as well, recognizing the patient's history. However, diagnosing major depressive disorder as recurrent could require inferring depressive symptoms not explicitly stated. I need to ensure a well-structured list that includes unique diagnoses and their corresponding codes, aiming for clarity in presenting the information.

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

I’m working on a structured list of diagnoses. The first could be ""Catatonia associated with another mental disorder"" (likely major depressive disorder, F06.1). Then, I'd follow with ""Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe"" (F33.2), and ""Bipolar I disorder, current episode depressed, severe"" (F31.4). I need to add ""Schizophrenia"" (F20.9) and ""Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.1), but considering duplicates is a challenge. I'll aim for unique entries while maintaining clarity.

**Structuring the diagnosis list**

I’m considering the most accurate list of diagnoses based on the patient's presentation. I could go with ""Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe, with catatonic features"" (F33.2) as primary. Then, I might include ""Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.1), ""Bipolar I disorder, current episode depressed, severe"" (F31.4), ""Schizophrenia"" (F20.9), and perhaps ""Schizophreniform disorder"" (F20.81) as secondary. However, I want unique codes and to avoid duplicates, so I need to choose carefully while ensuring clinical accuracy.

**Crafting the diagnosis list**

I’m trying to determine the best list of diagnoses for this patient. It seems appropriate to prioritize ""Catatonia associated with another mental disorder"" (F06.1), and I could use ""Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe, with catatonic features"" (F33.2) as a possible secondary. I want to ensure there are unique codes, but duplicates might be acceptable in this context. It looks like I’ll end up listing ""Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.1) again. Let’s finalize this and keep it organized.

**Determining unique codes for diagnoses**

I need to ensure that I’m providing unique F-codes as the user requested. For this case, I’ll choose ""Unspecified catatonia"" (F06.1) as the primary diagnosis. Next, I'll include ""Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe"" (F33.2), ""Bipolar I disorder, current episode depressed, severe"" (F31.4), and ""Schizophrenia"" (F20.9). For the fifth diagnosis, I might go with ""Other specified dissociative disorder (dissociative stupor)"" (F44.89) since it remains plausible, even though it’s obscure. This way, I'll have five unique and relevant codes!

**Organizing differential diagnoses**

I’m considering treating the five key diagnoses as differentials rather than comorbidities. I think the best choice for the primary diagnosis is ""Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe, with catatonic features"" (F33.2). Then for differentials, I’ll include ""Bipolar I disorder, current episode depressed"" (F31.4), ""Schizophrenia with catatonic features"" (F20.9), ""Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.1), and ""Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type"" (F25.1). This list allows for unique codes and maintains clinical relevance!

**Choosing primary diagnoses**

I’m thinking it might be best to list ""Catatonia associated with major depressive disorder"" as the primary diagnosis, which captures the key issue. For the secondary diagnoses, I’d include ""Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe"" (F33.2), ""Bipolar I disorder, current episode depressed"" (F31.4), ""Schizophrenia"" (F20.9), and ""Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type"" (F25.1). This gives me a clear set of unique codes while emphasizing the importance of diagnosing catatonia accurately within the context of mood disorders.

**Determining primary diagnoses**

I'm sorting through the potential diagnoses, leaning toward ""Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe, with catatonic features"" as my primary choice. Next, I'll list ""Bipolar I disorder, current episode depressed, severe,"" followed by ""Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition,"" ""Schizophrenia,"" and ""Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type."" I want to make sure I'm reflecting probability correctly; it seems medical catatonia is important but less likely in this case. So, I'll confirm the order based on the most likely diagnoses.

**Finalizing diagnostic considerations**

I'm considering our top diagnoses and trying to determine the best ordering. I need to keep ""Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe, with catatonic features"" as a primary choice alongside ""Catatonia associated with another mental disorder."" We need to be careful about including duplicates like ""catatonic disorder due to another medical condition."" I’ll also weigh the likelihood of each diagnosis carefully since the instructions emphasize the top 5 most likely diagnoses, ensuring I also consider the implications of any medical conditions without definitive evidence.

**Determining final diagnoses**

I'm finalizing the diagnoses for a patient in catatonia with a history of major depressive disorder (MDD). I’m thinking the primary diagnosis should be ""Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe, with catatonic features."" For the secondaries, I'm considering options like catatonic disorder due to a medical condition, bipolar I disorder, schizophrenia, and possibly other dissociative disorders. It's tricky since I want to avoid duplicates and ensure the list reflects the most likely scenarios based on the presented information. It's been a lot to consider, but I think I have the order planned out!

**Finalizing diagnoses order**

I’m reconsidering the order of diagnoses. I think the primary should be ""Major depressive disorder with catatonia,"" followed by ""bipolar I disorder with depression,"" then ""catatonic disorder due to another medical condition,"" followed by ""schizophrenia,"" and lastly ""schizoaffective disorder."" It’s essential that this list reflects the likelihood based on the patient’s history, symptoms, and current condition. I’m double-checking the codes for accuracy and ensuring the final output follows the specified format. Here’s the finalized list!","1. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe, with catatonic features - F33.2  
2. Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition - F06.1

1050,"Patient I is a 25 year old male with past medical history of hypertension and past psychiatric history of psychosis who presents to a psychiatric clinic for an initial evaluation due to hearing voices. The patient shares that he has been hearing voices for about 1 year. They initially started as incomprehensible whispers but have gradually become louder and more comprehensible. He states sometimes they will be bothersome and make negative remarks about him. He also states he has been isolating himself more and while he previously enjoyed spending time with his friends, he now has no desire to. He currently moved back in with his parents after being laid off from his job as an accountant due to missing multiple days of work unexcused. He denies any depression currently. When asked if he’s ever had episodes of an elated mood or irritability, he does state there was a period in the past year where he felt very happy. He says during this time he didn’t need to sleep as much, maybe 3-4 hours a night, had more energy, was productive, more sociable, and felt more motivated than before. He says people told him that he was “completely different” and people had a hard time understanding his speech, asking him to slow down. He says that lasted for a “couple weeks” and then it “went away”. He was still hearing voices at that time. His speech is tangential at times and he appears internally preoccupied. Hygiene is poor.","Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type (F25.0)",,juliana_zhang,"Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type","Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type (F25.0)",,"**Evaluating mood disorders and criteria**

I'm considering how mood episode criteria relate to diagnosing bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. DSM suggests that if both are present and the episodes are distinct, one might still diagnose. However, it seems mania can't be part of schizophrenia, but it might indicate a separate bipolar disorder. The key distinction is that mood episodes should be brief compared to the duration of schizophrenia's active phases. If the full criteria don't apply, coding could lean toward ""unspecified bipolar and related disorder.""

**Assessing diagnoses for mental health**

I'm thinking about treating mania as ""Bipolar I disorder, current or most recent episode manic, with psychotic features"" as the primary diagnosis. However, if psychosis happens outside mood episodes, it gets complicated. If the person isn't currently symptomatic but is still hearing voices, it might be residual effects from a past episode. Since schizophrenia typically means persistent symptoms outside episodes, my primary diagnosis could lean towards schizophrenia, with bipolar disorder as a secondary consideration. There are just so many variables to keep track of!

**Determining bipolar disorder diagnosis**

I’m trying to figure out the right diagnosis since he isn't currently manic. There's a history of manic episodes, so I'm considering “Bipolar I disorder, most recent episode manic, in full remission.” But I need to choose the right ICD-10 code: F31.9 or F31.0? Given the past year’s manic episode lasting a couple of weeks, he could fit into ""Bipolar I disorder, most recent episode manic, in partial remission."" Without clearer details, I might lean toward F31.9, especially if his mood isn't clearly severe right now. It's all so nuanced!

**Evaluating bipolar and psychotic disorders**

I'm contemplating a diagnosis of ""Other specified bipolar and related disorder"" (F31.89) or ""Unspecified bipolar and related disorder"" (F31.9), but I also need to look into substance-induced psychotic disorder, which has no substance history here. Then, I wonder if ""Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.2) could apply, but he's just hypertensive. Since he's 25 and showing negative symptoms with disorganization, a potential primary diagnosis might be schizophrenia (F20.9), maybe with schizoaffective disorder as a differential. It’s quite a puzzle!

**Identifying top diagnoses and codes**

I'm sifting through possible diagnoses and thinking about ""Bipolar I disorder, unspecified"" (F31.9) and ""Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder"" (F19.959). I need to consider distinct F-codes while keeping them plausible. The list could include: 1. Schizophrenia (F20.9), 2. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type (F25.0), 3. Bipolar I disorder (F31.9), 4. Substance-induced psychotic disorder (F19.959), and 5. Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder (F29). I want to ensure I keep this structured and clear!

**Determining substance use codes and diagnoses**

I need to consider substance use codes, noting that F1x.1 is for abuse and F1x.2 for dependence. For substance-induced psychotic disorder, F1x.5 applies. If I'm focusing on general F-codes, I can go with F19.959, which covers unspecified psychotic disorder due to psychoactive substance. However, without evidence of substance use, I should lean toward other plausible diagnoses. I think I can list: 1. Schizophrenia (F20.9), 2. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type (F25.0), 3. Bipolar I disorder (F31.9), 4. Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder (F29), and 5. Schizophreniform disorder.

**Clarifying psychosis diagnoses**

Substance-induced psychosis could be a consideration, but without specific clues about substance use, its likelihood diminishes. I want to focus on typical differentials for psychosis, which include schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder with psychotic features, and psychotic disorders linked to medical conditions. Given the instructions to list five likely diagnoses, I plan my top five:

1. Schizophrenia - F20.9
2. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type - F25.0
3. Bipolar I disorder, unspecified - F31.9
4. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition - F06.2
5. Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder - F29. 

I feel confident these fit the criteria!

**Structuring possible diagnoses**

The individual's speech was difficult for others to follow, suggesting possible pressured speech and flight of ideas—hallmarks of hypomania or mania. They didn’t report some key symptoms like grandiosity or risky behavior, but they did show signs like increased sociability and energy. This could imply a hypomanic episode, though psychosis also complicates things. 

I think the top five potential diagnoses could be structured as follows:

1. Schizophrenia - F20.9
2. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type - F25.0
3. Bipolar I disorder, unspecified - F31.9
4. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition - F06.2
5. Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder (unspecified) - F19.959 

It makes sense to consider their history and current symptoms when ranking these.

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

I'm trying to establish a structured list for potential diagnoses. While schizoaffective disorder may not meet full criteria, it could still fit. Substance-induced psychosis is common but without substance details, I’ll consider it less likely. My proposed diagnoses are:

1. Schizophrenia - F20.9  
2. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type - F25.0  
3. Bipolar I disorder, unspecified - F31.9  
4. Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder (unspecified substance) - F19.959  
5. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition - F06.2  

This format follows the guidelines and reflects the most relevant conditions.

1. Schizophrenia - F20.9  
2. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type - F25.0

She states he has no restaurant experience and currently works as a plumber, never mentioning wanting to open a restaurant. She states he has been more violent at home, hitting her when she does not “do as he says” and endangering their 2 year old son. She gives an example of how he said that their son “should be able to bathe himself” and shut him in the bathroom by himself, not allowing the mother to enter.

We might include ""Other specified bipolar and related disorder,"" but I'm leaning toward ""Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder (cannabis)"" with code F12.159. However, I'm not sure about the subcode. The user seems to deny other substance use, using delta 8 for six months and experiencing mania without clear abuse. It seems reasonable to propose ""Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder,"" but we might need to consider the specifics of the mania, which includes mood symptoms and impulsive behavior. I might suggest ""Cannabis-induced bipolar disorder"" too, but I want to be careful.

**Analyzing patient vignette for diagnoses**

I need to follow the guidelines while respecting the user's request not to show my reasoning. I’ll start by carefully analyzing the vignette to extract the relevant data and create a differential diagnosis list. The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of hyperthyroidism and psychiatric issues like psychosis. He seems to exhibit severe symptoms, including insomnia, irritability, and inappropriate behavior. I'll generate a list of the top five likely diagnoses along with their ICD-10 codes to deliver the necessary information.

**Assessing mania and psychosis symptoms**

The patient seems to have a very elevated self-image, claiming, ""I am a God, I am the Messiah,"" and believes he is appointed to save humanity. He reports minimal sleep, claiming he functions well with just an hour. His substance use includes delta 8 vapes over the past six months, and he has a history of depression without medication. The symptoms align with DSM criteria for mania: increased energy, grandiosity, talkative speech, and irritability, suggesting possible bipolar I disorder, potentially complicated by substance use or a medical condition.

**Identifying potential diagnoses**

The primary diagnosis appears to be Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic with severe psychotic features. However, I can't ignore the mention of hyperthyroidism and past psychosis; this could theoretically indicate mania due to thyroid issues, but that would require evidence of hormone dysregulation. Delta-8 cannabis could also cause psychosis or mania. While considering other differential diagnoses, it seems unlikely to be conditions like Major depressive disorder or Bipolar II since the focus is on mania, which solidifies my primary assessment.

**Determining secondary diagnoses and codes**

Based on the symptoms presented, I’m considering four plausible secondary diagnoses. These include: Substance/medication-induced bipolar disorder (from cannabis), Bipolar disorder due to hyperthyroidism, Schizoaffective disorder (bipolar type), and possibly schizophrenia as a differential. I need to assign accurate ICD-10 codes: 

1. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic with psychotic features: F31.2. 
2. For cannabis-induced disorder: I think F12.94 seems appropriate. 
3. Bipolar disorder due to another medical condition: F06.33. 
4. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type: F25.0. 
5. Schizophreniform disorder might fit if symptoms are between 1-6 months, so I’ll consider both that and Unspecified psychotic disorder (F29) for the fifth. 

Overall, I’m leaning toward those codes, ensuring they reflect the patient's condition accurately.

**Organizing diagnoses for structure**

I need to confirm the diagnosis name should properly reflect ""Cannabis-induced bipolar and related disorder"" or ""Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder (cannabis)"" with the code F12.94. Even though it's not widely recognized, I think it's fitting. I also need to ensure that the top five diagnoses include substantial psychiatric relevance and not just secondaries.

My proposed list is as follows:
1. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, with psychotic features - F31.2.
2. Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar and Related Disorder (cannabis/delta-8) - F12.94.
3. Bipolar disorder due to a medical condition (hyperthyroidism) - F06.33.
4. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type - F25.0.
5. Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder - F29. 

I feel this structure captures the essence of the diagnostic needs while following the guidelines given.

1. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, with psychotic features - F31.2  
2. Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder (cannabis/delta-8) - F12.94  
3. Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition (hyperthyroidism), with manic features - F06.33  
4. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type - F25.0  
5. Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder - F29

1052,"A 15-year-old Hispanic female with a history of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), stable on a low dose selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) for over a year, presented to the outpatient clinic with new-onset symptoms over the past 3–4 weeks including insomnia, panic attacks, and difficulty concentrating. The patient described a significant emotional event occurring two months ago: the death of her pet cat. She reported persistent crying spells, intrusive flashbacks of her cat’s death and burial, loss of appetite, and trouble falling asleep. She denied anhedonia, active or passive suicidal ideation, and maintained that she still enjoys going to school and spending time with friends and her younger sister. Despite these supports, she has noticed a decline in academic performance due to frequent, intrusive thoughts about her pet, particularly during class. She also reported an incident two weeks ago, when she became short of breath, diaphoretic and had experienced palpitations and had to excuse herself to “get some fresh air” in the middle of her music class. Washing face with cold water helped. Reported worrying about similar thing might happen again. During the evaluation, the patient presented with a constricted affect and became tearful while recalling memories of her cat but appeared more cheerful when discussing positive aspects of her life. She reported ongoing support from her mother, stepfather, and friends.

Criteria A: time line -developed within 3 months of the stressor; Criteria B: Impairment in functioning; Criteria C: Doesn’t seem like merely an exacerbation of her previous GAD and the depression, panic attacks, and intrusive thoughts are new.","**Considering diagnostic options**

I'm looking at what they asked for in the clinical case vignette. They want a structured list of psychiatric diagnoses, specifically the top 5 with corresponding ICD-10 F-codes. I understand that I'm to include likely conditions, even if they don't fully meet criteria. Panic disorder seems plausible as a secondary diagnosis, but I need to be cautious about possible mania or hypomania from SSRI usage since there are symptoms like insomnia and crying spells, but no elevated mood.

**Evaluating anxiety diagnoses**

I’m considering whether “SSRI-induced activation” could be causing her insomnia and panic, but she’s been stable on a low dose for a year, and the onset followed her pet’s death, making it less likely. I’m weighing “Adjustment disorder with anxiety” against mixed anxiety and depressive symptoms since she has persistent crying spells and a loss of appetite. I think the top diagnoses should be: 1. Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood - F43.23; 2. Generalized anxiety disorder - F41.1; 3. Other specified anxiety disorder (panic attacks), as it might represent her symptoms better.

**Analyzing symptom onset**

The vignette mentions ""new-onset symptoms over the past 3–4 weeks,"" which includes insomnia and panic attacks. It could suggest there were multiple attacks, even if only one is described. If she has had at least one panic attack and worries about recurrence, she might meet the criteria for panic disorder, especially if those worries have lasted around two weeks. I’m considering panic disorder as a secondary diagnosis, along with “Major depressive disorder, single episode, mild” or “Unspecified depressive disorder,” but her symptoms might not fully match.

**Formulating top diagnoses**

I'm considering ""Posttraumatic Stress Disorder"" (PTSD) but realize the criteria might not be met; still, some may misdiagnose it. Since we’re creating a top 5 list, I might include PTSD as a differential, but it feels less likely. For the top diagnoses: Primary should be Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood (F43.23), followed by Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1), Panic Disorder (F41.0), Other Specified Depressive Disorder, and possibly an Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder (subthreshold PTSD-like). I'm weighing if that’s more suitable than a depressive disorder given her symptoms.

**Finalizing diagnostic list**

I’m evaluating the possibility of including PTSD, but the criteria might not be met since the loss was a pet. ""Separation Anxiety Disorder"" isn’t applicable since she's not anxious about losing others. I’m realizing I need to finalize my list of diagnoses. The primary diagnosis should be Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood (F43.23). Then I’ll follow with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1), Panic Disorder (F41.0), Other Specified Depressive Disorder (F32.89), and Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder (F43.8).

**Finalizing diagnostic codes**

I’m considering whether to include panic disorder since it may meet the criteria, especially given the context of intrusive grief and stress causing panic attacks. I need to ensure accurate coding for the diagnoses: Panic Disorder (F41.0), Other Specified Depressive Disorder (F32.89), and Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder (F43.8). Both Adjustment Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder might apply, but I'll include GAD given its history. 

Here’s the final list:
1. Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood - F43.23  
2. Generalized anxiety disorder - F41.1  
3. Panic disorder - F41.0  
4. Other specified depressive disorder - F32.89

1053,"A 20-year-old African American male with no prior psychiatric history presented to the emergency department with a one-week history of abnormal behavior, depressed mood, and headaches. He had been functioning well and working full-time until the onset of symptoms. One month prior, he had tested positive for COVID-19. Initial symptoms included anxiety, insomnia, depressed mood, and headache, which rapidly progressed to auditory hallucinations, paranoia, and functional impairment, raising concerns for an acute psychiatric or neurological process. On the third day of psychiatric hospitalization, the patient became selectively mute, immobile, and refused oral intake. He developed a low-grade fever and intermittent twitching of the right arm. Trials of haloperidol, benztropine, olanzapine, lorazepam, and hydroxyzine were ineffective. Due to the concern for seizures, he was transferred to an inpatient neurology unit. Workup included basic labs (within normal limits), unremarkable brain imaging, and an EEG showing moderate encephalopathy without epileptiform activity or clinical seizures. Autoimmune encephalitis was considered and investigated, but no definitive diagnosis was established. During neurology admission, there was no clinical improvement. Psychiatry was re-consulted, and the patient showed partial response to benzodiazepines. Gradual improvement was noted, with return of speech, mobility, and normalized vital signs. He was transferred to a long-term acute care facility, where he continued to improve. Within one month, he achieved full recovery and was discharged home.",Catatonia Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (Catatonia due to known physiological condition F06.1),,pooja_chaudhary,,,"Catatonia Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition: here, encephalitis post COVID infection","**Evaluating F-code possibilities**

I'm systematically listing differential diagnoses using F-codes. For instance, I could consider catatonic disorder (F06.1) or brief psychotic disorder (F23). There's also psychotic disorder due to a medical condition (F06.2), and mood disorders (such as F06.31 or F06.32) which seem relevant. Then there's delirium (F05). It's crucial to stick to the top five likely diagnoses. I might include catatonia associated with another disorder but I'm unsure about the code for that. Hm, it’s quite complex!

**Considering diagnoses F20.81 and BPD**

I'm weighing the possibility of ""Schizophreniform disorder"" (F20.81), but its symptoms must last at least one month, and here it seems like they lasted maybe less than a month with full recovery within that time. He was hospitalized, showed gradual improvement, and fully recovered within around one month. If symptoms last exactly a month, it’s borderline. However, ""Brief psychotic disorder"" fits better since it requires symptoms for at least one day but less than a month, aligning with the recovery timeline. So BPD seems more accurate!

**Exploring diagnostic possibilities**

I'm considering whether ""Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder"" could apply, but it's not mentioned. What about ""Bipolar disorder"" with psychosis? Doesn't seem relevant. There’s the possibility of ""Catatonia associated with another mental disorder,"" but I can't code that directly. Maybe I should use ""Brief psychotic disorder with catatonia"" (F23) since capturing catatonia seems essential. The guidelines suggest I compile a structured list of the top five diagnoses based on the given information without fabricating anything, so I need to ensure they are plausible.

**Deciding on primary and secondary diagnoses**

I’m considering the primary diagnosis as ""Catatonia due to another medical condition"" (F06.1) related to post-COVID encephalopathy, since catatonia is quite prominent here alongside fever and neurological symptoms. Even though we don't have a definitive medical cause, there's some EEG evidence to support this. 

For secondary diagnoses, I could list ""Brief psychotic disorder"" (F23) due to acute psychosis with recovery in under a month. Other options include ""Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.2) and ""Delirium"" (F05). Lastly, I might explore ""Other specified depressive disorder"" (F32.89) since the duration of symptoms is short.

**Determining psychiatric diagnoses**

I’m evaluating several options for diagnoses. It seems ""Unspecified catatonia"" (F06.1) could be the primary diagnosis due to the unclear underlying cause and the central role of catatonia. I also consider ""Brief psychotic disorder"" (F23), as symptoms could fit this well. Then there’s ""Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.2) and ""Delirium"" (F05). I might also explore ""Schizophreniform disorder"" (F20.81), even though its duration might not fully align. 

It's tricky to choose the top five diagnoses, but I think I can finalize them like this:

1. Unspecified catatonia - F06.1
2. Brief psychotic disorder - F23
3. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition - F06.2
4. Delirium due to another medical condition - F05
5. Schizophreniform disorder - F20.81

**Diagnosing catatonia and psychosis**

I'm weighing my options for diagnosis here, deciding if ""Unspecified catatonia"" (F06.1) should be primary or if I should list it as secondary. If it's primary, I'd need to support how it fits with the patient's symptoms and background. I find catatonia might relate to their medical history, especially with post-COVID encephalopathy in play.

Considering the timeline of symptoms, I think I can present the following top diagnoses:

1. Unspecified catatonia - F06.1 (possibly due to medical condition)
2. Brief psychotic disorder - F23
3. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition - F06.2
4. Mood disorder due to another medical condition with depressive features - F06.31
5. Delirium due to another medical condition - F05

This should help frame the assessment clearly!

**Deciding on diagnoses**

I'm considering the list of top diagnoses for this case. The primary candidate might be ""Brief psychotic disorder"" (F23) due to acute psychosis and a good recovery within a month, while we could categorize ""Unspecified catatonia"" (F06.1) as secondary.

It seems feasible to list:

1. Brief psychotic disorder - F23 
2. Unspecified catatonia - F06.1 
3. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition - F06.2 
4. Mood disorder due to another medical condition with depressive features - F06.31 
5. Delirium due to another medical condition - F05 

I’m leaning towards this structure to best capture the situation!

**Finalizing diagnosis options**

I'm deciding whether to choose ""Brief psychotic disorder"" (BPD) as the primary diagnosis while indicating ""psychotic disorder due to a medical condition"" as a potential differential. Based on the EEG findings of moderate encephalopathy, this suggests an underlying condition, but it's not definitive. 

So for the structured list, I’ll go with:

1. Brief psychotic disorder (F23) 
2. Unspecified catatonia (F06.1) 
3. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition (F06.2) 
4. Delirium due to another medical condition (F05) 
5. Schizophreniform disorder (F20.81) 

This maintains clarity while covering all essential bases!

**Deciding on primary diagnosis**

I'm considering whether to include ""Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder"" or ""schizophreniform disorder"" as options. I want to highlight the importance of correctly using ICD-10 codes for the diagnoses. After examining the presented symptoms—acute psychosis, minor catatonia, and the patient's recent COVID infection—it's clear that ""Brief psychotic disorder"" (F23) should be the primary diagnosis. 

I need to finalize the list without any reasoning, simply structured as:

1. Brief psychotic disorder - F23  
2. Unspecified catatonia - F06.1  
3. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition - F06.2  
4. Delirium due to another medical condition - F05  
5. Schizophreniform disorder - F20.81 

That seems comprehensive!

**Creating diagnosis list**

I'm exploring whether catatonia is related to anti-NMDA encephalitis in this patient who shows twitching, fever, and encephalopathy. I've considered various possible diagnoses and ICD-10 codes based on the information given. Since recovery occurred quickly without immunotherapy, anti-NMDA encephalitis may not be the case.

For the structured list of primary and secondary diagnoses, I'm deciding on these:

1. Brief psychotic disorder, with catatonia - F23  
2. Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition - F06.1  
3. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition - F06.2  
4. Delirium due to another medical condition - F05  
5. Schizophreniform disorder - F20.81  

That should be comprehensive!

**Finalizing diagnosis order**

I need to ensure I list the top five most likely diagnoses in the correct order. It seems the primary diagnosis should be Brief Psychotic Disorder with catatonia due to the patient's symptoms and recovery. Then I will include Catatonic Disorder due to another medical condition, followed by Psychotic Disorder due to another medical condition, Delirium due to another medical condition, and finally Schizophreniform disorder.

Here’s the structured list:

1. Brief psychotic disorder, with catatonia - ICD-10 F23  
2. Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition - ICD-10 F06.1  
3. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition - ICD-10 F06.2

1054,"A 16-year-old Asian male with no prior psychiatric history presented to an outpatient clinic following concerns raised by his school nurse about dizziness, low blood pressure, and significant weight loss. The patient reported feeling overwhelmed with school and experiencing depressed mood over the past 6-8 months. School staff filed a CPS report due to concern for neglect, prompting an investigation that revealed poor nutritional status and recommended mental health and nutritional support. The patient had a low BMI and reported dizziness on standing, suggesting possible orthostatic hypotension secondary to malnutrition. On psychiatric evaluation, the patient appeared dysphoric with downcast eyes and exhibited significant thought blocking, though he was able to follow commands during the physical exam. He maintained a constricted affect and avoided eye contact. The patient disclosed feelings of being overwhelmed by academic pressure but provided limited verbal communication overall. He nodded yes when asked if he had recurrent death thoughts. Nodded yes when asked if he had a plan but didn’t disclose the plan. His family was unaware of the severity of his condition, though they acknowledged his recent withdrawal, tiredness, lack of appetite and weight loss. A history of school bullying was reported, though developmental history was otherwise unremarkable. Decision was made to voluntarily admit the patient. By the second day of inpatient psychiatric admission, the patient's condition deteriorated further. He stopped speaking entirely, refused to move, refused food, did not follow directions, and presented with staring and unusual mannerisms.","Major Depressive Disorder single episode, severe, with catatonia (F32.2)",,pooja_chaudhary,,,"MDD single episode, severe, with catatonia is important to discuss here because the condition would require treatment of catatonia first as it may be life threatening. Catatonia symptoms: stupor, mannerism, and negativism. It's important to treat catatonia and hence the diagnosis of catatonia should be made along with depression.","**Clarifying diagnostic considerations**

I need to identify four secondary diagnoses rather than just differential diagnoses; this includes possible comorbidities and rule-outs. They’re looking for the top five most likely diagnoses, and I think the primary one might be a severe major depressive episode with catatonia, possibly featuring psychotic traits. I need to consider thought blocking, as it's typically linked to schizophrenia or catatonia. There are signs like constricted affect and suicidal ideation that point toward severe depression or possible psychosis. Deterioration to catatonia can suggest an underlying mood disorder or psychotic condition.

**Exploring diagnostic possibilities**

I need to consider ""Bipolar disorder, current episode depressed, severe, with catatonic features,"" but there's no history of mania or hypomania, which makes it less likely. ""Schizophrenia with catatonia"" could be another possibility, but there's not enough evidence for schizophrenia. The timeline shows depressed mood lasting 6-8 months, and for major depressive disorder (MDD), at least 5 symptoms are necessary. Symptoms like depressed mood, weight loss, fatigue, and possible diminished concentration indicate MDD. Although anhedonia isn't explicitly stated, dysphoria and withdrawal support it as a likely diagnosis.

**Finalizing diagnostic options**

I might also consider ""Other specified depressive disorder"" if there aren’t enough symptoms, but it looks like he likely meets the criteria for ""Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe."" The weight loss isn't due to anorexia, as there aren't body image issues. Now, looking at catatonia, there are DSM-5 criteria where he exhibits mutism, stupor, and unusual mannerisms, so he qualifies. Additionally, since he has suicidal ideation with a plan, I could think about including ""suicidal behavior disorder,"" but I need to focus on providing appropriate F-codes.

**Finalizing possible diagnoses**

I've noted several potential diagnoses to consider: 

1. Catatonia associated with another mental disorder - F06.1  
2. Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder - F29, to rule out emerging schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorders.  
3. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder - F50.82, as a possible contributor to malnutrition.  
4. Social anxiety disorder - F40.10, to rule out anxiety due to bullying.  

However, ""adjustment disorder with depressed mood"" seems more plausible, though its duration exceeds typical timeframes. I might also consider ""generalized anxiety disorder"" - F41.1, but that doesn’t fit perfectly either. Lastly, I could look at ""unspecified feeding or eating disorder"" – F50.9 since ARFID-specific features aren’t present.

**Crafting the top diagnoses**

As I consider how to diagnose, I'll likely focus on:

1. Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe, with catatonic features.
2. Catatonia associated with another mental disorder.
3. Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder, to rule out emerging schizophrenia.
4. Unspecified feeding or eating disorder, given the concerns around malnutrition.
5. Unspecified anxiety disorder or possibly adjustment disorder due to the stress of academic pressure and bullying, but I have to evaluate the criteria.

I need to ensure I'm listing only the most likely diagnoses with their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes, focusing on those that fit best.

**Identifying potential diagnoses**

I'm considering several diagnoses for this case. It's likely to include:

1. Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe, with catatonic features.
2. Catatonia associated with another mental disorder.
3. Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder, as there may be emerging symptoms.
4. Unspecified feeding or eating disorder due to significant weight loss.
5. Possibly adjustment disorder or unspecified anxiety disorder related to the patient's experiences.

I'm careful to focus on the strongest possibilities while ensuring they fit within the DSM-5-TR framework. I want to avoid assumptions yet aim for the most plausible options.

**Finalizing possible diagnoses**

I'm evaluating the potential diagnoses. I think it makes sense to include:

1. Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe, with catatonic features - F32.2
2. Catatonia associated with another mental disorder - F06.1
3. Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder - F29
4. Unspecified feeding or eating disorder - F50.9
5. Unspecified anxiety disorder - F41.9 or adjustment disorder - F43.23.

But the evidence for adjustment disorder seems wobbly since MDD is the primary diagnosis. So, I might favor unspecified anxiety as a differential but keep the list focused on what's most supported. It's tough, but I'll stick to those that fit best based on the provided information!

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

I need to present the top five psychiatric diagnoses. After considering the details, my final choices are:

1. Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe, with catatonic features - F32.2
2. Catatonia associated with another mental disorder - F06.1
3. Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder - F29
4. Unspecified feeding or eating disorder - F50.9

1055,"A 29-year-old female, 10-days postpartum, presented with her husband for new-onset command auditory hallucinations, decreased sleep, poor hygiene and paranoia.

The patient seemed very distant to her baby but denied any thoughts of harming the baby. This is the first time that patient experienced such symptoms, and she was admitted to the psychiatric unit for evaluation and management. Initial mental status exam on admission revealed flight of ideas, inappropriate laughter, paranoid delusions, distractibility, poor hygiene and hyper talkativeness. Laboratory tests were clinically unremarkable. Olanzapine was started and titrated appropriately. Melatonin and temazepam nightly were started to regulate her circadian rhythm. Due to lack of effect, olanzapine was changed to risperidone. After 1-week of admission, significant improvement in her symptoms were noticed. Her sleep condition stabilized initially, and she demonstrated a partial return to baseline functioning, with improved mood and cognition. The patient was discharged on day 10. However, after a week of her discharge, the patient experienced a relapse of some of her symptoms. She became increasingly agitated, paranoid, and starting responding to internal stimuli. The family later reported that they stopped giving the medication upon discharge as the patient seemed back to baseline and with a worry that the medications may be excreted in breast milk. Restarting psychotropics resulted in marked improvement, and the patient’s condition stabilized once again.",Post-partum psychosis (F53.1),,pooja_chaudhary,,,This looks like post-partum psychosis mainly due to underlying bipolar disorder.,"**Evaluating diagnoses and ICD-10 codes**

I need to identify the top five diagnoses using ICD-10 F-codes. The primary likely diagnosis is Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features, with peripartum onset. This can apply when the onset occurs during pregnancy or within four weeks post-delivery, which fits since she’s 10 days postpartum. The ICD-10 for this would be F31.2. I also consider secondary differentials, like postpartum psychosis, but we already have bipolar as a primary diagnosis. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, is another option.

**Reviewing secondary diagnoses and ICD-10 codes**

I’m considering the established Bipolar I diagnosis, particularly the new onset of psychotic symptoms associated with mania and the postpartum trigger. While I think about brief psychotic disorder with postpartum onset, she has mood symptoms, making that less likely. Medication nonadherence could explain a relapse, but it's not a separate diagnosis. Insomnia and delusional disorders seem unlikely too. I still need four secondary diagnoses with F-codes. Possible codes include Bipolar I disorder (primary), and I might list Brief psychotic disorder with postpartum onset (F23) as a differential.

**Exploring possible diagnoses**

I'm considering a few more options for diagnoses. Major depressive disorder with peripartum onset isn't fitting since she has mania, not depression. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type (F25.0) could be relevant. I'm also thinking about substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder, but with unremarkable lab results and no mention of substances, it seems less likely. 

However, I might include it as a lower-likelihood differential diagnosis. For our top five, I’ll stick with Bipolar I disorder (F31.2) as the primary, and possibly Brief psychotic disorder with postpartum onset (F23) as a secondary option.

**Identifying possible differential diagnoses**

So I'm considering possible diagnoses: starting with Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type (F25.0) and Delusional disorder, persecutory type (F22), though that's less likely. Insomnia disorder as F51.01 could apply, particularly if due to mental disorder; however, decreased sleep is already indicative of mania. I’m thinking about adjustment disorder (F43.23), but that may not fit well either. 

Given her postpartum onset psychosis, I should include Major depressive disorder with peripartum onset (F32.3 or F33.3) as another option. I need to refine this list further to four plausible differential diagnoses.

**Clarifying potential diagnoses**

I’m wrestling with the idea of postpartum psychosis, which can show mood lability and psychosis, but it includes mania, too. As for differentials, postpartum depression with psychosis could bring bizarre delusions, but she doesn’t show depressed mood, making that less likely. 

I’m pondering other conditions like psychotic disorder due to another medical condition (F06.2) but the labs are unremarkable, so that's a stretch. My primary diagnosis would still be Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic with psychotic features (F31.2), followed by possible options like Brief psychotic disorder (F23), Schizoaffective disorder (F25.0), Major depressive disorder (F32.3), and Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition (F06.2).

**Summarizing probable diagnoses**

I’m putting together a structured list of the top five psychiatric diagnoses. The primary diagnosis is ""Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features, with peripartum onset (F31.2)."" For the secondaries, I'll include ""Brief psychotic disorder, with postpartum onset (F23),"" ""Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe with psychotic features, with peripartum onset (F32.3),"" ""Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type (F25.0),"" and ""Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder (F29).""

The user's request is to diagnose a clinical case vignette and provide a structured list of psychiatric diagnoses based on the DSM-5-TR, focusing on the primary diagnosis and four secondary ones. It feels a bit ambiguous to me—should I be giving the most likely diagnoses or building a differential diagnosis? They mention comorbidities, but also suggest a differential may be required. Since some details are missing, especially regarding DMDD, I need to tread carefully regarding its possible onset.

**Evaluating behavioral issues**

It seems like the case involves a child who may have repeated 4th grade due to past difficulties, possibly linked to ODD, as they show defiant behavior and irritability for at least six months. There’s a history of angry outbursts and fights, which could suggest issues like conduct disorder or intermittent explosive disorder. Notably, there's a pattern of blaming others and social isolation. The child's avoidance of eye contact and brief responses could indicate potential anxiety, depression, or even ASD. I need to consider these elements carefully.

**Assessing emotional and behavioral factors**

The user seems to be analyzing a child's emotional state, particularly around an appointment where the child could be upset. It's notable that he shows empathy by caring for pets, which might rule out callousness typically seen in conduct disorder. There’s no sign of psychosis or trauma, and he reached developmental milestones appropriately. His academic struggles, like repeating 4th grade, could point to a learning disorder or ADHD. I think ODD or DMDD are the most likely primary diagnoses, but I still need more information on symptom frequency and duration to determine which fits better.

**Exploring diagnostic options**

Looking at the child's symptoms, we see signs of an angry/irritable mood, temper outbursts, and arguments with authority figures. There are indications of aggression rather than simple defiance, which might point to ODD. However, the severity of the assaults and fights suggests something beyond ODD, possibly conduct disorder, but he doesn't meet those criteria. ""Other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder"" might be more fitting. Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) could also apply, but the ongoing irritability leans more toward DMDD. Additionally, his social isolation could suggest autism spectrum conditions, even though his milestones are appropriate.

**Evaluating potential diagnoses**

The user's case presents many complexities. Without evidence of restricted interests, it’s tricky to confirm autism spectrum disorder (ASD), though it remains a possibility. There are signs of irritability and withdrawal, which could lead to a diagnosis of unspecified depressive disorder. I also see the potential for major or persistent depressive disorder. Additionally, academic struggles suggest specific learning disorder or ADHD. ODD seems likely due to chronic irritability and aggression, but conduct disorder could fit too, given the physical fights. Ultimately, I’ll create a top five list, prioritizing diagnoses based on the details I’ve analyzed.

**Analyzing possible diagnoses**

In this case of a 15-year-old male, I see signs of chronic irritability and angry outbursts, which may lead to a diagnosis of Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD), but it requires specific frequency and duration that we lack. Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) seems likely due to the patient's behavior, along with features of potentially Intermittent Explosive Disorder. There’s also a possibility of Conduct Disorder, although the full criteria aren't met. Additionally, academic struggles suggest a Specific Learning Disorder. I’ll compile a top five list keeping ODD as primary for clarity.

**Clarifying top diagnoses**

The task involves providing a structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses, specifically five likely ones with corresponding ICD-10 F-codes. I could consider Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) as primary or Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) instead. DMDD suits the chronic irritability and angry outbursts, while ODD emphasizes defiant behaviors. I need to focus on key features, wondering which diagnosis best fits the patterns observed. Finally, my goal is to rank these in order of likelihood based on the patient's background and behaviors.

**Assessing potential diagnoses**

I'm evaluating the patient's background for diagnosing psychiatric conditions. Given his chronic irritability and angry outbursts, the primary diagnosis could be Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD). Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) might fit as a secondary diagnosis, but they can't coexist. Conduct Disorder and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) can also be considered, along with Specific Learning Disorder due to his academic struggles. It seems like I should present the five most plausible diagnoses and their corresponding ICD-10 codes based on the evidence from his behavior and history.

**Listing diagnoses and codes**

I’m finalizing the psychiatric diagnoses based on the provided information. For the primary diagnosis, I'm settling on Oppositional Defiant Disorder (F91.3) due to the defiance and irritability displayed. Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (F34.81) will be secondary since it might not fully meet guidelines. The other key diagnoses include Conduct Disorder (F91.2), Autism Spectrum Disorder (F84.0), and Specific Learning Disorder (F81.9). I’ll present them in a structured format without additional explanations.","1. Oppositional defiant disorder - F91.3  
2. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder - F34.81

1057,"A 77-year-old Caucasian female with a longstanding history of depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), chronic musculoskeletal pain and cannabis use disorder, presented to the outpatient clinic with visible facial scarring due to persistent skin picking. The patient was calm, cooperative and logical in thought process. She reported that the recent behavior began a 6 weeks ago, a few weeks after the death of her two pet cats and also worsened in the context of ongoing other family-related psychosocial stressors such as death of her only sibling (brother) who was residing at a nursing home. The patient described a similar episode approximately 45 years ago following the “institutionalization of my brother”, when she witnessed the “shocking” treatment of her brother after his first psychotic episode. She reported that she picks her skin and doesn’t like the feel of scabs afterwards. She reported an intense desire to picks on her scabs which often bleed and she reported a sense of gratification immediately but feeling guilt and shame a few minutes later. She had to visit a dermatologist because of recent wound infection due to picking of her lower lip skin. She shared that her lower lip was extremely tender at that time. She tried wearing gloves to stop her behavior but she continues to pick at scabs and healing skin, particularly on her face. She is currently on the maximum dose of an SSRI and receives care for chronic back pain. The patient is a retired hypnotherapist and forensic psychologist, and tried self-hypnosis with no improvement. She also acknowledged that consuming news media worsens her anxiety and shared that she uses marijuana, which she believes helps her cope.",Excoriation (Skin-Picking) Disorder under Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders (F42.4),,pooja_chaudhary,,,"Most common differential is OCD. Other differentials are substance use, worsening of mental health conditions and psychosis. The behavior emerged due to recent stress. The patient reported marked distress and have repeatedly tried to stop the behavior. Although she uses marijuana, substance use is chronic and there is no evidence that substance use is directly causing the picking. Dermatological causes were also evaluated and ruled out. Insight is preserved and the patient is not delusional or psychotic.","**Clarifying ICD-10 codes**

I need to be careful because ICD-10 codes can vary. For obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), I see it’s F42, but there are subcodes like F42.2 for mixed obsessional thoughts. The DSM-5 uses F42, but maybe F42.9 is a good option since it's unspecified. The user asked for ""ICD-10 F-codes,"" which might include decimals, so I should specify codes like F33.9 for major depressive disorder and F41.9 for unspecified anxiety.

**Analyzing diagnosis options**

For cannabis use disorder, I see F12.20 for uncomplicated cannabis dependence or F12.10 for abuse, considering the vignette uses ""cannabis use disorder."" I could lean toward F12.20. Alternatively, there’s F42.8 for ""Other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder,"" but for skin picking specifically, I have F42.4. Another possibility is F43.23 for ""Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood,"" considering her history of longstanding depression. However, I should confirm any recent symptoms related to stress before making a final decision.

**Evaluating potential disorders**

The stressors are significant, but there's no mention of impairment beyond skin picking. I need to provide the top 5 likely diagnoses, so I’ll include adjustment disorder as a differential, even though we already have four comorbidities. She has chronic musculoskeletal pain, but that doesn't have a clear F code. At 77 years old, we could consider ""Illness anxiety disorder,"" but that may not fit. She does use marijuana. 

I should explore ""Obsessive-compulsive disorder"" versus ""Excoriation disorder,"" considering her long-standing OCD. Another option could be ""Body dysmorphic disorder,"" but the picking seems more related to sensation than appearance.

**Finalizing diagnosis codes**

I have multiple diagnoses laid out: 1. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (F42.9), 2. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, unspecified (F33.9), 3. Unspecified anxiety disorder (F41.9), and 4. Cannabis use disorder, unspecified or moderate/severe (F12.20).

I need to ensure I'm using only F codes. F12.20 refers to uncomplicated cannabis dependence, but the DSM-5-TR separates severity levels. Since I don't know the severity, F12.20 might be appropriate, but using F12.10 as mild could be more conservative. Ultimately, coding as ""Cannabis use disorder, unspecified"" could fit if we don’t specify severity, though it’s crucial to select an ICD-10 code.

**Determining diagnosis codes**

I’m looking at using ""Cannabis use disorder, unspecified"" but I need to be precise with the codes. F12.90 is for uncomplicated cannabis use, which isn’t a disorder. F12.20 indicates moderate/severe cannabis dependence according to DSM-5, while F12.10 is for mild. Given her history and use for coping, I could lean towards F12.20, though it might imply more severity than warranted. 

Ultimately, I’ll compile my list of diagnoses, including skin-picking disorder and major depressive disorder, along with unspecified anxiety issues and cannabis use disorder as added context.

**Identifying top diagnoses**

The user wants me to list the top five diagnoses with corresponding ICD-10 codes. For cannabis use disorder, I can go with F12.20 since it indicates moderate to severe and relates to her coping strategy. I’m also considering F12.10 for mild, but that assumes a severity I can't confirm.

For major depressive disorder, F33.9 fits as she has a longstanding history. For OCD, F42.9 works. I should include excoriation disorder labeled as F42.4. For anxiety, I might choose F41.9 or A41.1. My final list could then look like this.

**Listing psychiatric diagnoses**

The user instructed me to provide a structured list of the top five psychiatric diagnoses along with their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes without any additional reasoning. For cannabis use disorder, I’ll use F12.20. For depression, I’ll opt for F33.9, indicating recurrent major depressive disorder. I’ll select F42.4 for excoriation disorder, F42.9 for obsessive-compulsive disorder, and finally, F41.9 for unspecified anxiety disorder. 

So here’s the final structured list:

1. Excoriation (skin-picking) disorder - F42.4  
2. Obsessive-compulsive disorder - F42.9  
3. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, unspecified - F33.9  
4. Unspecified anxiety disorder - F41.9  
5. Cannabis use disorder - F12.20

**Crafting final response**

I’m considering that the diagnosis could be ""Other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder"" if the full excoriation criteria aren't met. However, it seems that they are met since there are lesions, distress, and attempts to stop. I should also avoid including ""chronic musculoskeletal pain"" since it doesn't have an F-code tied to it. 

Now, I’m ready to deliver the final answer without that mention. Let's go ahead and present the results!","1. Excoriation (skin-picking) disorder - F42.4

1058,"A 20-year-old male college student was brought in by campus security after exhibiting increasingly bizarre behavior, including social withdrawal, not eating or sleeping, and abrupt mood shifts. Family filed a police complaint after losing touch with him and his room-mate (knows the patient since elementary schools) is also present during the interview. Reported that the patient had been absent from classes for four weeks before suddenly returning, appearing disheveled and noticeably different from baseline. During the interview, the patient displayed slow, delayed speech that unexpectedly escalated in volume before he abruptly left mid-conversation without explanation. He had difficulty maintaining focus and gave vague or tangential responses. Making statements such as “god made me a rabbit and you are my master” and “I have killed multiple planets in my backyard”. Roommate reported that he had been isolating and making odd statements that ""sometimes doesn’t make sense."" But this is the worst he has seen him. For past two-three months or so, the patient stopped attending parties and classes. The patient has a history of chronic marijuana use since age 14, the roommate also reported that he tried “crack cocaine and mushrooms” last year during their Arizona trip but had a “bad trip” at that time and he has not witnessed any substance use since then. The patient is tested negative on a urine drug screen. Alcohol levels are normal. Creatinine kinase is significantly elevated but all other labs are normal. There is a significant family history of schizophrenia in father and mother had alcohol use disorder, who passed away from alcoholic cirrhosis.",Schizophreniform disorder with good prognostic features (F20.81),,pooja_chaudhary,,,"Timeline, first episode, clean drug screen, chronicity of symptoms, and level of functional decline.","**Considering diagnostic options**

I'm trying to identify the top five likely diagnoses based on a clinical picture of first episode psychosis with disorganized speech and bizarre delusions lasting 2-3 months. Schizophreniform disorder seems most plausible, and schizophrenia could be a secondary diagnosis if symptoms persist over six months. I also think about substance-induced psychotic disorder due to cannabis use, although we have to stick to the facts about chronic use. Brief psychotic disorder is unlikely since symptoms have lasted more than a month.

**Analyzing symptoms and potential diagnoses**

The vignette shows bizarre behavior increasing with social withdrawal, poor eating, and sleeping habits, along with abrupt mood shifts. The individual was absent from classes for four weeks and has isolated behavior over the past 2-3 months, which suggests possible psychotic symptoms. I think the odd statements might point to schizophreniform disorder. Schizoaffective disorder isn’t met due to the lack of a significant mood episode. Major depressive disorder with psychotic features doesn’t apply either since mania isn’t clear, but bipolar disorder could be a consideration.

**Exploring potential diagnoses**

I’m considering the possibility of a ""psychotic disorder due to another medical condition,"" but there’s no supporting evidence for that. I wonder if ""other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders"" could fit, but I'm leaning toward including ""cannabis-induced psychotic disorder,"" though a negative UDS complicates that. Top five diagnoses appear to be: 1) Schizophreniform disorder, 2) Schizophrenia, 3) Substance/Medication-Induced (cannabis), 4) Bipolar I disorder with manic psychotic features, and 5) Cannabis use disorder, possibly coding it as F12.10 for abuse.

**Assessing diagnostic criteria**

I’m unsure about the criteria since the vignette doesn’t specify significant impairments, aside from possible withdrawal from classes. It raises the question of whether to include ""Cannabis use disorder"" as a diagnosis since there’s a history of chronic use from age 14, making it likely. However, without two symptoms causing impairment, it’s tricky. I could consider ""cannabis use disorder, unspecified,"" or possibly ""unspecified schizophrenia spectrum,"" but that feels redundant. Brief psychotic disorder could also be an option to include.

**Clarifying diagnostic considerations**

I’m trying to parse all the information here regarding potential diagnoses. Given symptoms like bizarre behavior, social withdrawal, and mood shifts, I believe “schizophreniform disorder” is primary since it fits the timeframe. “Schizophrenia” can be a secondary option if symptoms extend longer. “Substance-induced psychotic disorder” might be included due to cannabis history, despite a negative UDS. “Bipolar I disorder with psychotic features” could relate to mood shifts, but “brief psychotic disorder” doesn’t fit due to symptom duration. I’m leaning towards this set of possibilities based on the evidence available.

**Determining potential diagnoses**

I’m analyzing the timeline of symptoms here. Active psychosis seems likely since symptoms have lasted about a month, making ""schizophreniform disorder"" plausible. ""Brief psychotic disorder"" would need symptoms to be under a month, so it doesn't fit. I also considered ""schizoaffective disorder"" and ""major depressive disorder with psychotic features,"" but those lack sufficient supporting evidence. Cannabis use could imply a ""cannabis use disorder,"" but without clear criteria, I’m hesitant to include that. The final diagnosis list will need careful consideration of all these factors, especially how they fit within DSM-5 guidelines.

**Clarifying diagnosis codes**

I need to ensure I get these diagnosis codes right. Catatonia isn't present, so that rules out some options. ""Brief psychotic disorder"" could work if symptoms started within a month, but they might exceed that. ""Schizophreniform disorder"" seems more fitting since symptoms have lasted four weeks and show signs of impairment. I’m also considering ""bipolar disorder with psychotic features,"" but I need to verify the codes. It seems F31.2 refers to bipolar disorder with psychotic features, while F31.13 is for severe episodes. It's crucial I stick to the correct F-codes and their specifications!

**Selecting diagnosis codes**

I’m deciding between F31.2 and F31.13 for diagnosing bipolar I disorder. F31.2 is commonly used for ""Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, with psychotic features,"" so that seems like a good choice. For cannabis use disorder, I’m contemplating F12.20 for moderate/severe or F12.10 for mild. Given the chronic use since age 14, I lean towards F12.20, but clarity on impairment is tricky. I’m also considering including other relevant diagnoses. Ultimately, I need to focus on five plausible ones.

**Choosing diagnoses**

I'm sorting through various diagnoses, focusing on ""Cannabis use disorder"" and what code fits best, weighing F12.20 for moderate/severe or F12.10 for mild. Since the patient has chronic use, I tend towards F12.20 despite uncertainties about severity. I also consider whether to include psychosis-related diagnoses. There’s a complex interplay of symptoms, and I think identifying five most likely diagnoses is key. Balancing what’s probable versus speculative, I’ll ensure to justify any choice I make!

**Prioritizing diagnoses**

I'm focusing on the top 5 diagnoses. First is Schizophreniform disorder, as it fits best, followed by Schizophrenia due to expected progression. Cannabis-Induced Psychotic Disorder comes next since there’s a relevant history. I think Bipolar I disorder is valid based on mood shifts and sleep issues. The final choice is tricky; I could go for Brief Psychotic Disorder or Schizoaffective Disorder, though the former might be more plausible. All in all, I aim for a structured and accurate list, ensuring the ICD-10 codes are correct!

**Finalizing the diagnoses**

I'm considering that catatonia or neuroleptic malignant syndrome might be relevant, but since he isn't on medication and shows no catatonic signs, it complicates things. I should focus on ""Catatonia associated with another mental disorder,"" but we can't confirm that diagnosis. In any case, my primary diagnosis has to reflect the best fit, which I believe is Schizophreniform disorder, given the symptoms have lasted for 2-3 months.

1059,"A 16-year-old Hispanic female, immigrated to the United States two years ago from a conflict-affected region in South America, presented to the child psychiatry clinic for follow up evaluation and with recent complaints of frequent and severe verbal outbursts at school. The patient had a documented history of chronic sexual abuse and has also witnessed violence, both in her country of origin and during migration. She was accompanied by her biological mother. The patient presented for an initial evaluation six months ago and was lost to follow up since then. At that time, a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was made by the same outpatient mental health provider. The patient reported significant improvement in frequency and intensity of nightmares since started on medications six months ago. Re-established care because the school staff reported frequent episodes (occurring one-two times per week) in which the patient would become suddenly angry, shouting profanities and making personally hurtful comments toward teachers, administrators, and peers. These episodes were often precipitated by perceived criticism, sudden changes in expectations, or ambiguous social cues. Despite these outbursts, the patient was described as highly intelligent, academically capable, and frequently helpful to classmates. She was logical and articulate in conversations when calm but maintained a guarded and cautious interpersonal style. During clinical interview, the patient was initially reserved but opened up during the later parts of the interview. She endorsed persistent feelings of anger, mistrust, and fear, particularly in unfamiliar or male authority-driven environments. She denied hallucinations, current suicidal ideation, or substance use. Sleep disturbances, including frequent nightmares and early-morning awakenings, were reported. Cognitive assessment suggested average to above-average intellectual functioning, and no evidence of developmental delays or psychotic symptoms was noted or reported. Prior to migration, the patient had limited access to formal education, which appeared to contribute to a heightened sensitivity to perceived failure or criticism in the current school environment.",Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) (F63.81),,pooja_chaudhary,,,Major differential is PTSD.,"**Analyzing psychiatric diagnoses**

I need to provide the top five DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses along with their ICD-10 F codes based on the vignette. The primary diagnosis seems likely to be PTSD, given the trauma history and symptoms like nightmares and hyperarousal. I’m considering differential diagnoses like PTSD with dissociative features, an adjustment disorder, or even Intermittent Explosive Disorder, though that may not fit perfectly. I should also look into Oppositional Defiant Disorder, but it does require more symptoms for a solid diagnosis.

**Evaluating possible diagnoses**

I’m considering ""Depressive disorders"" as a possibility, but it's not clearly described. Anxiety could also play a role, potentially generalized or social anxiety due to fear in authority-driven environments. There’s the question of ""Reactive attachment disorder"" or ""Disinhibited social engagement disorder,"" but she's 16, and those are usually diagnosed in younger individuals. ""Borderline personality disorder"" could emerge at this age, yet there isn't enough evidence. Intermittent Explosive Disorder might apply due to aggressive impulses, but that’s tricky since it can't be better explained by another disorder like PTSD.

**Exploring potential diagnoses**

I’m considering sleep disturbances like nightmares and early-morning awakenings, which can indeed be part of PTSD. However, if they cause persistent impairment, I could list ""Insomnia disorder"" as a secondary diagnosis. There's also the possibility of ""Adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct"" since she immigrated two years ago and experiences chronic stress. Other options include ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" or ""Unspecified anxiety disorder,"" though these connect back to PTSD too. I’m also thinking about ""Oppositional defiant disorder,"" given her verbal outbursts, but it needs careful consideration alongside any PTSD diagnosis.

**Considering likely diagnoses**

I’m thinking about possible diagnoses like ""Intermittent Explosive Disorder,"" ""Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder,"" ""Oppositional Defiant Disorder,"" ""Social Anxiety Disorder,"" and ""Major Depressive Disorder."" However, I need to narrow it down to the top five most likely options. Given the trauma and symptoms like irritability, anger outbursts, and hypervigilance, PTSD seems to fit best as the primary diagnosis. I’m also weighing secondary options like Oppositional Defiant Disorder, but it's a tricky call between those and others like Adjustment Disorder or unspecified anxiety disorders.

**Determining top diagnoses**

I’m focused on establishing the top five DSM-5 diagnoses, including their corresponding ICD-10 F codes. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (F43.10) seems primary, and I might include Intermittent Explosive Disorder (F63.81) and Oppositional Defiant Disorder (F91.3) as secondaries. I’m also considering Insomnia Disorder (F51.01) and Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9). The tricky part is balancing what fits best given her history and symptoms while ensuring these choices align with criteria, even if some factors might overlap.

**Selecting probable diagnoses**

I’m evaluating options for the top five diagnoses, focusing primarily on those that fit the criteria well based on the information provided. It’s clear that PTSD (F43.10) is the main diagnosis. I’m thinking about including Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder (F91.8) due to the frequent verbal outbursts. I could also lean towards Insomnia Disorder (F51.01) and Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9) for the secondary diagnoses. Lastly, I’m considering Adjustment Disorder (F43.25) as a possibility, but it may be tricky given the presence of PTSD.

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

I'm considering the most relevant diagnoses for this case. It's clear that PTSD is the primary diagnosis, so I’ll keep that at the top. For secondary diagnoses, I'm weighing options like Intermittent Explosive Disorder, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, and possibly Adjustment Disorder. Some options like Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder might not fit due to the age of onset. Ultimately, I’ll include the best five conditions with their corresponding codes, aiming for a structured list that meets the requirements given.

**Choosing top diagnoses**

I'm assessing the most likely conditions for this case. The first diagnosis is clearly PTSD, supported by trauma exposure and symptoms like nightmares. For secondary diagnoses, I'm leaning towards Intermittent Explosive Disorder for the verbal outbursts and Oppositional Defiant Disorder. While Adjustment Disorder might fit given the current stressors, it could be seen as redundant with PTSD. Ultimately, I’ll finalize the top five diagnoses, ensuring they align with DSM-5-TR criteria without overdiagnosing.

**Finalizing diagnoses**

I've been assessing possible diagnoses, focusing on the criteria. The primary diagnosis is clearly PTSD, given the trauma signs and symptoms. For secondary diagnoses, I’m considering ""Other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder"" due to the outbursts that don't fully fit other disorders. I also want to include ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" and ""Insomnia disorder"" to address specific symptoms. Lastly, I'm deciding between ""Adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct"" or ""Adjustment disorder with mixed emotions."" Ultimately, I want to ensure everything aligns correctly without overdiagnosing.

**Finalizing the diagnoses list**

It looks like I'm deciding on a structured list of psychiatric diagnoses. I'll include PTSD as the primary diagnosis, given the significant symptoms. For the four secondary diagnoses, I think I’ll go with Intermittent Explosive Disorder, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Unspecified Anxiety Disorder, and Insomnia Disorder. Each diagnosis will correspond with the appropriate ICD-10 F-code, making sure everything's aligned with the DSM-5-TR terminology. Okay, here's the final list:

1060,"An 18-year-old African American female was referred by her primary care provider (PCP) for evaluation of passive thoughts of death. The patient has been under her PCP’s care for persistent dizziness, failure to gain weight, persistent nausea and reported dysphagia. She presents with a complex psychosocial history. She lives with her single mother, following the death of her maternal grandmother, two years ago. Her maternal grandmother raised her since the age of 8 years old, shortly after her father died in a motor vehicle accident when she was eight years old, an event she witnessed, although she denies current post-traumatic stress symptoms. Despite significant personal hardship, she graduated early from high school and is currently working two jobs, though she expresses dissatisfaction with college and reports feeling disconnected from peers. Recently separated from her boyfriend of 1 year. Upon initial exam, the patient endorsed symptoms of low mood, irritability, and insomnia. She was tearful throughout the interview. Stated that she likes gardening and going out for walks. However, reported chronic poor appetite with nausea, fear of choking while eating, and has lost significant weight.

Gastrointestinal and ENT evaluations, including imaging, esophagoscopy, and laryngoscopy, were unremarkable. Despite reported dysphagia, there are no structural findings.

Socially, she has few supports and describes conflict with peers due to ongoing irritability.",Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) (F50.82),,pooja_chaudhary,,,,"**Evaluating adjustment disorder diagnosis**

I’m thinking about whether adjustment disorder applies here. The stressors are significant, and there are symptoms like low mood and irritability, but they don’t fully meet depression criteria. It seems that adjustment disorder could be appropriate alongside unspecified depression. In DSM-5, adjustment disorder is diagnosed with symptoms from identifiable stressors that don’t meet criteria for other disorders. If we list unspecified depressive disorder, we might exclude adjustment disorder, but I wonder about including both as alternatives in the top five diagnoses.

**Deciding on DSM-5-TR diagnoses**

I’m trying to figure out how to address the prompt for a structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses. It seems they want the top five most likely diagnoses, along with corresponding ICD-10 codes, which suggests a mix of differential diagnoses rather than strictly comorbid ones. Given the limited information, I think I might list plausible options, like ARFID and depressive disorder as likely comorbid conditions. Other possibilities could include specific phobia or somatic symptom disorder, but I’m aware of significant weight loss being present, which complicates things a bit.

**Evaluating possible diagnoses**

I’m considering various potential diagnoses, like “Depressive disorder due to another medical condition,” but it seems that might not fit here. Depression could stem from malnutrition, but I’ll pass on that too. I was thinking about “Other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder” for choking obsessions, but it may not apply. I wonder if “Generalized anxiety disorder” or “Social anxiety disorder” could work, especially given issues with disconnectedness and conflict. Another thought is “Functional neurological symptom disorder,” particularly with the swallowing symptoms. I’m thinking that dysphagia might actually be a conversion disorder.

**Clarifying diagnostic codes**

I’m re-evaluating the diagnostic codes for conversion disorder. F44.4 refers specifically to conversion disorder with motor symptoms, while F44.5 is for other related conditions. I'm considering whether swallowing difficulties might fit under ""conversion disorder with swallowing symptoms."" Yet, it seems more plausible to consider ""Somatic symptom disorder"" since there are multiple physical symptoms like weight loss and anemia. I’m also thinking about ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" or ""Unspecified anxiety disorder,"" especially since we already have specific phobia included. Generalized anxiety might apply due to various stressors.

**Revisiting the vignette**

Let’s carefully review the patient's case. She has passive thoughts of death and physical symptoms like dizziness, nausea, and dysphagia, along with a complicated personal history of loss. While she graduated early and is juggling two jobs, she feels disconnected from her peers. The depressive symptoms she exhibits might suggest a major depressive episode, but she doesn't meet all the criteria. 

Given her fear of choking and eating disturbances, I believe the primary diagnosis should be Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID). I also want to list Unspecified Depressive Disorder as a secondary diagnosis and consider other possible anxiety or stress-related disorders as well. Overall, I need to focus on gathering the most relevant top diagnoses.

**Outlining potential diagnoses**

I'm reviewing the patient's situation, which includes trauma exposure but a denial of PTSD symptoms. There are multiple factors to consider, like her fear of choking, which may fit into phobia or ARFID. While she faces various stressors, if her depressive symptoms are better captured by unspecified depressive disorder, adjustment disorder might not be necessary, yet could be included as an alternative. 

The evaluation points lead me to suggest a top five diagnoses: Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder, Unspecified Depressive Disorder, Specific Phobia (choking), Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, and Anorexia Nervosa (restricting type). Each must be prioritized based on her symptoms and psychosocial stressors.

1061,"A 62 years old Caucasian male (previously married with two adult children, and was working full time but, currently homeless) with history of hypertension, diabetes, asthma, systolic heart failure, and anxiety presented to emergency department (ED) with complaints of lower body weakness, psychosis and irritability with law enforcement officer after the patient was found lying down in the middle of a moderately busy road. The officer mentioned he was awake with eyes open, talking to self and screaming intermittently, but couldn’t get up when asked to move. Upon evaluation by the provider, the patient was making statements such as “they are watching us with AI gadgets” and brought themes of paranoia in the conversations.

I'm considering the DSM code F06.2, which applies to psychotic disorders with delusions linked to known physiological conditions. There's also the ""Delirium due to another medical condition"" option. Delirium can result from hypoglycemia, which disturbs attention and awareness. The subject displayed disorganized thoughts and irritability, suggesting potential delirium but was still talkative. I need to weigh these symptoms alongside their history of anxiety to determine the top five diagnoses, likely starting with delirium due to hypoglycemia.

**Analyzing symptoms and diagnoses**

I'm looking at a case with lower body weakness, psychosis, and irritability where the individual was found lying in the road. Their vitals pointed to bradycardia and hypoglycemia, which can lead to confusion and abnormal behavior. Severe hypoglycemia might mimic psychosis, but coherent paranoid delusions suggest a psychotic disorder. The presence of a positive VDRL test for syphilis raises the possibility of neuropsychiatric symptoms. It’s complicated by a history of homelessness, which may indicate chronic mental illness or late-onset psychosis.

**Identifying potential diagnoses**

I'm assessing information about diagnosing possible psychotic disorders. It's not enough to label it as schizophrenia without knowing the duration. I can consider ""Schizophreniform disorder"" or ""Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder"" (F29) as differentials. For the top five likely diagnoses, I would prioritize ""Delirium due to hypoglycemia"" (F05). Then ""Psychotic disorder due to neurosyphilis or hypoglycemia"" (F06.2), followed by F29. I’ll also think about ""Generalized anxiety disorder"" and possibly a ""Mild/major neurocognitive disorder"" as options.

**Exploring diagnosis options**

I’m reviewing the classification for major neurocognitive disorders, noting that the underlying condition is key for coding. F02.8 refers to dementia in other diseases. For neurosyphilis-related dementia, I think A52.3 applies, but I'm unsure about cognitive deficits here. ""Brief psychotic disorder"" (F23) could fit if symptoms had a sudden onset, although there isn’t enough evidence. However, I feel like focusing on ""Psychotic disorder due to another condition"" linked to syphilis and hypoglycemia or ""Delirium"" from hypoglycemia might be more correct given the labs and symptoms.

**Clarifying possible diagnoses**

I'm analyzing a situation where a patient showed paranoid thoughts, disorganized thinking, and irritability, alongside vital signs indicating bradycardia and hypoglycemia. The lab results suggest hypoglycemia may explain the immediate behavioral symptoms. However, the presence of a positive VDRL test raises concerns about neurosyphilis contributing to psychiatric symptoms. I’m weighing several diagnoses, including ""Delirium due to hypoglycemia"" and ""Psychotic disorder due to neurosyphilis."" It seems prudent to consider both possibilities and their ICD-10 codes while forming a primary diagnosis.

**Assessing possible conditions**

I’m considering various diagnoses based on the symptoms presented, including catatonia, psychosis, and delirium due to hypoglycemia. While the patient exhibits signs of irritability and psychosis, there’s no definitive indication of catatonia. The presence of a positive VDRL test raises concerns about neurosyphilis as a potential cause for psychotic symptoms. I'm leaning towards diagnosing ""Delirium due to hypoglycemia"" as primary and ""Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition"" as secondary, alongside other possibilities that may explain the behavioral changes.

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

I’m refining a list of possible diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms. I'll prioritize them by likelihood:

1. Delirium due to another medical condition (hypoglycemia) - F05  
2. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition (possible neurosyphilis) - F06.2  
3. Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder - F29  
4. Other (or unknown) substance-induced psychotic disorder - F19.959  
5. Unspecified anxiety disorder - F41.9  

This structured list captures the key options without additional reasoning since that's what the instructions clearly specify!

I’m updating the diagnosis list according to the correct format and F-codes. Here’s the final structured list:
