1001,"Leroy is a 34 year old male, whose chief complaint is, “I am having intrusive thoughts.” Leroy reports that “since childhood, I have been experiencing intrusive thoughts.” He reports he has met with a number of psychiatrists in the past, and has tried a range of different psychiatric medications. Leroy reports he was recently recommended by his present physician to see a psychiatrist again, given how distressing his intrusive thoughts have become. His previous psychiatrist started him on Zoloft, and gave him recommendation for community based mental health psychotherapist.  Leroy has been taking the Zoloft (200 mg daily) for about 5 years, for what he states his provider thought was “anxiety or depression.” Leroy acknowledges history of periods of “sadness”, stating “yeah sad, sometimes, but not depressed; when things get out of control; its been a while though; when something feels out of reach.” Denied present or past suicidal ideation, and denied problems with active thoughts, plans or intents of harm to self or others. Leroy insists no problems with perceptual distortion or paranoia, and denied thought insertion or thought broadcasting.  Leroy stated that the intrusive thoughts, “first started happening when I was a kid, I was able to cope with them; getting better understanding what they were; ways to get them to go away; calm myself down and regain control and go on with my life; now that is not working.” Leroy states the most recent intrusive thought has been a fear that the chart bus he drives from his local airport to downtown stop will “slide off the road because of ice or snow.” He thinks about this, on average, about 30 to 45 minutes a day.  Leroy endorsed episodes of “panic” and “my body almost feels like its paralyzed; I experience pain from my spine up”, which lasts for a couple of days at a time. With regards to “generalized anxiety”, patient reports “I would have these thoughts about my ailing mother; she has schizophrenia; my body would react to whatever I was thinking about her; my body tenses up when that happens.” Leroy denied any preoccupations about his physical health, nor inability to leave the home because of anxiety. He reports to work regularly, and rarely misses any work unless he is very sick. He says he is never late to work or planned appointments. Leroy has a girlfriend, and says that relationship is going “great.” In his spare time, he continues to join his friends for basketball pickup games and video game nights, which he still enjoys. Leroy does remember a feeling of having to tap the door handle a few times before he opens it, but said this never lasted more than a few second and was not associated with any fear of catastrophic consequences if he did not complete the task.  Leroy acknowledges observed violence/abuse of his parents when growing up, and with harsh parenting to his 3 siblings, patient denied problems with flashbacks, nightmares or hypervigilance associated with the trauma. Patient works second shift, gets home around 1:30 a.m., reports falling asleep at 2:30 a.m. and wakes up at 10/11 a.m., and can typically sleep through the night without interruption. He reports his energy level is “normal through the week.” Denied recent or past mania. Reports contributing stressors are “work --- not the most peaceful environment.” Also reports mother suffers from “type of schizophrenia and for a while she was taking medication and just recently now decided to stop; that’s been going on for quite some time.” Leroy’s urine toxicology returned with marijuana, and TSH level was within normal limits.",Obsessive compulsive disorder (F42.8),,judah_weathers,,,,"Let me carefully analyze this clinical case vignette to arrive at the most appropriate diagnoses.

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

1. **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1):**
The patient presents with worry that is difficult to control (intrusive thoughts about bus sliding off road, concerns about mother's health). He spends 30-45 minutes daily on these worry thoughts. Physical symptoms include muscle tension (""body tenses up""). This has been ongoing since childhood. However, the worry is somewhat specific (not generalized across multiple domains). The pattern of specific feared catastrophes is more consistent with OCD or specific phobia.

2. **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (F42.2):**
The patient has intrusive, unwanted thoughts (obsessions) about his bus sliding off the road due to ice/snow. He mentions having these thoughts 30-45 minutes daily (meets the criterion for significant time). History of door-handle tapping (possible compulsion), though brief and not associated with feared consequences. The intrusive thoughts are ego-dystonic and distressing. However, there's limited evidence of clear compulsions to neutralize the obsessions. This could be primarily obsess

ional OCD. The panic-like episodes he describes—where his body feels paralyzed with spine pain lasting a couple of days—don't align with typical panic attack presentations, which resolve within minutes. These seem more like sustained anxiety episodes. Regarding the positive marijuana screen, insufficient details exist about frequency, consequences, or dependence criteria to establish a substance use disorder diagnosis. An adjustment disorder with anxiety could apply if stressors are recent and the symptoms are temporally related to identifiable life changes.

However, his anxiety symptoms trace back to childhood, well before current stressors like his mother's illness or work pressures. PTSD doesn't fit despite his childhood exposure to violence and abuse, since he denies the core features of flashbacks, nightmares, and hypervigilance.

The most compelling diagnosis appears to be generalized anxiety disorder—he's experienced pervasive worry since childhood, maintains physical tension, struggles to control anxious thoughts, and the specific worry about the bus combined with concerns about his mother suggests a broader anxiety pattern rather than isolated fears. He functions adequately but remains significantly distressed. OCD remains a secondary consideration given the possible obsessional quality of his bus-related worry. The patient's language around ""intrusive thoughts"" and the specific content—worrying the bus will slide off the road—points toward obsessional thinking. The door tapping history suggests ritualistic behavior, though he didn't report feared consequences tied to it, which complicates whether true compulsions are present. Weighing the evidence, the anxiety appears multifaceted: obsessional features dominate, but there's also generalized worry about his mother and atypical panic episodes. Given this mixed presentation, Generalized Anxiety Disorder captures the broader pattern of persistent worry and chronic course more comprehensively than OCD alone.

However, the intrusive thoughts terminology and catastrophic content with childhood onset are compelling for OCD—the 30-45 minutes daily spent on these thoughts meets the time threshold. Panic episodes are documented, though their duration is unusual. Cannabis use is confirmed on toxicology but doesn't meet criteria for a use disorder based on available information. The remaining anxiety symptoms that don't fit neatly into the primary diagnoses might warrant an unspecified or other specified anxiety disorder code.

I should reconsider which diagnosis truly anchors this case. The patient's specific language and presentation suggest OCD warrants primary consideration. The intrusive thoughts about catastrophic accidents while driving represent a classic harm obsession, and the door-tapping behavior hints at compulsive patterns. He's already on maximum-dose Zoloft, the first-line treatment for OCD. The childhood onset and persistent nature further support this. While generalized worry about his mother with accompanying physical tension indicates GAD features, the intrusive thoughts remain the chief complaint and longest-standing concern.

OCD should be the primary diagnosis, followed by the other conditions in order of clinical significance. but not quite 1 hour. The 30-45 minute range still represents substantial time involvement with significant distress and functional consequences, which can support an OCD diagnosis even if slightly below the typical threshold.

I'm settling on OCD as a primary diagnosis alongside generalized anxiety, panic disorder, cannabis use, and other specified anxiety disorder. Though I should reconsider whether those panic episodes fit the typical presentation—the patient describes them lasting several days with physical symptoms, which seems atypical for standard panic attacks. Considering his childhood trauma history, an unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder could apply, though he hasn't endorsed typical PTSD symptoms. Ultimately, OCD appears to be the primary diagnosis given his presenting complaint, early-onset course, specific obsessional themes, and prior treatment responses. The differential should prioritize generalized anxiety disorder for his excessive worry and somatic tension, cannabis use based on positive screening, and possibly panic disorder despite the atypical presentation of his episodes. Other specified anxiety disorder might capture his limited symptom anxiety attacks more precisely than a standard panic diagnosis.","1. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder - F42.2

---

The manic episode from two years ago clearly fits the diagnostic criteria for mania—it lasted two weeks with prominent decreased need for sleep, grandiose beliefs, increased goal-directed activity, and risky sexual behavior that caused noticeable impairment. The key diagnostic question is whether this represents primary bipolar disorder or a secondary mood disturbance related to his MS or prior head trauma. The temporal relationship to an MS flare suggests a possible organic etiology, though MS-related mania is relatively uncommon. His significant head trauma with unknown imaging results also raises the possibility of neurological contribution to mood dysregulation.

His alcohol use clearly meets criteria for a moderate to severe disorder—consuming eight drinks daily, multiple failed attempts at abstinence, and substantial consequences including legal problems and relationship breakdown. He's now 76 days sober, indicating early remission. The recent losses of his fiancé, dog, and career represent significant psychosocial stressors that warrant consideration of an adjustment or trauma-related disorder, though he denies current mood symptoms beyond what might be expected from these circumstances.

The head trauma history with hospitalization and imaging is also relevant—neurocognitive impairment from traumatic brain injury could contribute to his presentation and should be ruled out. For coding purposes, Bipolar I Disorder in remission would be F31.74 if fully remitted or F31.73 if partially remitted. The alcohol use disorder codes as F10.21 in early remission. If the MS is deemed contributory to the manic episode, that would code separately as F06.33 or F06.34 depending on feature presentation.

The critical diagnostic consideration is determining whether his manic episode was a primary bipolar condition or secondary to the MS flare-up. The temporal relationship between the MS exacerbation and mood symptoms suggests the latter may be more accurate, though both diagnoses warrant consideration in the differential.

For the substance use component, alcohol dependence with severe features in early remission is clearly documented. The head trauma history and cumulative losses also point toward potential neurocognitive sequelae and adjustment difficulties that should be captured diagnostically. The primary question remains whether to code this as Bipolar I Disorder or as a secondary mood disorder attributable to the underlying neurological condition. d Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (MS), with manic features (F06.33) - as an alternative if the MS flare is deemed the primary etiology. However, listing both Bipolar I and this diagnosis for the same episode creates diagnostic redundancy, so I need to choose one primary approach.

The cleaner formulation would be: Bipolar I Disorder, most recent episode manic, in full remission (F31.74) as the primary diagnosis, followed by Alcohol Use Disorder, severe, in early remission (F10.21), then Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9) to account for the anxiety symptoms without over-specifying. I should also note the Mild Neurocognitive Disorder due to Traumatic Brain Injury (F06.70) given the documented head trauma history, and consider whether the trauma and losses warrant an additional stressor-related diagnosis. Alcohol Use Disorder, Severe, In Early Remission (F10.21) - Multiple criteria present including failed reduction attempts and significant consequences, with 76 days of sobriety marking early recovery. Bipolar and Related Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (MS), with manic features (F06.33) - The temporal relationship between the MS exacerbation and manic presentation warrants consideration as a potential medical etiology. Unspecified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder (F43.9) - Addresses the cumulative impact of recent losses including the relationship dissolution, pet death, and career disruption. Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Traumatic Brain Injury, without behavioral disturbance (F06.70) - The prior head trauma with hospitalization could contribute to cognitive changes. I'm recognizing that listing both Bipolar I and the medical condition-related bipolar disorder creates redundancy—they're competing explanations for the same manic episode, so I need to determine which better accounts for the clinical presentation. I, current or most recent episode, hypomanic, in full remission. F31.74 correctly captures Bipolar I disorder with the most recent manic episode now in full remission.

For the alcohol use disorder code, I need to verify the severity and remission status mapping. F10.20 denotes moderate severity without remission, while F10.21 indicates moderate severity in remission. The mild category uses F10.10 and F10.11 respectively.

The bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition with manic features (F06.33) and unspecified trauma-related disorder (F43.9) are both appropriate. For the neurocognitive disorder secondary to TBI, F06.70 applies when there's no behavioral disturbance, with F06.71 used if behavioral symptoms are present. I'm reconsidering whether mild neurocognitive disorder is the most accurate diagnosis given the clinical presentation.

The patient hasn't reported cognitive difficulties—we only know a head injury occurred. Without documented cognitive impairment, diagnosing a neurocognitive disorder may be premature. Similarly, while he's experienced significant losses, he denies depressed mood and doesn't describe emotional or behavioral symptoms that would meet adjustment disorder criteria. His mother's concerns don't necessarily align with his own reported experience. I need to focus on what's actually present in his presentation rather than what might be speculated.

The assault at the bar followed by behavioral changes—heavy drinking, withdrawing from activities like fishing—suggests a possible trauma response, even though he minimizes the event. This could warrant an unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder. His multiple medical conditions, particularly MS, are also relevant to consider. For the fifth diagnosis, personality change secondary to TBI or MS might be appropriate, though he denies depressive symptoms, which limits that differential.

Given his explicit denial of trauma symptoms and that his drinking is already captured under alcohol use disorder, I'm leaning toward mild neurocognitive disorder from the documented head trauma as a more defensible fifth diagnosis. The bar assault doesn't seem to meet threshold for a formal stress disorder in his presentation. Between unspecified depressive disorder, anxiety, and adjustment disorder—all of which he denies having—none fit as well as considering the cognitive effects of his brain injury.

My final five diagnoses are: Bipolar I Disorder in full remission, severe alcohol use disorder in early remission, bipolar and related disorder secondary to MS with manic features, unspecified trauma and stressor-related disorder, and mild neurocognitive disorder from the TBI. The critical question is whether his mania stems primarily from bipolar illness or from the MS flare itself—the temporal association with his MS exacerbation and MS's known capacity to trigger secondary mania makes this distinction essential to clarify. itive Disorder due to Traumatic Brain Injury, without behavioral disturbance (F06.70)

The TBI history warrants inclusion given the documented cognitive effects, though it's mild and not currently causing significant behavioral issues. This completes the diagnostic picture alongside the primary mood disorder and substance use considerations.","1. Bipolar I Disorder, most recent episode manic, in full remission - F31.74

1003,"Neveah is a 14 year old girl that comes to her pediatrician with her mother (presently 4 months pregnant) due to “out of control behaviors at home.” The patient appears restless in the exam room and requiring redirection from her mother throughout the visit. The patient frequently punches her mother in the legs, and in the stomach, and the patient even threw her ipad at the pediatrician when she asked the patient what was upsetting her. Most of the patients psychiatric history is gathered from her mother, given how irritable the patient is during the exam. The mother reports Neveah was born 8 weeks pre-mature, spent about 1 month in the neonatal intensive care unit due to problems with breathing, and ultimately discharged home to her care at one month of age. The patient met developmental milestones on or near expected time, and was “clingy” when she was a toddler, but had no problems making friends in daycare and grade school. When patient was about 11 years of age, her biological father left the home to join the military, and has deployed ever since. Around 12 years of age, around summertime, the patient appeared much more talkative, energetic, and would go several days only needing about 3 hours of sleep at night. She was more impulsive during these times, and believed she had super powers to “make her friends get in trouble at school”, even when she was not at school herself. She was never tired the following day. During that same period, she had many temper tantrums throughout the day, almost every day of the week, that seemed disproportionate to circumstances, like having to have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich instead of a peanut butter and fluff sandwich. The tantrums would last several hours in a day. This pattern of behavior would last for several weeks at a time, with periods of months returning to normal mood and behavior. The patient never appeared to be hallucination or responding to internal stimuli, and never appeared sad or depressed. Neveah had to be hospitalized during an episode like this when she was 13 years old. Neveah refuses to take medications for her symptoms. The start of this year academic year, that patient appeared more calm and in good behavioral control, but began to have similar symptoms of irritability, violence at home, not needing to sleep, talking fast, and property destruction at home.","Bipolar disorder, current episode manic (F31.2)",,judah_weathers,,,,"Let me carefully analyze this clinical case vignette to develop a differential diagnosis.

Psychiatric History - Episode Pattern:

**First notable episode around age 12 (summertime):**
- Much more talkative
- Increased energy
- Decreased need for sleep (only 3 hours/night for several days)
- NOT tired the following day
- Increased impulsivity
- Grandiose delusions: believed she had ""super powers to make her friends get in trouble at school"" even when not at school
- Multiple temper tantrums throughout the day, almost every day
- Tantrums disproportionate to circumstances
- Tantrums lasted several hours per day
- Episode lasted several weeks

**Hospitalization at age 13** for similar episode

**Current episode (start of academic year):**
- Had period of being calm and good behavioral control
- Now experiencing:
  - Irritability
  - Violence at home
  - Decreased need for sleep
  - Rapid speech
  - Property destruction

**Negative symptoms:**
- Never appeared to be hallucinating or responding to internal stimuli


- No depressive symptoms noted during evaluations

**Treatment:**
- Refuses to take medications

**Differential Diagnosis Analysis:**

1. **Bipolar I Disorder, Current Episode Manic** (F31.1-F31.2)
This diagnosis fits the clinical picture well. The pattern shows distinct episodes separated by months of normal functioning, with each episode featuring decreased sleep without fatigue, elevated talkativeness, increased energy, and psychotic-level grandiosity (believing she has super powers). She's had multiple episodes across three separate years, and the current presentation mirrors previous manic episodes with irritability, aggression, and decreased sleep need. The delusional belief about her powers causing peer conflicts even when absent indicates psychotic features within the manic episode.

2. **Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD)** (F34.81)
While severe temper outbursts occurring multiple times weekly with persistent irritability between episodes could suggest DMDD, several factors argue against it. The episodic pattern with complete baseline recovery for months contradicts DMDD's chronic course. Additionally, the decreased sleep need, rapid speech, and grandiose delusions aren't features of DMDD. The onset also appears after age 10, which doesn't meet DMDD criteria.

3. **Bipolar II Disorder** - Less likely because the episodes appear to meet full criteria for mania (not just hypomania) - particularly the psychotic features (grandiose delusions), hospitalization required, and severity of impairment.

4. **Oppositional Defiant Behavior** (F91.3)
Angry mood, argumentative behavior, and vindictiveness are present, but these should not be diagnosed separately if they occur exclusively during mood episodes.

5. **Conduct Disorder** (F91.1 or F91.2)
Physical aggression and property destruction occur, yet again, if these behaviors are confined to mood episodes, a separate diagnosis isn't appropriate.

6. **ADHD** - The impulsivity and restlessness could suggest this, but the episodic nature with clear periods of normal functioning argues against primary ADHD. The pattern of distinct episodes with symptom-free intervals doesn't align with ADHD's persistent course.

7. **Adjustment Disorder** - While stressors like the father's departure and mother's pregnancy are present, the symptom presentation doesn't match this diagnosis well.

8. **Intermittent Explosive Disorder** (F63.81) - Aggressive outbursts might point here, but the accompanying mood symptoms (reduced sleep need, increased speech, grandiosity, elevated energy) better explain this as bipolar disorder rather than a primary aggression disorder.

The episodic presentation with distinct manic features—decreased sleep need, increased talkativeness, grandiose delusions about possessing superpowers, impulsivity, and heightened energy—combined with psychotic symptoms, clear periods of normal functioning between episodes, and the need for hospitalization across multiple occurrences points to Bipolar I Disorder as the primary diagnosis.

Secondary considerations include unspecified or other specified bipolar presentations if diagnostic criteria aren't fully met, DMDD though age criteria may not align, ODD and conduct disorder if symptoms extend beyond mood episodes, and intermittent explosive disorder as a less likely alternative given the broader mood episode context. The episodic presentation with manic symptoms and grandiose delusions points clearly to Bipolar I Disorder, current episode manic with psychotic features as the primary diagnosis. For comorbid or differential considerations, Conduct Disorder fits given the aggression and property destruction, while Oppositional Defiant Disorder could apply if defiant patterns persist outside manic episodes. ADHD warrants consideration due to impulsivity, though the episodic nature makes this less likely than the mood disorder explanation. 91.3

Pertinent Negatives:
- No history of depression or mania
- Was in usual state of health until the traumatic event
- Denies disorganized speech
- Denies thought insertion or thought broadcasting
- Denies visual or auditory hallucinations

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

The clinical picture strongly suggests a trauma-related disorder following a clearly identified traumatic event (witnessing death, attempting to save a life).

Key DSM-5-TR criteria considerations:

1. **PTSD with Dissociative Symptoms (Depersonalization/Derealization subtype)**


- Criterion A is met: direct exposure to actual death ✓
- Criterion B satisfied: recurrent intrusive images and nightmares ✓
- Criterion C present: avoidance of driving as an external reminder ✓
- Criterion D (negative mood/cognition alterations): persistent dread suggests this component ✓
- Criterion E clearly demonstrated: exaggerated startle and sleep disruption ✓
- Duration approaching the one-month threshold needed for PTSD diagnosis
- Depersonalization/derealization features are prominent, indicating the dissociative subtype

At 27 days post-trauma, Acute Stress Disorder becomes the more technically accurate diagnosis since PTSD requires symptoms persisting beyond 30 days. The presentation includes symptoms spanning intrusion, negative mood, dissociation, avoidance, and arousal clusters. The depersonalization experience is particularly significant here. If dissociative symptoms become the primary focus rather than trauma response, Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder could be considered, though this seems less likely given the clear trauma context. Other diagnostic possibilities include Unspecified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder or Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety, depending on symptom severity and functional impairment. The dissociative symptoms—feeling detached from her body and observing herself from outside—point toward either Acute Stress Disorder or PTSD with dissociative features. At 27 days post-trauma, she's right at the boundary of the one-month cutoff for ASD, making PTSD technically more appropriate if we're being strict about timing. Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder should be considered given her specific experience of ""hallucinating,"" though this appears secondary to the trauma rather than primary. Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety is less likely given the intensity of her presentation, and an unspecified trauma-related diagnosis would only apply if criteria weren't substantially met—which they are. The timeline places this squarely within Acute Stress Disorder's window, making F43.0 the primary diagnosis. However, if the presentation meets full PTSD criteria despite the early timeframe, F43.11 (acute PTSD) would be the appropriate code rather than the unspecified variant. The dissociative component—particularly the depersonalization experience the patient initially described as hallucinations—could warrant a secondary diagnosis of depersonalization-derealization disorder (F48.1). Anxiety symptoms are prominent enough to consider F41.9 as well, though this would likely be secondary to the trauma-related diagnoses. The trauma-and stressor-related category also offers F43.89 for presentations that don't fit neatly into the primary categories. Actually, the dissociative symptoms are clearly part of the trauma response itself, so listing Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder separately doesn't fit—it would be excluded if these symptoms occur within the context of PTSD. Let me reconsider the differential more carefully. Acute Stress Disorder remains the primary diagnosis given the timeline and symptom presentation. Post-traumatic stress disorder, unspecified would be the likely progression if reassessed after a month. Adjustment disorder with anxiety could apply if full ASD criteria aren't met, though the clear traumatic trigger and symptom severity make this less probable. Generalized anxiety disorder is less fitting given the identifiable stressor, despite the prominent anxiety component. The dissociative features should be understood as secondary to the trauma rather than a separate disorder.","1. Acute stress disorder - F43.0

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

The clinical picture shows clear psychotic features—multiple delusions and auditory hallucinations—alongside negative symptoms spanning 2.5 months. Schizophreniform disorder fits well given the symptom duration falls within the 1-6 month window. He demonstrates multiple first-rank symptoms: persecutory delusions, auditory hallucinations, and negative symptoms like avolition and social withdrawal.

Other diagnoses don't align as well. Brief psychotic disorder requires symptoms to resolve within a month, but his have persisted for 2.5 months. Schizophrenia would need six months of symptoms including prodromal features, which he hasn't reached yet—though this could be his trajectory. Delusional disorder doesn't fit because he has prominent hallucinations. The negative urine drug screen and absence of medical explanations support a primary psychotic disorder rather than substance-induced or medical causes. Condition** - no medical history or neurological findings to suggest this, though additional evaluation would be warranted to completely exclude it.

Given the 2.5-month symptom duration with clear psychotic features (delusions and hallucinations) alongside some negative symptoms, schizophreniform disorder appears most likely. If symptoms persist beyond six months, the diagnosis would shift to schizophrenia. Major depressive disorder with psychotic features remains a secondary consideration given the depressive components, though the psychotic symptoms seem primary rather than mood-dependent. Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum disorder could apply if the presentation remains unclear, and adjustment disorder warrants consideration given the recent job loss stressor. withdrawal) and a 2.5-month timeline. The depressive features—hypersomnia, fatigue, poor concentration, reduced motivation—likely represent negative symptoms rather than a primary mood disorder, given how the psychosis dominates the clinical picture.

My top diagnostic considerations are Schizophreniform Disorder as the leading diagnosis, with Schizophrenia as a possibility if symptoms extend beyond six months. Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features remains on the differential but seems secondary to the psychotic presentation. and Delusional Disorder doesn't fit well either since there are hallucinations and other psychotic symptoms beyond just delusions.

My final ranking: Schizophreniform Disorder is the primary consideration given the 2.5-month timeline. Schizophrenia could be emerging if symptoms persist. I'd also consider Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder as a fallback, Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features given the mood component, and Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder if the presentation doesn't align perfectly with standard criteria.","1.

**Data Extraction and Organization:**

Demographics:
- 54-year-old female Navy Veteran

Chief Complaint:
- ""I feel like bugs are crawling all over me"" (tactile hallucinations/formication)

Timeline:
- Symptoms started ~36 hours ago
- Following elective surgery (tummy tuck)
- Has been on bed rest per surgeon's orders

Current Symptoms:
- Tactile hallucinations (formication - bugs crawling sensation)
- Excessive thirst (polydipsia)
- Tremor (""shaking like a leaf"")
- Denies visual or auditory hallucinations
- Denies depressed mood

Substance Use History:
- Alcohol: Reports 4-5 beers daily (likely underreporting given other context)
- Benzodiazepines: Clonazepam (Klonopin) use for ~15 years
  - PCP stopped prescribing 1 year ago
  - Now obtaining from ""online dispensary"" (illicit source)
  - Uses with alcohol in morning ""to keep the shakes down""
- Previous urine toxicology positive for: alcohol, benzodiazepines, opiates, amphetamines
- No legitimate prescriptions for opiates or amphetamines (suggesting illicit use)

Pattern of Use:
- Drinks more over past year to achieve similar effect (tolerance)
- Failed attempts to cut back on alcohol
- Family/friends concerned it's ""taking over her life""
- Morning use to prevent withdrawal symptoms

Social History:
- Lives alone
- Social isolation (""lost a lot of friends"")
- Stays home, orders delivery food

Medical History:
- Denies head trauma, strokes, seizures
- Recent elective surgery (tummy tuck)

Lab Findings:
- Severely low sodium (hyponatremia)


- Severely low potassium (hypokalemia)

**Clinical Interpretation:**

The presentation strongly suggests alcohol and/or benzodiazepine withdrawal triggered by surgical interruption of her substance access. The 36-hour timeline aligns with when she couldn't obtain her usual alcohol and illicit benzodiazepines, and the tremor with formication are hallmark withdrawal manifestations. The electrolyte derangements—both hyponatremia and hypokalemia—are consistent with chronic alcohol use disorder and likely exacerbated by poor nutritional intake and the physiologic stress of surgery.

**Differential Diagnosis:**

The most likely diagnosis is alcohol withdrawal progressing toward delirium tremens, given the classic symptom cluster of autonomic hyperactivity, tactile hallucinations, and the precise timing relative to substance cessation. Her 15-year benzodiazepine dependence compounds this risk significantly, as concurrent sedative withdrawal would amplify the severity and complicate management. Stimulant intoxication is unlikely given her bed rest status and the predominance of withdrawal-type symptoms rather than sympathomimetic effects. the tactile hallucinations suggest possible progression toward delirium tremens, though the benzodiazepine use complicates the picture since withdrawal from both substances can occur simultaneously.

The primary acute diagnosis is alcohol withdrawal with perceptual disturbances (F10.232). Underlying this are severe alcohol use disorder (F10.20) with clear tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, and continued use despite consequences, and moderate-to-severe benzodiazepine use disorder (F13.20) involving long-term illicit acquisition and self-medication. Additional diagnoses include stimulant and opioid use disorders based on prior positive toxicology screens. disorder, moderate - F13.20
4. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal - F13.230
5. Other stimulant use disorder - F15.10 or opioid use disorder F11.10

I'm reconsidering the diagnostic hierarchy. F10.232 specifically denotes alcohol dependence with withdrawal accompanied by perceptual disturbances, which already encompasses both the acute withdrawal state and the underlying substance use disorder. This single code captures the full clinical picture rather than requiring separate diagnoses for the disorder and withdrawal state. The distinction between F10.20 (uncomplicated dependence), F10.231 (withdrawal without perceptual disturbances), and F10.232 (withdrawal with perceptual disturbances) means I should select the most specific code that reflects her current presentation.

For benzodiazepines, the options parallel the alcohol coding: F13.20 for the use disorder itself, F13.230 for uncomplicated withdrawal, and F13.232 for withdrawal with perceptual disturbances. Since she may be experiencing concurrent benzodiazepine withdrawal, I need to determine which applies. Stimulant use disorder ranges from F15.10 (mild) to F15.20 (moderate/severe), while opioid use disorder similarly spans F11.10 (mild) to F11.20 (moderate/severe).

Prioritizing the diagnoses: alcohol withdrawal with perceptual disturbances takes the primary position at F10.232. Benzodiazepine use disorder and withdrawal considerations follow, with F13.232 being most appropriate if perceptual disturbances are present. For the stimulant and opioid use disorders, I'm coding them as mild (F15.10 and F11.10) given the limited clinical information available about their severity.

The fifth diagnosis is less clear—anxiety disorder seems speculative given her denial of depressed mood, though the chronic benzodiazepine use and social isolation warrant consideration. Rather than defaulting to an unspecified anxiety diagnosis, I should evaluate whether the polysubstance pattern itself is the dominant clinical presentation that needs emphasis, or if there's a more specific disorder that better captures her presentation. dence with withdrawal with perceptual disturbance - F10.232, along with sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic dependence with withdrawal - F13.230. The opioid and stimulant use disorders from the toxicology are coded as mild presentations. For the fifth diagnosis, I'm reconsidering whether an unspecified anxiety disorder is truly warranted given the case doesn't establish a clear anxiety condition separate from substance-induced effects. The social isolation and lost relationships could suggest adjustment disorder or social anxiety, but there isn't sufficient information about timelines or specific stressors to support those diagnoses confidently. The substance use itself may adequately explain her social difficulties, so I should evaluate whether a fifth psychiatric diagnosis adds meaningful clinical information or simply duplicates what the use disorders already capture.

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

1. **Alcohol-Induced Major Neurocognitive Disorder (Alcohol-Related Dementia)**
The patient has:
- 37 years of heavy alcohol use
- Medical complications from alcohol (liver failure)


- Progressive cognitive decline over 2 years with memory loss and impaired executive function
- Significant functional deterioration in daily activities
- Confabulation, which is characteristic of Korsakoff syndrome and indicates damage to memory systems from chronic alcohol exposure
- Gait disturbance potentially stemming from cerebellar atrophy or prior Wernicke encephalopathy

The confabulation pattern is particularly significant—it's a classic marker of Korsakoff syndrome within the Wernicke-Korsakoff spectrum. While Wernicke's typically presents acutely with confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia,

Korsakoff syndrome manifests with confabulation and anterograde amnesia. The appropriate DSM-5-TR diagnosis would be F10.27 for alcohol-induced major neurocognitive disorder with the amnestic-confabulatory type.

Additionally, there's a 2-year history of depressed mood with anhedonia, reduced motivation, and passive suicidal ideation. The irritability and low engagement could represent a separate Major Depressive Disorder, though mood symptoms frequently overlap with neurocognitive presentations, making it difficult to determine whether depression is independent or secondary to the cognitive decline.

The clinical picture—urinary incontinence, gait problems, and cognitive deterioration without acute CT findings—also raises consideration of Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus, which presents with the classic triad of gait disturbance, incontinence, and dementia. While this is primarily a neurological rather than psychiatric diagnosis, it's worth noting in the differential. Given the patient's age of 71, vascular contributions to cognitive decline should also be considered as part of the overall neurocognitive picture. Alcohol-Induced Major Neurocognitive Disorder, Amnestic-Confabulatory Type (F10.26) fits best given the chronic heavy drinking history, confabulation pattern characteristic of Korsakoff syndrome, and gait disturbances. Even though the patient achieved sobriety 6 years ago, the persistent and progressive nature of this condition means the diagnosis remains valid—Korsakoff syndrome doesn't resolve simply with abstinence. The specific code depends on whether perceptual disturbances are present, but F10.26 captures the core presentation without additional features. The depressive symptoms warrant a separate diagnosis since they emerged alongside the cognitive decline. Major Depressive Disorder, single episode seems fitting given the suicidal ideation and severity. I should consider whether these are independent of the neurocognitive disorder or manifestations of it, but coding them separately captures the clinical presentation more completely.

For my final diagnostic formulation: F10.27 captures the alcohol-induced amnestic-confabulatory presentation with Korsakoff syndrome features—the confabulation, memory loss, heavy drinking history, and gait disturbance all align. F32.2 addresses the depressive symptoms with suicidal ideation as a distinct but concurrent condition. F10.26 seems most appropriate for the amnestic-confabulatory presentation. Major Depressive Disorder remains relevant given the 2-year history of anhedonia, low motivation, and depressed mood. Vascular or Alzheimer's-type neurocognitive disorders should be considered as differential diagnoses, particularly if neuroimaging shows relevant findings. The alcohol use disorder itself is in sustained remission after 6 years of abstinence. The primary diagnosis should be **F10.26** for alcohol-induced amnestic disorder (Korsakoff syndrome). Secondary diagnoses include **F32.2** for the severe depressive episode, **F01.51** for vascular dementia with behavioral disturbance as a differential consideration, and **F02.81** for dementia related to other medical conditions. **F10.21** captures the alcohol use disorder itself in sustained remission. I need to verify the precise coding distinctions—F10.26 specifically denotes alcohol dependence with persisting amnestic disorder, while F10.27 applies to alcohol-induced persisting dementia, and F10.97 relates to unspecified alcohol use patterns.

Looking at the clinical presentation more carefully: the memory gaps, executive dysfunction affecting navigation and safety awareness, prominent confabulation, functional decline, gait disturbance, and incontinence paint a picture broader than isolated amnesia. This constellation suggests a major neurocognitive disorder rather than pure amnestic syndrome, making F10.27 potentially more fitting. Yet the confabulation pattern is distinctly characteristic of Korsakoff presentation, which points back toward F10.26.

Considering that Korsakoff syndrome can evolve into more diffuse cognitive impairment across multiple domains, I'm settling on F10.26 given how prominently confabulation features in this case. The gait abnormality and incontinence also raise the possibility of normal pressure hydrocephalus, but since the question limits to F-codes, that differential doesn't change the coding approach here.

The secondary diagnoses worth considering include major depression with passive suicidal ideation over the past month (F32.2), vascular dementia given his age and alcohol-related cardiovascular risk factors (F01.51), and dementia from other classified conditions like NPH if that's the underlying etiology (F02.81).

Regarding alcohol use disorder in sustained remission for six years—this remains a relevant psychiatric diagnosis despite remission status, capturing important historical context. However, I should also explore whether unspecified dementia codes (F03.90 or F03.91) might be more appropriate if the specific etiology remains unclear, or whether Alzheimer's type dementia warrants consideration in the differential.

My final diagnostic list prioritizes alcohol-induced major neurocognitive disorder as the primary concern given the clinical presentation, followed by major depressive disorder, vascular dementia with behavioral features, dementia in other classified diseases, and the historical alcohol use disorder in remission. I need to verify the DSM-5-TR coding conventions for substance-induced neurocognitive disorders to ensure accuracy. with my final answer. The key codes are F10.26 for the alcohol-induced neurocognitive disorder with confabulation, F32.2 for the severe depression, F01.51 for vascular dementia with behavioral disturbance, F02.81 for dementia in other diseases with behavioral disturbance, and F10.21 for alcohol use disorder in sustained remission.

Looking back at the presentation, the confabulation really stands out as the defining feature—it's characteristic of Korsakoff syndrome. Combined with decades of heavy drinking, the gait problems suggesting past cerebellar or Wernicke involvement, and the memory loss, this clearly indicates alcohol-induced neurocognitive disorder. The dep

The depressive symptoms are also important and need their own diagnosis given the suicidal ideation. I should consider whether F10.27 (persisting dementia) fits better than F10.26 (amnestic-confabulatory type). The patient shows both memory impairment with confabulation and broader cognitive dysfunction like executive problems with navigation and forgetting the stove, which could suggest the wider cognitive decline of F10.27. But the confabulation remains the most striking feature, pointing toward F10.26 as the classic Korsakoff presentation. In actual clinical settings, Korsakoff syndrome often progresses into broader alcoholic dementia, so the codes overlap somewhat. I'll use F10.26 since it best captures the distinctive confabulatory pattern, though F10.27 would also work.

I should also weigh whether the depression stems from the neurocognitive disorder itself rather than being a separate major depressive disorder. That could point to F06.32 (depressive disorder due to another medical condition). But since the patient independently reports feeling depressed, I'll maintain F32.2 as a distinct diagnosis.

The remaining diagnoses address the vascular and other medical contributions to dementia, along with the alcohol use disorder in remission. F01.51 and F02.81 capture behavioral disturbances from vascular and other medical etiologies, while F10.21 reflects the severe alcohol use disorder that's currently sustained in remission.","1.

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

Clear alcohol use disorder with decades of heavy consumption, medical sequelae, and documented withdrawal phenomena. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome is likely given the 5-day abstinence window and history of severe withdrawal symptoms. The psychotic features and paranoia emerged roughly 2 weeks ago, coinciding with the drinking reduction attempt, which could reflect either alcohol hallucinosis or an underlying primary psychotic disorder being unmasked by decreased substance use.

Prior manic episode with classic features—markedly decreased sleep need, elevated mood, flight of ideas, pressured speech—warranting consideration of bipolar disorder. Current depressive presentation fits a potential depressive phase of this illness.

Trauma exposure with intrusive recollections, nightmares, and behavioral avoidance suggests PTSD. The combination of mood instability, psychotic symptoms, and trauma history raises the question of whether schizoaffective disorder might better account for the constellation of symptoms, particularly if psychotic features persist beyond the acute withdrawal period.

The temporal relationship between reducing alcohol intake and onset of auditory hallucinations points toward alcohol withdrawal psychosis as a primary consideration. This would take precedence in the diagnostic hierarchy given the clear timeline. Major depression with psychotic features is less likely given the prior manic episode, making bipolar disorder the more probable mood diagnosis if mood symptoms persist after withdrawal resolves. chotic symptoms plus mood episodes, along with alcohol-related factors. The timeline is crucial here—the hallucinations emerged precisely when the patient began reducing alcohol intake 2 weeks ago, and they've persisted even 5 days after the last drink. Yet the first-rank symptoms like thought insertion and negative commentary hallucinations, combined with the documented manic episode requiring hospitalization 2 years prior, point toward an underlying primary psychotic or mood disorder rather than simple withdrawal. I'm weighing whether this represents Bipolar I with psychotic features during a depressive phase, Schizoaffective Disorder, or an alcohol-induced presentation superimposed on an existing condition.

The diagnostic hierarchy matters significantly—alcohol use disorder with severe withdrawal is clearly established, but I need to determine if the current psychosis is fundamentally alcohol-driven or reflects an independent psychiatric illness. The temporal coincidence of symptom onset with alcohol reduction is notable, yet the quality and persistence of the psychotic features suggest something more primary.

Bipolar I remains high on the differential given the documented manic episode with hospitalization and current depressive presentation, though I should clarify whether any psychotic symptoms are mood-congruent. PTSD from his trauma history also warrants consideration given the flashbacks and hypervigilance. The thought insertion and hallucinations could align with alcohol-induced psychosis, schizoaffective disorder, or a primary psychotic disorder—the timing relative to drinking changes is the key discriminator here. olar I seems most comprehensive given the prior manic episode and current depressive presentation with possible psychotic features, though the strong connection between alcohol use and psychosis warrants consideration of an alcohol-induced psychotic disorder. Schizoaffective disorder could also account for the persistent psychotic symptoms alongside mood disturbance. The final diagnostic picture includes Bipolar I Disorder, current depressed episode with psychotic features (F31.5), Severe Alcohol Use Disorder (F10.20), PTSD (F43.10), Alcohol-Induced Psychotic Disorder with Hallucinations (F10.251), and Schizoaffective Disorder, Depressive type (F25.1) as differential considerations.

The paranoid ideation about being attacked and harassed requires careful assessment—whether these represent delusions or legitimate concerns—and the thought insertion symptom is particularly notable since it typically appears in schizophrenia spectrum conditions rather than primary mood disorders. The alcohol use disorder remains clearly established, and the potential for alcohol withdrawal adds another layer to the clinical picture that needs monitoring. The patient's presentation suggests alcohol withdrawal is a significant factor given the timeline of 5 days since last use combined with their documented history of severe withdrawal episodes. F10.232 captures this more precisely than the uncomplicated code. I should also reconsider the diagnostic hierarchy—the alcohol-induced psychotic features might better explain the current presentation than attributing them solely to bipolar disorder with psychosis. The schizoaffective diagnosis needs careful consideration against the primary mood disorder diagnosis, particularly given the temporal relationship to substance use and withdrawal.","1.

**Data Extraction and Organization:**

Demographics:
- 16-year-old female
- Sophomore in high school
- Active in lacrosse and ballet

Living situation:
- Lives with two mothers, older brother, and dog
- Stable home environment indicated

Presenting symptoms and behaviors:

1. Eating behaviors:
- Skips lunch most days
- Breakfast: only a sliced apple
- Dinner: takes only vegetable portion to bedroom, eats slowly over 3 hours
- Aims to eat less than 1000 calories per day (severe caloric restriction)

2. Exercise behaviors:
- Goes to gym for about 3 hours every day
- Does about 2.5 hours of cardiovascular training daily
- Also participates in lacrosse and ballet
- This represents excessive exercise

3. Menstrual history:
- Menarche at 13.5 years
- Has missed 3 of her last periods (secondary amenorrhea)
- This suggests physiological impact of malnutrition

4. GI symptoms:
- Reports significant gastric reflux (wakes her at night)
- Reports constipation (""I don't really have bowel movements anymore"")
- Uses laxatives morning and night (laxative abuse)

5. Psychiatric symptoms denied:
- No depressed, sad, or hopeless mood
- No excessive worry or panic
- (Note: denial of psychiatric symptoms is common in anorexia nervosa)

6. Sleep:
- Disturbed by gastric reflux at night

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

Primary consideration: Anorexia Nervosa

DSM-5-TR criteria for Anorexia Nervosa:
A. Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements, leading to a significantly low body weight in the context of age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health. - YES (severe caloric restriction <1000 cal/day, skipping meals, eating only vegetables)


B. Intense fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, or persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain, even though at a significantly low weight. - Inferred from the compulsive exercise regimen (3+ hours daily), rigid dietary restriction, and twice-daily laxative use, all suggesting active weight control behaviors. C. Disturbance in the way one's body weight or shape is experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation, or persistent lack of recognition of the seriousness of the current low body weight. - Not directly articulated but the restrictive and compensatory behaviors imply body image disturbance. The secondary amenorrhea (missing 3 periods) represents a clear physiological consequence of severe nutritional deficit and hypothalamic suppression.

Additional physical markers of malnutrition include constipation from inadequate caloric intake and gastric reflux potentially stemming from delayed gastric emptying. The laxative misuse twice daily is significant—while she doesn't report binge eating episodes, the DSM-5-TR criteria for binge-eating/purging type includes purging behaviors such as laxative misuse independent of binge eating. This would classify her presentation as the binge-eating/purging subtype rather than the restricting type.

Without her actual weight or BMI, I'm relying on the secondary amenorrhea as a strong indicator of significant underweight status and malnutrition. The primary diagnosis appears to be Anorexia Nervosa, Binge-eating/Purging type, given the combination of severe restriction, compulsive exercise, and regular purging through laxatives. I should also consider whether Anorexia Nervosa, Restricting type might apply if the laxative use is determined to be less central to her presentation.

Other possibilities include atypical anorexia nervosa if her weight doesn't meet the ""significantly low"" threshold, though her amenorrhea suggests otherwise. Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder seems less fitting given the apparent weight and shape preoccupation driving her behaviors. Bulimia Nervosa is unlikely without documented binge episodes.

The most compelling diagnosis remains Anorexia Nervosa, Binge-eating/Purging type, given the combination of severe restriction, compulsive exercise, and laxative misuse as a purging mechanism. The secondary amenorrhea further supports significant physiological compromise from the eating disorder. While she denies mood or anxiety concerns, these frequently accompany eating disorders and may be minimized or unrecognized by the patient. I need to clarify whether the laxative use represents genuine constipation management or intentional purging for weight control. The constipation itself likely stems from her severe restriction, but taking laxatives twice daily suggests compensatory behavior rather than medical necessity. Given her pattern of multiple weight-control strategies—extreme caloric restriction and excessive exercise—using laxatives for weight management fits more logically with her overall presentation.

The DSM-5-TR criteria support Binge-Eating/Purging type when purging behaviors occur regularly over three months, even without concurrent binge episodes. Since she demonstrates recurrent laxative misuse during this timeframe, this subtype applies.

The differential includes Restricting type if laxative use were incidental, Bulimia Nervosa if binge episodes were primary, and ARFID or Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder if the clinical picture didn't meet full anorexia criteria—but her presentation clearly aligns with the Binge-Eating/Purging subtype.","1.

For ICD-10 F-codes for DSM-5-TR diagn

The primary presentation fits Borderline Personality Disorder (F60.3) given the unstable relationships, recurrent self-harm, suicidal responses to perceived abandonment, intense emotional dysregulation, and long-standing pattern since adolescence. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (F43.10 or F43.12 for chronic) is clearly indicated by the trauma history with intrusion, avoidance, and arousal symptoms. The differential also considers other personality disorder presentations, though information is limited. PTSD coding options include F43.11 if dissociative symptoms are present or F43.12 for the chronic course. backs, nightmares, and hypervigilance all point to PTSD as a clear comorbid diagnosis. Major Depressive Disorder doesn't fit since she denies depressive symptoms and her irritability appears situational rather than a mood disorder. Bipolar disorder is ruled out by absence of manic episodes, and she denies substance use. Complex PTSD isn't a DSM-5-TR diagnosis. Adjustment disorder could apply but doesn't capture the full clinical picture as well as the personality pathology and trauma response do.

The primary diagnoses are Borderline Personality Disorder and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, with strong evidence for both. For additional considerations: Persistent Depressive Disorder might be relevant given her chronic suicidal ideation, though she denies current depressive symptoms. Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder could account for symptoms that don't fully meet PTSD criteria. ressed mood - F43.21. But she explicitly denies depressive symptoms, so adding depressive diagnoses seems inconsistent with her presentation. The suicidal behavior pattern and self-harm history point more directly to BPD and PTSD as primary concerns. I should prioritize diagnoses that capture the trauma response and personality pathology rather than assuming a depressive disorder when she's not endorsing mood symptoms. PTSD with the complexity of her presentation might warrant an unspecified trauma-related diagnosis to fully account for her clinical picture, and I could consider other specified depressive disorder only if there's evidence of a depressive episode with incomplete criteria. The core diagnoses remain BPD and PTSD, with personality disorder features potentially extending beyond borderline traits. PTSD: F43.10 ✓
- Adjustment Disorder: F43.20 seems most fitting given the acute stressor
- Depressive Disorders: F32.89 captures the depressive features better than unspecified
- Other specified trauma-related: F43.89 as an alternative

The primary diagnosis should be Borderline Personality Disorder - F60.3, given the pattern of unstable relationships, identity disturbance, and impulsive behaviors that form the core presentation.

PTSD - F43.10 appears as a secondary diagnosis with clear diagnostic criteria met. The adjustment disorder framework doesn't adequately capture her symptomatology since the presentation aligns more closely with the personality pathology and trauma response. I'd also consider unspecified depressive disorder given the suicidal ideation, though this may be secondary to the personality disorder itself rather than a primary mood disorder. F43.20
5. Persistent Depressive Disorder - F34.1

The most clinically salient diagnoses to consider are BPD with strong support, PTSD as a clear comorbidity, and depressive disorders—though she denies meeting full MDD criteria, the chronic suicidality warrants consideration, particularly since suicidal behavior in BPD frequently occurs without complete depressive syndrome. Bipolar disorder, complex PTSD, and substance use are less likely given the clinical picture. This narrows the primary diagnoses to Borderline Personality Disorder (F60.3) and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (F43.10), with depressive features captured through Other Specified Depressive Disorder (F32.89) rather than listing multiple overlapping depressive diagnoses. Adjustment Disorder (F43.20) and Persistent Depressive Disorder (F34.1) round out the differential, though I should reconsider whether all five diagnoses are truly clinically necessary or if some are redundant.

Looking more carefully at what the presentation actually supports: BPD and PTSD are clearly indicated by the clinical picture. However, she explicitly denies depressive symptoms—her appetite, energy, motivation, and pleasure are all intact—which makes depressive disorders questionable additions. The acute crisis appears rooted in her BPD abandonment sensitivity rather than a primary mood disorder. While bipolar disorder, substance use, and psychotic disorders were ruled out, a focused differential should prioritize the diagnoses with strongest evidence rather than listing every possible consideration. related to the chronic suicidality and self-harm patterns, though these aren't yet formally coded in ICD-10. Considering the trauma history, dissociative features could also be relevant. The final differential includes Borderline Personality Disorder with PTSD as primary diagnoses, followed by adjustment and depressive disorders as secondary considerations.","1.

8. **Current Treatment:** Cymbalta (duloxetine) for depression, 5+ years

**Differential Diagnosis Analysis:**

1. **Major Depressive Disorder,

Recurrent, Moderate to Severe:**
   - Multiple depressive features present: hypersomnia, weight loss, concentration difficulties, psychomotor retardation, anhedonia, crying spells
   - Long-standing depression managed with Cymbalta for five years
   - Current symptoms suggest inadequate treatment response or breakthrough depression
   - Recent symptom onset indicates active episode

2. **Alcohol Use Disorder, Severe:**

   - Decades-long history with prior rehabilitation and recent relapse
   - Significant functional impairment

3. **

Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder** (F13.10)
   - Single 10mg Klonopin dose raises question of whether this represents acute intoxication or emerging misuse pattern
   - The benzodiazepine overdose warrants consideration in the diagnostic picture

Reviewing the relevant ICD-10 codes: alcohol use disorder severe maps to F10.20, major depressive disorder recurrent moderate to F33.1, and sedative/hypnotic use disorder mild to F13.10.

The clinical presentation suggests major depressive disorder recurrent moderate as the primary diagnosis given the constellation of depressive symptoms and documented history. Alcohol use disorder severe is supported by decades of use, prior treatment attempts, and current relapse. For the benzodiazepine component, the acute intoxication from the single Klonopin dose combined with ongoing misuse pattern points toward F13.229, capturing both the intoxication state and underlying use disorder. The severity of depression warrants consideration of F33.2 given the functional impairment and overdose attempt. Alcohol Use Disorder is clearly established at the severe level. The benzodiazepine overdose suggests either acute intoxication or possible misuse pattern with sedatives, which would code as F13.129 or F13.229 depending on whether a use disorder is present. Since alcohol intoxication was documented at the time of the overdose, this should be specified as F10.229 given the established severe use disorder. The primary diagnoses consolidate to Major Depressive Disorder (moderate to severe), Alcohol Use Disorder (severe), and the acute benzodiazepine intoxication event. The alcohol use disorder warrants a severe designation given the pattern of use and current intoxication. For the benzodiazepine exposure, I'm noting intoxication rather than use disorder since the presentation centers on acute overdose in context of the other substances. The alcohol intoxication code captures the current state alongside the underlying disorder. Anxiety symptoms remain present but unspecified without clearer diagnostic criteria, so I'm coding this conservatively. I should verify the ICD-10 codes align properly—F33.1 for the depression, F10.20 for alcohol severity, and F13.10 if documenting sedative-hypnotic involvement, though the acute intoxication codes may be more clinically relevant here. Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder, Mild to Moderate - F13.10 or F13.20. The alcohol intoxication should be coded as F10.229, and there's an unspecified anxiety disorder component (F41.9).

Looking at the depression more carefully, the clinical presentation suggests moderate severity rather than mild. The hypersomnia, significant weight loss over a short timeframe, concentration problems, psychomotor changes, anhedonia, and emotional distress are substantial symptoms. Though he denies hopelessness and hasn't expressed suicidal intent, the overall symptom burden and functional impact point toward F33.1 rather than a milder presentation.

Regarding the sedative misuse—taking 10 Klonopin while drinking appears to be an acute intoxication event rather than evidence of an established pattern. Without sufficient history of problematic use, I should code this as F13.929 for the intoxication itself. The final diagnoses would be Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate (F33.1); Alcohol Use Disorder, Severe (F10.20); Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Intoxication (F13.929); concurrent alcohol intoxication (F10.229); and Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9).

However, I'm reconsidering whether listing both the use disorder and intoxication codes for alcohol creates unnecessary redundancy. I should also explore whether other conditions better capture the clinical picture—Persistent Depressive Disorder if there's chronic underlying depression, Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood, or even Borderline Personality Disorder given the impulsivity and apparent fear of abandonment. The core diagnoses remain Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate and Alcohol Use Disorder, Severe, with the sedative intoxication as an acute complication. Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent Episode, Moderate - F33.1 seems most appropriate given the five-year history on Cymbalta indicating an established mood disorder. Alcohol Use Disorder, Severe - F10.20 and Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Intoxication - F13.929 capture the acute substance involvement. I'd also include Unspecified Anxiety Disorder - F41.9 and consider ruling out Borderline Personality Disorder - F60.3 given the impulsive overdose and abandonment concerns. The key question is whether current depressive symptoms represent an exacerbation of the underlying disorder or are primarily substance-induced, though the chronic Cymbalta use suggests the former. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder - F41.9

The adjustment disorder diagnosis would overlap too much with the recurrent major depression already identified as the primary mood disturbance, so the first formulation is more appropriate.","1. Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent Episode, Moderate - F33.1

1012,"Melanie is an 11 year old girl who was brought to urgent care by her mother after being sent home from school for “using racial slurs.” Melanie is the product of a full-term, uncomplicated pregnancy, vaginally delivered with normal APGAR (Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration) score at birth. Melanie used her first word “Momma” around 48 months of age, and didn’t start noticing other children playing with her until about 6 years old. Even at 6 years old, Melanie would not respond to her name when called, often appearing like she was in a daydream, and would often do a lot of “rocking” or “spinning” when anxious. Melanie’s mother indicates “Melanie is a unique kid. She doesn’t really make good eye contact with me, her father or her friends, and seems to be overly focused on doing puzzles all day. She has a hard time making friends, because all she wants to do is work on puzzles, and does little interactive play with others.” Melanies mother also indicates “if we take her puzzle away from her for dinner, she will have a complete ‘meltdown’ and be inconsolable for a good hour, ultimately leading to us having to give her the puzzle back.” Around 8 years of age, Melanie was found blinking her eyes repeatedly, and would say “I have to do it” whenever family questioned the eye blinking. The eye blinking slowly went away, but seemed to be replace by Melanie contorting her neck repeatedly, and especially when getting ready for school or leaving the house. Now, Melanie slaps herself in the head repeatedly when stressed, to the point that family has to adorn Melanie with soft gloves so she does not cause injury. About 13 months ago, Melanie start screaming out racial slurs when in the grocery store and school, and this would last for about 5 minutes in duration, until she was able to calm down. Otherwise, Melanie denied problems with sad, depressed or hopeless mood, nor problems with auditory or visual hallucinations. Melanies mother denied observations of bizarre rituals such as excessive handwashing, counting or organizing, but does report Melanie has a strong and persistent interest in puzzles.

**Data Extraction and Organization:**

**Demographic Information:**
- 11-year-old girl
- Brought to urgent care after being sent home from school for ""using racial slurs""

**Developmental History:**
- Full-term, uncomplicated pregnancy
- Normal vaginal delivery with normal APGAR scores
- First word ""Momma"" at ~48 months (significantly delayed - typical is 12 months)
- Didn't notice other children until about 6 years old (social development delay)

**Behavioral Symptoms - Social Communication:**
- Poor eye contact with parents and friends
- Does not respond to her name when called (appearing like in a daydream)
- Difficulty making friends
- Little interactive play with others

**Restricted/Repetitive Behaviors:**
- Overly focused on doing puzzles all day (restricted interest)
- ""Rocking"" or ""spinning"" when anxious (stereotyped behaviors)
- ""Meltdowns"" when puzzle is taken away - inconsolable for an hour (difficulty with transitions/changes)
- Strong and persistent interest in puzzles

**Motor/Vocal Tic History:**
- Age 8: Eye blinking repeatedly (motor tic) - would say ""I have to do it""
- Eye blinking replaced by neck contorting (motor tic evolution)
- Tics worse when getting ready for school or leaving (stress-related exacerbation)
- Current: Self-head slapping when stressed (could be complex motor tic or self-injurious behavior)
- 13 months ago: Started screaming racial slurs (coprolalia - vocal tic) lasting ~5 minutes until calmed

**Negative Findings:**
- No sad, depressed, or hopeless mood
- No auditory or visual hallucinations
- No bizarre rituals (handwashing, counting, organizing) - ruling out OCD


- No active thoughts, plans, or intent of harm to self or others

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

The clinical presentation strongly suggests autism spectrum disorder given the constellation of early developmental delays in language and social awareness, persistent social communication difficulties, and restricted repetitive behaviors centered on puzzles. The tic history beginning at age 8 with motor tics that evolved and worsened under stress, combined with the recent onset of coprolalia, points toward a concurrent tic disorder or Tourette's syndrome.

The motor tics (eye blinking, neck contorting, head slapping) and vocal tics including coprolalia have persisted well beyond one year, ruling out provisional tic disorder. The presence of both motor and vocal tics lasting this duration meets criteria for Tourette's disorder rather than a single-tic category. Coprolalia, though only occurring in a minority of Tourette's cases, is highly specific when present. Other differential diagnoses like OCD or medication side effects would need to be ruled out through further assessment. rocking, spinning), and difficulty with transitions.

2. **Tourette's Disorder (F95.2)** - Multiple motor tics progressing from eye blinking to neck contorting to head slapping, plus vocal tics including coprolalia, with onset before age 18 and duration exceeding one year.

3. **Unspecified Intellectual Disability (F79)** - Significant language delay with first words at 48 months suggests possible cognitive impairment, though formal testing hasn't been completed.

4. **Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9)** - Repetitive behaviors intensify when anxious, and tics escalate during stressful situations like school preparation, indicating an anxiety component.

5. **Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Presentation (F90.0)** - The ""daydream"" quality suggests possible inattention, though this could overlap with ASD characteristics.

The head slapping warrants consideration as either a complex motor tic within Tourette's, self-injurious behavior tied to autism, or potentially both occurring simultaneously. The coprolalia—specifically the racial slurs—is a particularly distinctive indicator of Tourette's Disorder. Given the clinical picture, the primary diagnoses appear to be Autism Spectrum Disorder (F84.0), Tourette's Disorder (F95.2), Unspecified Intellectual Disability (F79), and Anxiety Disorder Unspecified (F41.9).

For a fifth diagnosis, ADHD could be considered, though the presentation doesn't clearly support it. A Language Disorder (F80.2) might be more appropriate given the marked speech delay. Alternatively, Stereotypic Movement Disorder with self-injurious behavior (F98.4) could apply, though this diagnosis is typically reserved when the stereotypies are severe enough to warrant independent clinical attention and aren't better explained by another condition—in this case, the repetitive movements would likely fall under the autism diagnosis itself.

The head slapping warrants consideration as a distinct clinical concern. Given that it occurs specifically during stress and alongside other tic-like behaviors, it could represent a complex motor tic within the Tourette's framework rather than a separate stereotypic movement disorder. Self-injurious tics do occur in Tourette's Disorder, and the key distinction hinges on whether the behavior has the characteristic tic quality—sudden, rapid, recurrent, and non-rhythmic—versus the more rhythmic, self-soothing quality typical of stereotypies.

The premonitory sensation (""I have to do it"") points toward a tic mechanism, suggesting the head slapping should be understood as part of the Tourette's diagnosis rather than coded separately. This shifts the diagnostic focus away from Stereotypic Movement Disorder. For the remaining diagnostic slots, Language Disorder could be relevant given the documented speech delay, though ADHD remains a possibility given its frequent comorbidity with these conditions, even if not explicitly detailed in the presentation. The language delay is significant—first words at 48 months versus the typical 12-month milestone—which could suggest Language Disorder. But since language difficulties are typically subsumed within the ASD diagnosis itself, adding it as a separate condition may be redundant. I'm settling on the core diagnoses: Autism Spectrum Disorder as primary, Tourette's Disorder given the clear motor and vocal tics, Unspecified Intellectual Disability reflecting the cognitive delays, and Unspecified Anxiety Disorder for the anxious presentation. Language Disorder could be included, though it's often considered part of the autism picture rather than a distinct diagnosis.","1. Autism Spectrum Disorder - F84.0

1013,"Ben is a 12 month old infant that presented for a well check to their new pediatrician. Ben’s father indicates the Ben has been without any recent infections or sick exposures, and is up-to-date on immunizations. Ben’s father does recount that “Ben looks very different from our other children. His eyes seem to be space father apart, and his ears look much lower than his siblings when they were babies.” Ben’s father also indicates, “we have a hard time leaving him alone for more than 1 minute before he starts crying loudly; his cry sounds very much like a cat.” Ben was born at 4 lbs 5 oz and had to spend about 1 week in the neonatal intensive care unit for what Ben’s dad reports was “something to do with his heart; it was the wrong shape or something.” Ben has had to meet with a pediatric gastroenterologist since birth for problems related to feeding. Ben’s father reports they met with a geneticist about 2 weeks ago, and they are awaiting the results from that testing.

While this diagnosis can be made with the aforementioned clinical signs, confirmation is typically done by genetic testing, which is yet to be determined here.",judah_weathers,,,,"This clinical vignette describes a 12-month-old infant with several distinctive features that point toward a genetic syndrome. Let me analyze the key clinical findings:

Physical Features:
- Widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism)
- Low-set ears
- Small head (microcephaly)
- Small jaw (micrognathia)
- Low birth weight (4 lbs 5 oz - indicating intrauterine growth restriction)

Neurological/Developmental:
- Diffuse hypotonia
- High-pitched, cat-like cry (very distinctive finding)
- Excessive drooling

Cardiac:
- Congenital heart defect (spent time in NICU for ""wrong shape"" heart)
- Fixed splitting of second heart sound (suggests atrial septal defect)

GI:
- Feeding problems requiring pediatric gastroenterologist

The combination of:
1. High-pitched, cat-like cry
2. Microcephaly
3. Low birth weight
4. Hypertelorism
5. Low-set ears
6. Micrognathia
7. Congenital heart defect
8. Hypotonia
9. Feeding difficulties

This is a classic presentation of Cri-du-chat syndrome (5p deletion syndrome), which is caused by a partial deletion of chromosome 5p. The cat-like cry is pathognomonic for this condition.

Now, the question asks for DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses with F-codes. This is challenging because Cri-du-chat syndrome is primarily a genetic disorder, not a psychiatric diagnosis per se. However, it does fall under intellectual developmental disorders in the DSM-5-TR context.

Looking at F-codes:
- Intellectual Developmental Disorder would be expected with Cri-du-chat syndrome
- At 12 months, it may be too early to definitively diagnose intellectual disability, but Global Developmental Delay would be appropriate

DSM-5-TR relevant diagnoses:


Global Developmental Delay (F88) fits best for this age group when developmental milestones aren't being met but intellectual disability can't yet be reliably determined. The hypotonia and feeding difficulties support this diagnosis. Feeding Disorder of Infancy (F98.21) is also warranted given the documented feeding problems requiring specialist intervention. Unspecified Intellectual Developmental Disorder (F79) could be considered given the underlying genetic condition's expected trajectory, though it's premature for a definitive intellectual disability diagnosis at this age. Intake Disorder (F50.82) - For feeding problems. Separation anxiety is a consideration, though some separation distress is developmentally normal at this age.

The question asks specifically for DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses with F-codes. This presentation suggests Cri-du-chat syndrome, a chromosomal disorder that falls under psychiatric classification as a developmental condition. Global Developmental Delay (F88) is the primary diagnosis for children under 5 with developmental concerns, while Unspecified Intellectual Disability (F79) reflects the expected outcome of the genetic syndrome. Feeding difficulties warrant coding as an eating disorder (F50.82). specified Neurodevelopmental Disorder (F89) - Could capture other developmental concerns

Language disorder may be emerging though assessment is limited at this age. Looking at the ICD-10 codes more carefully, F88 represents other disorders of psychological development and aligns with Global Developmental Delay in DSM-5-TR, while F79 captures unspecified intellectual disability. For feeding issues, F50.89 (other specified feeding or eating disorder) applies. The primary diagnosis should be Global Developmental Delay (F88) given the age, with Intellectual Developmental Disorder, Unspecified Severity (F79) as secondary since genetic syndromes typically present with cognitive impairment.

The clinical picture—hypotonia, low birth weight, dysmorphic features, and feeding difficulties—all point toward developmental delays consistent with a genetic syndrome like Cri-du-chat. While cognitive assessment isn't explicitly documented, these physical markers reasonably support inferring developmental delay. The feeding problems warrant their own diagnosis (F50.82), and communication delays are likely given the syndrome presentation, though formal speech-language evaluation would be needed to confirm.","1.

Key Clinical Information:
- 23-year-old male
- Chief complaint: ""seeing white and black dots everywhere, like a static""
- Visual disturbances: light trails when looking at moving objects, ""halos"" around stationary objects
- Onset: After using ""a whole bunch of mushrooms"" at Burning Man when he was 19 (so approximately 4 years ago)
- No current substance use (denies alcohol, marijuana, PCP, hallucinogens)
- Describes himself as ""typically chill""
- Denies: depression, sleep changes, suicidal/homicidal ideation, manic symptoms, trauma history/PTSD symptoms, panic, OCD, social anxiety, generalized anxiety, head trauma, seizures, disorganized speech/thought, paranoia/persecution
- The experiences are not particularly distressing - he just wants to make sure he's okay
- Mother corroborates his complaints

Diagnostic Reasoning:

1. Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (HPPD) - This is the most likely diagnosis
- The patient has perceptual disturbances (visual snow/static, light trails, halos) that began after hallucinogen use (psilocybin mushrooms)
- The symptoms have persisted for approximately 4 years since the hallucinogen use
- He is not currently intoxicated with hallucinogens
- DSM-5-TR criteria for HPPD:
  A. Following cessation of use of a hallucinogen, the reexperiencing of one or more of the perceptual symptoms that were experienced while intoxicated with the hallucinogen (geometric hallucinations, false perceptions of movement in peripheral visual fields, flashes of color, intensified colors, trails of images of moving objects, positive afterimages, halos around objects, macropsia, micropsia)
  B. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment (note: he says it's not particularly distressing, but he's seeking medical attention)
  C. The disturbances aren't attributable to another medical condition or mental disorder, and they're not better explained by ongoing hallucinogen intoxication or withdrawal. The ICD-10 code is F16.983. Other diagnostic possibilities include unspecified hallucinogen-induced disorder (F16.99), though anxiety disorder, primary psychotic disorder, and medical causes of visual disturbance don't fit given his intact insight and absence of other psychotic or anxiety symptoms. Past hallucinogen use disorder should also be documented.

For the primary diagnosis, HPPD with flashbacks (F16.983) is most appropriate. Secondary codes might include unspecified hallucinogen-related disorder (F16.988) and possibly unspecified anxiety disorder (F41.9) given his presentation seeking reassurance, though he explicitly denies anxiety symptoms. The pattern of use—described as consuming a substantial quantity of mushrooms at a single occasion—appears to represent an isolated episode rather than a sustained use disorder pattern. let me finalize the diagnoses. The primary diagnosis is clearly hallucinogen persisting perception disorder with the F16.983 code. For secondary diagnoses, I should document the past hallucinogen use with F16.90, and consider whether anxiety warrants coding—he's seeking reassurance but denies significant distress, so an anxiety diagnosis may be borderline. I could also include other hallucinogen-related disorder codes depending on what best captures his presentation.

Looking at the differential more carefully, since he explicitly denies anxiety, I should reconsider whether to include anxiety disorders at all. Other conditions like visual snow syndrome and migraine with aura aren't DSM diagnoses, so they wouldn't be coded. Brief psychotic disorder, schizophrenia spectrum, and delusional disorder are all unlikely given the clear temporal relationship to hallucinogen use and absence of other psychotic features. Substance-induced psychotic disorder could be considered, though the persistent visual phenomena fit better with hallucinogen persisting perception disorder. My final list should prioritize the clearest diagnoses: the persisting perception disorder as primary, past use documentation, and potentially one additional code if clinically warranted. The differential is appropriately centered on hallucinogen-related conditions, with HPPD as the leading diagnosis given the clinical presentation and timeline.","1.

4. Decreased appetite (no reported weight loss)
5. Passive suicidal ideation - thoughts about ""how the world might be better without me in it"" but denies active suicidal ideation
6. Concentration problems - failing multiple exams
7. Hypersomnia - 10 hours of sleep but still tired during the day

Behavioral Symptoms:

4. Bullying younger siblings

Mental Status Observations:
- Calm and in good behavioral control in exam room

Denied:
- Prior self-harm or suicide attempts
- Mania symptoms
- Psychosis
- Trauma
- Substance use
- Anxiety

Stressor:
- Father's unexpected job loss 2 weeks ago
- Family must relocate to a new state

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

1. **Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode** - The patient demonstrates multiple depressive symptoms (depressed mood, anhedonia, fatigue, decreased appetite, passive suicidal ideation, concentration problems) that have been present for about 1 week. However, MDD requires symptoms for at least 2 weeks. The symptoms are causing functional impairment (school performance). The irritability could also be a manifestation of depression in adolescents.
   
2. **Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Disturbance of Emotions and Conduct** - The identifiable stressor (job loss and relocation) preceded symptom onset by a week, with both emotional and behavioral components emerging within the expected timeframe. The emotional dysregulation (sadness, irritability) combined with conduct problems (aggression, property damage, sibling bullying) fits this presentation better than full MDD given the symptom duration falls short of the 2-week threshold.

3. **Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood** - Could apply if the behavioral disturbance is considered secondary to the primary mood disturbance.

4. **Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder** - Less likely given the clear temporal relationship to the stressor and absence of severe recurrent outbursts.

5. **Oppositional Defiant Disorder** - The defiance and aggression are present but appear reactive to the stressor rather than a persistent pattern, and the acute onset argues against this as a primary diagnosis.

6. **Unspecified Depressive Disorder** - Possible if the presentation doesn't fully align with adjustment disorder criteria.

The most likely diagnosis appears to be **Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Disturbance of Emotions and Conduct**, given the clear precipitant, symptom onset within three months, and the combination of emotional and behavioral symptoms that don't yet meet criteria for a primary mood or disruptive disorder.

If symptoms persist beyond two weeks, **Major Depressive Disorder** becomes more likely. **Unspecified Depressive Disorder** could also apply given the depressive features present. The behavioral symptoms suggest **ODD** as a consideration, though they seem more reactive than primary, and an unspecified disruptive disorder classification might be appropriate if the presentation doesn't fit neatly into established categories. - behavioral disturbances (irritability, aggression) that emerged recently alongside depressive symptoms. Since the presentation spans only one week, this falls short of Major Depressive Disorder's two-week minimum, but the clear stressor and mixed emotional-behavioral response point directly to Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Disturbance of Emotions and Conduct as the primary diagnosis. Secondary considerations include Major Depressive Disorder if symptoms persist beyond the required duration, Oppositional Defiant Disorder for the conduct component, and Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, though the acute onset makes this less likely.","1.

- Prior Bipolar Disorder diagnosis that she contests
- Complex trauma history that hasn't been fully assessed
- Currently denies distress or functional impairment from past traumatic events

Denied Symptoms:
- Psychosis symptoms denied
- Manic symptoms denied (higher than usual energy or goal-directed activity)

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

1. **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)** - F42.2
The patient exhibits classic OCD symptoms across multiple domains: contamination obsessions with compulsive handwashing (25+ times daily), use of barriers to prevent contact with perceived contaminants, fear of illness, and body-focused obsessions with mirror checking and skin-picking behaviors.

She carries tweezers constantly and checks mirrors every 30 minutes, driven by not-just-right sensations about facial hair and bumps. She demonstrates fair insight by recognizing these hairs/bumps aren't always physically present, yet feels compelled to act on the intrusive thoughts or her distress escalates. The obsessions and compulsions cause marked distress and significantly impair her functioning.

2. **Hoarding Disorder** - F42.3
The patient demonstrates persistent difficulty discarding possessions with a strong perceived need to save items and emotional attachment to belongings. Her accumulation has spread across multiple locations—home, garage, basement, warehouse, and a neighbor's garage—creating significant financial strain and distress. The behavior appears unrelated to other conditions.

3. **Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent** - F33.x
She experiences anhedonia, restlessness, sleep disruption, worthlessness, and concentration difficulties, with depressive episodes occurring roughly every few months. She reports passive suicidal ideation and denies manic symptoms, ruling out bipolar disorder. The constellation of symptoms—particularly sleep disturbance, anhedonia, worthlessness, concentration impairment, and suicidal ideation—suggests moderate to severe presentation, likely F33.2 (recurrent, severe without psychotic features).

4. **Unspecified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder** or PTSD
She has a documented trauma history and prior PTSD diagnosis, but currently denies distress or functional impairment from traumatic events. Without active symptomatology, a PTSD diagnosis isn't supported; F43.9 could be considered if warranted, though deferral may be appropriate.

5. **Excoriation (Skin-Picking) Disorder** - F42.4
The ""not-just-right"" sensations regarding facial hair and skin bumps might align with this diagnosis.

However, the presentation emphasizes checking and avoidance behaviors rather than actual skin lesions from picking, which suggests this is better understood as an OCD manifestation.

Reconsidering the full picture: OCD appears to be the primary diagnosis, with contamination obsessions driving the compulsive handwashing and body-focused checking behaviors—both hallmark OCD features.

The secondary diagnoses would include Hoarding Disorder (F42.3), which is distinct from OCD in DSM-5-TR and clearly present given the accumulation, difficulty discarding, and resulting financial and spatial impairment. Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, either Moderate or Severe (F33.1 or F33.2), is also evident from the recurring depressive symptoms. The complex trauma history warrants consideration as well.

Given her previous PTSD diagnosis and trauma background, even though she doesn't report current distress, an Unspecified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder (F43.9) might be appropriate. Body Dysmorphic Disorder could apply to her concerns about facial hair and bumps, but her acknowledgment that these concerns aren't constant suggests better insight than typical BDD, making OCD the more fitting conceptualization.

The final diagnostic formulation includes Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (F42.2 with good or fair insight), Hoarding Disorder (F42.3), Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate (F33.1), and Unspecified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder (F43.9).

I'm double-checking the ICD-10 coding structure: F42 encompasses OCD, with F42.2 representing mixed obsessional thoughts and acts as the primary OCD code, and F42.3 designated for Hoarding Disorder. There's also F42.4 for excoriation disorder, which could be relevant given her skin-picking behaviors.

For the depressive disorder coding, the recurrent depressive disorder category (F33) applies here. Given she meets five or more criteria—including suicidal ideation, severely restricted sleep (4 hours), anhedonia, feelings of worthlessness, concentration difficulties, and psychomotor agitation—this presentation suggests at least moderate severity, so F33.1 would be the appropriate code. The trauma-related diagnosis would fall under F43.10 for PTSD or F43.9 if the presentation doesn't fully meet PTSD criteria.

Since she denies current distress or functional impairment from the traumatic events, a trauma-related disorder diagnosis may not be warranted, though her complex trauma history and prior PTSD diagnosis should be documented and monitored. For a potential fifth diagnosis, insomnia disorder (F51.01) could apply given the consistent 4-hour sleep pattern, though this may be secondary to the depression. Body Dysmorphic Disorder (F45.22) is worth considering given her facial concerns, though these appear more aligned with OCD-type somatic preoccupations. She previously received a bipolar diagnosis that she disputes, which complicates the diagnostic picture.

Settling on the primary five diagnoses: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (F42.2) as the primary condition, Hoarding Disorder (F42.3), Major Depressive Disorder Recurrent Moderate (F33.1), Unspecified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder (F43.9) given the unassessed complex trauma background, and Body Dysmorphic Disorder (F45.22) as a differential consideration for the facial preoccupations, recognizing potential overlap with her OCD presentation. Her HIV/AIDS status and the disputed bipolar history also warrant consideration in the overall clinical picture. The depression severity warrants closer examination. She meets criteria with anhedonia, psychomotor agitation, severe sleep restriction to 4 hours, worthlessness, concentration problems, and suicidal ideation—that's 6 symptoms meeting the threshold for MDD. The suicidal ideation lacks plan or intent, pointing toward moderate rather than severe presentation, so F33.1 fits. Regarding the prior bipolar diagnosis she contests, I should note this remains in the differential given the history, though her current presentation doesn't clearly demonstrate the mood cycling or grandiosity typical of bipolar disorder.

She explicitly denies elevated mood, increased goal-directed activity, and psychotic features across her lifetime. Without documented manic or hypomanic episodes and given the pattern of recurrent depressive episodes, major depressive disorder recurrent appears most appropriate. The previous bipolar label may have been a misdiagnosis.

The final diagnostic picture includes OCD with hoarding features, the recurrent moderate depression, trauma-related distress, and sleep disturbance that appears secondary to her psychiatric conditions rather than a primary sleep disorder.

Reconsidering the fifth diagnosis—insomnia as a standalone condition is less appropriate when it stems from her depression and anxiety. The contamination fears and illness preoccupation are already encompassed within her OCD diagnosis. Her significant social withdrawal and the complex trauma history warrant the trauma-related disorder diagnosis. Body dysmorphic disorder could be considered for her facial concerns, though these seem more consistent with her obsessive-compulsive patterns and the ""not-just-right"" sensations she describes.

Looking more closely at her facial preoccupations—the perceived hair and bumps, the distress they cause despite acknowledging they're not always physically present, the frequent mirror checking and tweezers she carries—this presentation aligns with OCD featuring sensory phenomena and exactness concerns rather than body dysmorphic disorder. Her preserved insight that these concerns aren't always grounded in reality distinguishes this from BDD, where insight is typically absent or delusional. The checking and avoidance behaviors reinforce the OCD diagnosis. So the primary diagnoses remain OCD and hoarding disorder, with the trauma-related disorder capturing her unresolved history.

For the depression, the moderate severity rating seems fitting given she meets multiple criteria, has passive suicidal ideation, and shows clear functional decline across her presentation. Though the symptom count and presence of SI could justify a severe rating, moderate appears most defensible. I should also consider whether her depression might be secondary to her medical condition—HIV/AIDS could account for some depressive symptoms—but her presentation suggests a primary mood disorder rather than one directly caused by the medical condition itself. The patient's recurrent depressive episodes occurring every few months align better with Major Depressive Disorder than with depression secondary to her HIV/AIDS diagnosis, especially given she's on antiretroviral therapy with likely viral suppression. While HIV can cause neurological effects and psychological distress, the pattern and presentation here suggest a primary mood disorder rather than a medical condition-related depression.","1.

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

1. **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)**
Clear indicators include intrusive thoughts about harming others that cause distress without acting on them, compulsive rituals involving arranging and checking performed in sets of three with ""just right"" sensations, and significant time spent on these behaviors. The condition emerged at age 18 and intensified under stress, with documented prior OCD diagnosis and functional impairment.

2. **Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD)**
Evidence spans from childhood conduct problems—truancy, deception, theft, physical aggression—continuing into adulthood at age 25. The pattern shows consistent disregard for social norms, including criminal activity and repeated incarceration, along with dishonesty through fraudulent documents. Aggressive behavior manifested in fighting with resulting head injuries, combined with reckless endangerment and absence of guilt regarding harm caused to others, including blaming a victim for a car theft. These behaviors occur outside any psychotic or mood disorder episodes.

3. **Opioid Use Disorder**
Multiple substance dependencies with primary opioid involvement necessitated medication-assisted treatment via Suboxone followed by Methadone maintenance, indicating the severity and chronicity of the addiction.

4. **Mood Disorder with Episodic Pattern**
Symptoms including loss of interest in activities, reduced appetite, low energy, and impaired focus that fluctuate cyclically over several months suggest either a persistent depressive condition with superimposed major episodes or a recurrent major depressive pattern. The cyclical waxing and waning presentation points toward Persistent Depressive Disorder with intermittent major depressive episodes, though recurrent Major Depressive Disorder remains a possibility depending on episode severity and duration.

5. **

ADHD - F90.x**
Prior ADHD diagnosis with documented trials of stimulant medications (Adderall, Concerta) and current concentration problems warrant inclusion, though concentration deficits overlap significantly with depressive symptoms. The concentration difficulties need careful assessment to determine whether they stem primarily from ADHD or mood disturbance.

**Differential Considerations:**

The obsessive thoughts about harming others differ fundamentally from violent ideation—these are unwanted, distressing intrusions that he actively resists through compulsions, not ego-syntonic fantasies. Current substance use is stabilized through medication-assisted treatment. The significant neurological history—multiple concussions and seizure disorder—raises the possibility of personality or behavioral changes secondary to traumatic brain injury or neurological sequelae.

However, the timeline suggests antisocial patterns emerged early (childhood fighting precipitated the head injuries), indicating ASPD as the primary diagnosis rather than acquired personality change from TBI.

**Top 5 Diagnoses:**

1. **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (F42.2)** with fair insight—the primary complaint with clear obsessions and neutralizing compulsions

2. **Antisocial Personality Disorder (F60.2)** with documented conduct disorder before age 15 and sustained antisocial behavior into adulthood

3. **Opioid Use Disorder on maintenance therapy (F11.20 or F11.21)** depending on current abstinence status

4. **Persistent**

Depressive Disorder (F34.1) or Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent (F33.0/F33.1)

5. **ADHD (F90.0, F90.1, or F90.2)** based on prior diagnosis and treatment response

For coding specificity: OCD uses F42.2; ASPD is F60.2; opioid maintenance ranges from F11.20 across severity levels with F11.21 for remission; dysthymia is F34.1; and ADHD codes vary by presentation type (inattentive, hyperactive-impulsive, or combined).

Since he escalated from Suboxone to Methadone, the opioid disorder likely warrants F11.20 (moderate severity in sustained remission on maintenance), though the exact coding depends on current substance use status and whether remission criteria apply given his stability on medication.

For the mood symptoms that fluctuate every few months with anhedonia, appetite loss, fatigue, and concentration problems causing mild functional impact, I'm considering whether this fits persistent depressive disorder (F34.1) if it's been present for 2+ years, or major depressive disorder with recurrent episodes (F33.x) if there are distinct periods of recovery between episodes. The presentation could align with either diagnosis depending on the temporal pattern.

My final coding selections are: OCD (F42.2), Antisocial Personality Disorder (F60.2), Opioid Use Disorder in remission (F11.21), Persistent Depressive Disorder (F34.1), and ADHD unspecified (F90.9). The chronic, fluctuating nature of the depressive symptoms with current mild severity points toward persistent depressive disorder rather than major depressive disorder with distinct episodes.","1.

**Data Extraction and Organization:**

Demographics:
- 25-year-old transgender male (assigned female at birth)
- Lives with non-supportive parents
- Works as hospital lab technician

Primary Presenting Symptoms:
1. Intrusive thoughts related to:
   - Morality (consuming animal products, viewing violent media = ""condoning"" violence)
   - Contamination (fears of transmitting sexual fluids)
   - Harm (accidentally killing insects, belief viewing violence = condoning it)
   - Scrupulosity themes

2. Compulsive behaviors:
   - Extensive reassurance seeking
   - Repeatedly checking lab results at work
   - Avoidance (video games, television)
   - Dietary restrictions
   - Handwashing

3. Panic attacks - frequent, triggered by distress from intrusive thoughts

4. Depressive symptoms:
   - ""Always a little depressed"" with recent intensification
   - Sad, empty, hopeless most days
   - Anhedonia
   - Sleep disturbances
   - Psychomotor retardation
   - Fatigue
   - Worthlessness and guilt
   - Concentration difficulties
   - Suicidal ideation (passive - ""needs to be dead,"" believes suicide would be ""the moral thing to do"" - ego-dystonic SI related to OCD)
   - No current plan or intent (5% estimated risk within 3 months)

5. Social anxiety:
   - Dates back to middle/high school
   - Was ""pretty much mute"" with few friends
   - Currently introverted with limited social connections

6. Gender identity:
   - Identifies as male throughout life
   - Currently on low-dose testosterone (concealed from family)
   - Family interfering with gender-affirming surgeries
   - Distress about symptoms interfering with gender expression

7. Functional impairment:
   - Dependent on parents for housing and support
   - Marked disruption across daily activities and self-care
   - Struggles managing basic functioning

History:
- Childhood ""delusions"" about being from a fantasy world, chosen by gods - resolved by age 18 (likely fantasy/imaginative play rather than true psychosis)
- Previous fluvoxamine use until age 24 for panic symptoms
- Symptom exacerbation upon discontinuation
- Identifies as asexual (questions if avoidance-related)

Mental Status:
- Good insight - notes thoughts are ego-dystonic (""not consistent with who he is"")

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

1. **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder**
- Presents with intrusive thoughts centered on contamination, harm, and moral concerns
- Engages in reassurance-seeking, checking behaviors, avoidance patterns, handwashing, and dietary restrictions
- Ego-dystonic with preserved insight
- Causes substantial functional decline
- Consumes significant time and energy
- Demonstrated response to SSRI therapy previously
This appears to be the PRIMARY diagnosis.

2. **Major Depressive Disorder**
- Multiple depressive symptoms present: persistent low mood, loss of interest in activities, sleep disruption, slowed movements, exhaustion, feelings of worthlessness and guilt, impaired focus, and active suicidal thoughts

The pattern of ""always a little depressed"" with recent worsening points toward a recurrent course rather than a first episode. The chronic baseline mood combined with acute intensification suggests either persistent depressive disorder with a superimposed major depressive episode, or recurrent major depression. Given the presentation, recurrent MDD appears most consistent with the clinical picture.

Beyond the mood disorder, several other conditions warrant consideration. Panic attacks occur frequently and have been previously managed with fluvoxamine, with triggers often tied to obsessive-compulsive concerns. Social anxiety has been present since adolescence, marked by selective mutism-like features and persistent social withdrawal despite current self-identification as introverted. Additionally, the patient is transgender and currently on testosterone with plans for gender-affirming procedures, experiencing distress related to how symptoms affect gender expression within a non-supportive family context.

Regarding the earlier childhood experiences of believing they were from a fantasy world—these appear to have been imaginative play rather than true psychotic symptoms, as they naturally resolved by age 18 without intervention. The suicidal ideation seems more connected to obsessive-compulsive ruminations, particularly moral-themed intrusions, than to depression alone, though depressive symptoms are certainly contributing.

The primary diagnosis is clearly obsessive-compulsive disorder given the classic presentation of intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors. Major depressive disorder with recurrent episodes at severe intensity also meets full criteria. Panic disorder and social anxiety disorder round out the clinical picture, each with distinct symptom clusters and treatment implications. For OCD, F42.2 applies since the presentation involves mixed obsessional thoughts and acts with good insight. MDD severity warrants F33.2 given the recurrent episodes, suicidal ideation, and marked functional decline. I should verify whether psychotic features are present to confirm this code versus F33.3.

The patient's statement about being ""always a little depressed"" suggests possible persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) with a superimposed major depressive episode, which would be F34.1 with F32.x. However, the primary clinical focus remains on the OCD as the dominant diagnosis, with depression potentially secondary to the obsessive-compulsive symptoms and resulting impairment. I'll prioritize OCD as the principal diagnosis while noting the comorbid mood disturbance.

For the diagnostic formulation: OCD is clearly the most prominent presentation given the extensive obsessions and compulsions described. The depressive symptoms appear both reactive to functional impairment and potentially part of a chronic baseline low mood. Panic attacks have a documented history. Social anxiety has been present since adolescence. Gender dysphoria exists but is partially managed. The pattern of ""always a little depressed"" with recent worsening points toward either recurrent MDD or persistent depressive disorder with an acute exacerbation—the distinction matters for coding but both capture the clinical reality of chronic mood dysregulation with current severity.

**Data Extraction and Organization:**

Demographics:
- 47-year-old female
- Northeastern United States
- Lives alone, no local support system
- Recently unemployed (terminated for alleged ""disorganization"" which she contests)
- Plans to relocate to Vietnam

Relevant History:
- Childhood head injury at age 11 without loss of consciousness
- Iron supplementation (good physical health otherwise)
- Denies substance use
- Reports an unspecified ""extremely traumatic event"" but denies re-experiencing symptoms
- Social withdrawal following job loss and death of pet cat

Longstanding Behavioral Patterns (since approximately age 8):
- Organizational tendencies: precise block stacking, meticulous desk organization
- Particularly pronounced during high school (when 16 people lived in her home)
- Contamination-related behaviors:
  - Using barriers when touching public surfaces
  - Frequent hand sanitization (predating pandemic)
  - Immediate cleaning of perceived contamination
- Regular cleaning throughout the day
- Cannot tolerate ""a single dirty dish in the sink""
- Immediate need to address any uncleanliness
- **Key point**: She denies these behaviors cause distress or impairment; she ""enjoys"" cleaning and maintaining organization

Current Mood Symptoms (past two weeks):
- Persistent depressed mood
- Anhedonia
- Restlessness
- Fatigue
- Feelings of worthlessness
- Symptoms are ""manageable""
- Denies suicidal ideation

Irritability and Social Functioning:
- Persistent irritability
- Social withdrawal
- Increased argumentativeness
- Characterizes herself as ""more lucid"" than others
- Doesn't ""follow the script""
- Withdrawn from social connections
- Irritation with friends' ""bad advice""

Ruled Out by Assessment:
- Panic disorder


- Social anxiety disorder
- Substance use disorders
- Psychotic disorders
- Eating disorders
- Generalized anxiety disorder

Denied Symptoms:
- Manic/hypomanic symptoms (grandiosity, decreased need for sleep, pressured speech, racing thoughts, distractibility, increased goal-directed activity)
- Re-experiencing symptoms related to trauma

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

1. **Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD) vs. OCD:**
The patient has longstanding patterns of organization, orderliness, and perfectionism dating back to childhood (age 8). Key features include:
- Preoccupation with or derliness, perfectionism, and control
- Rigidity about cleanliness
- Excessive devotion to productivity/cleaning

The critical distinction is that she denies distress from these behaviors and actively enjoys them—they're ego-syntonic rather than ego-dystonic. While contamination concerns and cleaning behaviors could suggest OCD, she doesn't experience them as intrusive or distressing. Her job termination for alleged ""disorganization"" is notable, though she disputes it; this could indicate her standards diverge from typical expectations or reflect unrecognized functional impairment. This presentation is most consistent with **Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (F60.5)**.

2. **Major Depressive Disorder:**

Over the past two weeks, she's experiencing depressed mood, anhedonia, restlessness, fatigue, and worthlessness—meeting criteria for a Major Depressive Episode. The recent stressors (job loss, pet death) are clear precipitants. She reports symptoms are ""manageable"" and denies suicidal ideation, suggesting mild severity. **Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Mild (F32.0)** fits best, though moderate severity is also possible depending on functional impact.

3. **Adjustment Disorder:**
The recent stressors and symptom onset could point to Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, but since full MDD criteria are met, MDD takes diagnostic precedence.

4. **Post

-Traumatic Stress Disorder:**
She mentions an ""extremely traumatic event"" yet denies re-experiencing symptoms. Without intrusion, avoidance, cognitive/mood changes, and arousal symptoms, PTSD criteria aren't fully met. It remains in the differential if additional information surfaces.

5. **OCD:**
The contamination concerns and cleaning rituals could suggest OCD, but she lacks intrusive, unwanted obsessions, finds the behaviors ego-syntonic, reports no distress from them, and the pattern aligns more with OCPD. OCD without good insight could still be considered differentially given the contamination focus and ritualistic quality.

6. **Personality considerations:**
She describes herself as ""more lucid"" than others and resistant to social conventions, with withdrawal from friends and irritability. This hints at narcissistic or schizoid features, though insufficient for a full personality disorder diagnosis beyond OCPD. Her sense of superiority about not following ""the script"" combined with social detachment suggests some personality-level rigidity, though the primary presentation remains consistent with obsessive-compulsive patterns rather than a distinct personality pathology.

The differential diagnosis centers on OCPD as primary—a lifelong pattern of orderliness, perfectionism, and control that's ego-syntonic and evident since childhood. Major Depressive Disorder appears secondary, with depressed mood, anhedonia, restlessness, and fatigue present over recent weeks, likely triggered by the job termination.

OCD warrants consideration given contamination fears and cleaning compulsions, but the ego-syntonic quality and absence of distress argue against it. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood could apply if MDD criteria fall short, given the clear temporal link to stressors. The acknowledged ""extremely traumatic event"" raises questions about unresolved trauma, though without re-experiencing symptoms, PTSD doesn't fit—an unspecified trauma-related disorder might be more appropriate.

Reconsidering the diagnostic hierarchy based on what's clinically most pressing: the current depressive episode is actively affecting her functioning through social withdrawal, the OCPD traits represent a longstanding pattern, and contamination obsessions with cleaning rituals are present. The mood disturbance should take priority since it's the acute symptomatic presentation. Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Moderate (F32.1) fits better than mild given multiple symptoms and functional impact, despite her saying things are ""manageable"" and denying suicidal ideation. OCPD remains the stable personality structure, OCD the contamination-focused symptom cluster, and Adjustment Disorder would only apply if depressive criteria weren't fully met.

I'm questioning whether the contamination concerns truly constitute OCD or reflect OCPD's perfectionism around cleanliness. Even with poor or absent insight, OCD can present with compulsive cleaning, but her presentation—the pervasive orderliness, devotion to cleanliness as a personal value rather than distressing intrusions—aligns more closely with the personality disorder framework.

That said, OCPD and OCD can coexist. My working diagnoses are Major Depressive Disorder (mild, single episode) as the acute concern, Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder as the longstanding characterological pattern, and OCD remains in the differential given the cleaning behaviors, though the ego-syntonic quality and lack of clear distress about the obsessions themselves suggest OCPD is the better fit.

I'm also considering Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood since there are identifiable stressors, but she endorses five depressive symptoms—depressed mood, anhedonia, fatigue, worthlessness, and psychomotor changes—which satisfies MDD criteria. The timeline of two weeks following the stressors supports MDD. There's also an acknowledged traumatic event that doesn't fully meet PTSD criteria, so an unspecified trauma-related disorder could be relevant.

Regarding diagnostic hierarchy, while OCPD is the most longstanding feature, the acute depressive episode is what's currently driving her distress and functional impairment, making MDD the appropriate primary diagnosis. The OCPD remains a significant personality pattern that warrants documentation.

Her comments about being ""more lucid"" and not following conventional paths have a somewhat grandiose or suspicious undertone, though she denies inflated self-regard and shows no psychotic features—this appears to reflect her personality style and present frustration rather than a distinct disorder. I should also consider whether schizoid traits might apply given her social withdrawal, but this seems situational rather than a lifelong pattern. Narcissistic features don't appear prominent enough to warrant a separate diagnosis.

The irritability fits well with a depressive episode, supporting the MDD diagnosis. For coding, I'm settling on F32.1 for moderate major depressive disorder, F60.5 for obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, and F42 for OCD if present, with the specific F42 subcategory depending on whether obsessions or compulsions predominate. 3.

Their psychiatric history includes diagnoses of MDD and GAD at age 15-16, PTSD in 2016 following emotional abuse by high school friends, and ADHD in 2018 (without neuropsychological evaluation). Current medications include Lisdexamfetamine 50mg (since 2018), various supplements, and a contraceptive injection.

- Currently denies PTSD symptoms

6. **Eating-Related Symptoms:**
- History of binge eating episodes
- During binges: ate rapidly, felt disgusted and embarrassed after
- Compensatory behavior: fasted for ~3 days after binges
- Frequency: <1 time per week
- Not engaged in these behaviors in past 2 months (in remission)

7. **ADHD:**
- Diagnosed in 2018 without neuropsychological evaluation
- Currently on Lisdexamfetamine 50mg

**Differential Diagnosis:**

1. **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) - F42.2**
The patient meets criteria for OCD with:
- Obsessions: intrusive visualizations, ""not just right"" feelings, distressing sexual intrusive thoughts
- Compulsions: reorganizing for up to 12 hours, checking behaviors, rewriting notes
- Time-consuming (>1 hour/day)
- Causes significant distress and functional impairment
- Onset at age 5
This appears to be the primary diagnosis given the severity and duration.

2. **Excoriation (Skin-Picking) Disorder - F42.4**
The patient demonstrates recurrent skin picking targeting ingrown hairs and areas like the neck, jaw, and cuticles, with multiple failed attempts to reduce the behavior (such as wearing pants). The compulsive picking causes marked distress and occupies more than an hour daily. This body-focused repetitive behavior disorder frequently co-occurs with OCD.

3. **Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent - F33.x**
Current presentation includes passive suicidal ideation, anhedonia, appetite loss, sleep disturbance, psychomotor agitation, worthlessness, and concentration difficulties. The history of multiple suicide attempts indicates recurrent episodes, with current severity appearing moderate (F33.1) to moderate-severe.

4. **Social Anxiety Disorder - F40.10**
Persistent apprehension about social judgment and rejection drives avoidance and distressing preoccupation with social interactions. The patient engages in excessive reassurance-seeking and reports significant relationship impairment. ADHD diagnosis from 2018 lacks neuropsychological testing, and some cognitive symptoms may reflect depression or OCD rather than attention deficit. An eating disorder history involving binge-fast cycles suggests possible Bulimia Nervosa if binges occurred weekly, though current frequency requires clarification to determine if the condition is in remission or active.

Trauma history includes emotional and sexual abuse with prior PTSD diagnosis, though current symptoms are denied. Generalized anxiety previously diagnosed but may be subsumed within social anxiety or OCD presentations. The primary clinical picture centers on OCD as the most severe and functionally limiting condition, with secondary diagnoses including skin-picking disorder and social anxiety contributing to overall distress.

Major depression with recurrent episodes and past suicide attempts warrants inclusion, alongside ADHD which was previously diagnosed and treated but may need reassessment. Eating disorder behaviors appear dormant and fell short of full diagnostic thresholds—likely OSFED rather than bulimia nervosa. Cannabis use appears primarily motivated by anxiety management rather than constituting a separate use disorder at this time.

The core diagnoses are OCD, excoriation disorder, major depression, social anxiety, and ADHD. Depression severity seems moderate given the constellation of symptoms—passive ideation, anhedonia, appetite and sleep disturbance, agitation, guilt, and concentration difficulties—though the patient denies any intent toward self-harm.

For ADHD, without a comprehensive evaluation or clarity on presentation subtype, unspecified type is the most defensible coding. The OCD symptoms may also be contributing to apparent attention difficulties, making it harder to distinguish the primary ADHD presentation.","1. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder - F42.2

1021,"The patient is an 18-year-old non-binary college freshman with a complex psychiatric presentation. They report a history of childhood anxiety, perfectionism, and ritualistic self-punishment behaviors starting in the third grade. Currently, their most debilitating symptom is anxiety about ""contaminated air"" when others cough or sneeze, prompting them to cover their face and hold their breath even when the trigger is far away or on television. They engage in checking and counting behaviors based on the number 3, including checking mirrors while driving, locking/unlocking their car, and tapping their toothbrush. These compulsions are experienced as uncontrollable, with the patient reporting they sometimes modify behaviors (like holding an imaginary door handle in their pocket) when the original compulsion would be disruptive. At approximately age 16, the patient developed anorexia nervosa, restricting their food intake and ultimately requiring intervention from parents and a treatment team. Despite gaining weight under external pressure, the patient continues to restrict eating, has a distinct fear of gaining weight, becoming fat, fasting until dinner, drinking coffee to intentionally upset their stomach. Their BMI currently falls within the normal range. Around the same time their eating disorder developed, the patient experienced depressive symptoms including hopelessness, low motivation, and self-harm behaviors (pulling hair, cutting, punching stomach). They had suicidal ideation during high school, including thoughts of jumping in front of a train and fantasizing about wandering into hallways during a school shooting.

- Actively resisting treatment engagement, viewing recovery as incompatible with their eating disorder goals

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

1. **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (F42.2)**
Clear OCD presentation with contamination obsessions triggered by others' respiratory symptoms and corresponding compulsions including avoidance, breath-holding, checking rituals, and counting behaviors tied to the number 3.  These intrusive patterns began in childhood and now significantly impair functioning, which the patient identifies as their primary concern.

2. **Anorexia Nervosa, Restricting Type, in Partial Remission (F50.01 or F50.02)**
Despite achieving normal BMI following intervention at age 16, the patient maintains restrictive eating patterns (fasting until evening, using coffee as an appetite suppressant) and persistent weight/shape preoccupation. The belief that ""getting better means getting fat"" reflects ongoing cognitive distortions characteristic of the disorder, indicating incomplete recovery rather than full remission.

3. **Major Depressive Disorder, in Partial Remission (F32.4 or F33.41)**
Earlier depressive symptoms—including hopelessness, anhedonia, self-harm, and suicidal ideation—emerged around age 16 but have since improved, though the patient continues to experience residual mood symptoms that don't meet full criteria for an active episode.

4. **Nonsuicidal Self-Injury** - While not yet a formal DSM-5 diagnosis, the self-injurious behaviors (hair pulling, cutting, punching) warrant clinical attention given their frequency and the patient's 50% estimated risk of self-harm over the next three months.

5. **Tric hotillomania (Hair-Pulling Disorder) - F63.3** - The hair pulling appears driven by emotional distress and self-punishment rather than the classic presentation of trichotillomania, so it may be better understood as part of the broader self-harm pattern.

6. **Generalized Anxiety Disorder** - There's evidence of longstanding anxiety from childhood, though the current clinical picture aligns more closely with OCD.

The most salient feature across the presentation is the anxiety centered on ""contaminated air,"" which points to OCD as the primary diagnosis. Reconsidering the full clinical picture and prioritizing by symptom severity and functional impairment, OCD emerges as the core condition requiring treatment focus.

The differential diagnosis includes Anorexia Nervosa in partial remission given the persistent restrictive eating patterns despite normalized weight, a history of Major Depressive Disorder that appears to be in partial remission with subsyndromal features, and ongoing anxiety symptoms that could reflect either generalized anxiety or be secondary to the OCD. The self-injurious behaviors—hair pulling and skin-related concerns—warrant consideration as either manifestations of the anxiety disorder or as separate impulse control issues, though the clinical presentation suggests they're primarily driven by the obsessive-compulsive symptoms and emotional dysregulation. Looking at the diagnostic codes, F42.2 covers mixed obsessional thoughts and acts, which fits the contamination obsessions paired with checking and counting compulsions. Hair-pulling could indicate trichotillomania (F63.3) if it's the primary concern, but here it appears secondary to the self-harm impulses rather than a distinct body-focused repetitive behavior. The OCD diagnosis with mixed presentation seems most appropriate as the primary condition given the prominent obsessive-compulsive features driving much of the clinical picture.

Beyond the OCD, there's the eating disorder component—anorexia nervosa in partial remission (F50.01) captures the persistent weight gain fears and restrictive behaviors despite normalized BMI, meeting the criteria for partial remission where the intense preoccupation with weight persists even though full diagnostic criteria aren't currently met. The mood disturbance warrants consideration too: major depressive disorder in partial remission (F32.4) accounts for the prior depressive episode with suicidal ideation that's now subsyndromal but still present. Generalized anxiety disorder (F41.1) also merits evaluation given the pervasive worry and anxiety symptoms throughout the presentation.

For a fifth diagnosis, the self-harm behaviors—cutting, hair pulling, punching stomach—with a 50% estimated risk of self-harm in the next three months suggest considering trichotillomania (F63.3) if the hair pulling warrants separate coding, or possibly unspecified anxiety disorder (F41.9) to capture the childhood anxiety history and perfectionism that extend beyond OCD-specific symptoms. There's also the question of whether emerging personality disorder traits are present, though at 18 years old this is borderline for formal diagnosis; the emotional dysregulation, identity concerns, and resistance to treatment could suggest early manifestations, but this would require careful longitudinal assessment rather than immediate coding. . Anorexia Nervosa, Restricting Type, In Partial Remission - F50.01
3. Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, In Partial Remission - F32.4
4. Generalized Anxiety Disorder - F41.1

Having both GAD and an unspecified anxiety disorder creates redundancy, so I need to reconsider the fifth diagnosis. Trichotillomania could fit given the self-harm pattern, though social anxiety and trauma-related disorders aren't sufficiently supported by the clinical picture. The ritualistic self-punishment behaviors dating back to third grade and persistent self-harm suggest I should focus on conditions directly evidenced by the presentation rather than adding overlapping anxiety diagnoses.

For the final diagnostic list, I'm considering Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder as primary given the ritualistic nature of the behaviors, with Anorexia Nervosa in partial remission since BMI is normalized but cognitive and behavioral symptoms persist. The mood and anxiety components would be captured through Major Depressive Disorder and GAD. However, the self-harm itself might warrant its own diagnostic consideration—Nonsuicidal Self-Injury Disorder appears in the DSM-5-TR and could be more specific than adding redundant anxiety diagnoses. ressive Disorder, Single Episode, In Partial Remission - F32.4
4. Generalized Anxiety Disorder - F41.1
5. Unspecified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder - F43.9

The core diagnoses are OCD with clear obsessions and compulsions, anorexia nervosa with persistent features despite normalized weight, and major depressive disorder showing partial improvement. For additional diagnoses, I'm weighing the early-onset anxiety symptoms and the ongoing self-harm behaviors that persist as a clinical concern even within the depressive framework. settle on the final diagnoses. OCD with both obsessions and compulsions maps to F42.2, anorexia nervosa restricting type is F50.01, major depressive disorder in partial remission is F32.4, and generalized anxiety disorder is F41.1. For the fifth diagnosis, other specified anxiety disorder at F41.8 better captures the residual anxiety symptoms not fully accounted for by the primary anxiety diagnoses. Disorder - F41.1

Looking back at the diagnostic criteria, I'm questioning whether GAD is sufficiently supported. The case mentions childhood anxiety and current worry about contamination, but the contamination concerns are already captured by the OCD diagnosis. GAD specifically requires excessive worry across multiple domains with difficulty controlling it and associated symptoms—the vignette doesn't clearly establish this pattern beyond what's explained by OCD. The childhood anxiety is mentioned but not detailed enough to confirm it met GAD criteria.

I should consider F41.9 (Unspecified Anxiety Disorder) instead for the earlier anxiety presentation that isn't fully characterized, and potentially F32.89 (Other Specified Depressive Disorder) for the brief depressive episodes lasting a few hours rather than the full major depressive episode duration.

My final list: OCD as primary, anorexia nervosa restricting type, major depressive disorder in partial remission, unspecified anxiety disorder for the childhood presentation, and other specified depressive disorder for the recurrent brief episodes with self-harm ideation. This captures the complexity without overreaching diagnostically where evidence is limited.

One more thing to consider—whether anorexia nervosa should be coded in partial remission. The patient's BMI is now normal, but she continues restricting food intake, fasting until dinner, and using coffee to suppress appetite. Since she still meets criteria B and C despite weight restoration, partial remission would be appropriate here.

The ICD-10 code F50.01 doesn't include a modifier for remission status like DSM-5-TR does, so the code stays the same. For the final diagnoses: OCD gets F42.2, anorexia nervosa restricting type is F50.01, major depression in partial remission is F32.4, generalized anxiety is F41.1, and I need to reconsider the fifth diagnosis given her ongoing self-harm risk.

The brief depressive episodes occurring every couple of weeks could represent either residual symptoms from the partially remitted MDD or warrant a separate diagnosis of Other Specified Depressive Disorder (F32.89) if they're distinct enough. This category captures presentations like recurrent brief depression or episodes with insufficient symptoms that still cause meaningful distress. Since her depressive symptoms appear episodic rather than continuous, I should evaluate whether they're better conceptualized as part of the existing MDD diagnosis or as a separate condition warranting its own code.

For the fifth diagnosis, I'm considering whether to include Unspecified Anxiety Disorder to account for residual anxiety symptoms not fully captured by the OCD diagnosis, or Trichotillomania if the hair-pulling represents a distinct behavioral disorder rather than just self-harm in the context of her other conditions. Given the clinical picture, my final diagnostic formulation would be: OCD, Anorexia Nervosa (Restricting Type), Major Depressive Disorder (Single Episode, In Partial Remission), Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Unspecified Anxiety Disorder to address the remaining anxiety features that don't fit neatly into the other diagnoses.

Wait—listing both GAD and Unspecified Anxiety Disorder creates redundancy. I need to choose between them for the fourth diagnosis and find a more clinically distinct fifth option. Trichotillomania could work if the hair-pulling is a separate compulsive behavior, or I could consider Other Specified Depressive Disorder if there are depressive features not fully captured by the current MDD diagnosis. Social Anxiety Disorder and Specific Phobia don't seem clearly indicated since her contamination fears are better explained within the OCD framework.

My final list: OCD, Anorexia Nervosa (Restricting Type), Major Depressive Disorder (Single Episode, In Partial Remission), Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Trichotillomania to account for the hair-pulling behavior as a distinct compulsive disorder. Disorder, Single Episode, In Partial Remission - F32.4
4. Generalized Anxiety Disorder - F41.1
5. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder - F41.8

This formulation addresses the core OCD presentation alongside the eating disorder, captures the depressive history now partially resolved, and accounts for both the longstanding perfectionism-driven anxiety and any remaining anxiety features that don't fit neatly into the generalized anxiety diagnosis.","1.

She recently transitioned from working as a childcare specialist to self-employment as a freelancer. Her medical history includes anemia and IBS, for which she takes daily iron supplements. The patient previously attempted treatment with Zoloft (10mg) for OCD symptoms but discontinued due to emotional blunting effects. She reports consuming alcohol 1-2 glasses a few times monthly and using marijuana daily when available, which she finds helpful for intrusive thoughts despite occasionally triggering anxiety. The patient's most distressing symptoms involve intrusive thoughts about sexually harming children, accompanied by physiological responses that she describes as ""groinal"". These thoughts were particularly distressing during her work as a childcare specialist, where she engaged in compulsive staring at children's genital areas to ""prove"" she wasn't sexually attracted to them and sometimes avoided changing diapers due to fear of sexual arousal. After experiencing an intrusive dream about sexually harming her brother in January 2021, she experienced physical symptoms (shaking, freezing) when interacting with him and subsequently increased their time together as a form of reassurance. Additionally, the patient reports significant health anxiety focused on getting cancer, HIV, and STIs, leading to excessive symptom research. The patient experiences panic attacks (1-2 times monthly) lasting 15-30 minutes when triggered by intrusive thoughts, with symptoms including shortness of breath, crying, sweating, racing heart, chest pain, and feelings of detachment. She reports seeking reassurance from her mother when these thoughts become overwhelming. The patient also endorses distressing and functionally impairing social anxiety in small groups, leading to significant avoidance; however, she stated that this anxiety is primary due to her unwanted/intrusive thoughts rather than a fear of being judged.

- Marijuana: daily when available - uses for intrusive thoughts but sometimes triggers anxiety

**Core Presenting Symptoms:**

1. OCD Symptoms (Primary Presentation):
- Intrusive thoughts about sexually harming children (obsessions)
- ""Groinal"" physiological responses (misinterpreted arousal sensations - common in Pure O/sexual obsessions)
- Compulsive behaviors:
  - Staring at children's genital areas to ""prove"" she wasn't attracted (checking compulsion)
  - Avoidance of changing diapers (avoidance compulsion)
  - Increased time with brother after intrusive dream (reassurance-seeking compulsion)
  - Seeking reassurance from mother
- Intrusive dream about sexually harming brother (January 2021)
- Physical symptoms when interacting with brother (shaking, freezing)

2. Health Anxiety:
- Fears of cancer, HIV, STIs
- Excessive symptom research (compulsive behavior)

3. Panic Symptoms:
- Frequency: 1-2 times monthly
- Duration: 15-30 minutes
- Triggers: intrusive thoughts
- Symptoms: shortness of breath, crying, sweating, racing heart, chest pain, feelings of detachment
   
4. Social Anxiety:
- Distressing in small groups with significant avoidance, though she attributes this to intrusive thoughts rather than social fear itself, creating functional impairment

5. Depressive Episodes:
- Reports over 50 episodes in the past year, each lasting at least two weeks with decreased appetite, sleep disturbance, fatigue, guilt, concentration difficulties, and thoughts of death—described as challenging but not completely debilitating

**Differential Diagnosis Analysis:**

1. **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (F42.2)** - PRIMARY
This is clearly the primary diagnosis. The patient exhibits classic features of sexual obsessions (POCD subtype) with ego-dystonic intrusive thoughts about sexually harming children, groinal responses commonly misinterpreted in sexual obsessions, checking compulsions like staring at genital areas, avoidance compulsions during diaper changes, and reassurance-seeking behaviors with her brother and mother. She demonstrates significant distress and functional impairment with good insight recognizing these as unwanted intrusions.

2. **Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent (F33.x)**
The patient reports multiple depressive episodes, though the stated frequency of over 50 episodes in the past year each lasting two weeks presents a mathematical inconsistency given there are only 52 weeks available.

This likely represents persistent depressive symptoms with fluctuations rather than discrete episodes. Her symptoms include decreased appetite, sleep disturbance, fatigue, guilt, and concentration difficulties with thoughts of death, suggesting F33.1 (moderate) given her description of symptoms as ""challenging but not completely debilitating."" The frequency claim suggests she may be overestimating or having difficulty quantifying episodes, or these could represent mood fluctuations consistent with Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) with intermittent major episodes rather than separate MDD episodes.

3. **Panic Disorder (F41.0)**
She experiences recurrent panic attacks occurring one to two times monthly with classic symptoms like shortness of breath, sweating, racing heart, chest pain, and depersonalization lasting 15-30 minutes. However, these appear triggered by intrusive thoughts, making them expected panic attacks within her OCD context rather than true panic disorder.

4. **Illness Anxiety Disorder (F45.21)** vs. OCD with health-related obsessions
Her fears about cancer, HIV, and STIs coupled with excessive symptom research and checking behaviors could be better understood as part of her OCD presentation involving contamination and health obsessions rather than a separate diagnosis.

5. **Social Anxiety Disorder (F40.10)**
She reports social anxiety in small groups with significant avoidance, though she attributes this to intrusive thoughts,

not fear of judgment. The DSM-5 criteria for SAD specifically require fear of negative evaluation, so her avoidance pattern may actually reflect OCD-driven behavior rather than social anxiety disorder.

6. **Cannabis Use**
Daily use when available serves as symptom management for intrusive thoughts, though it sometimes worsens anxiety. This pattern warrants consideration of Cannabis Use Disorder if continued use despite anxiety escalation meets diagnostic criteria.

**Final Diagnostic Formulation:**

1. **OCD (F42.2)** - Primary diagnosis
Clear obsessions including sexual intrusive thoughts and health fears with corresponding compulsions like checking, reassurance-seeking, and avoidance. The symptoms are ego-dystonic, distressing, and functionally impairing, representing the core pathology.

2. **Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate (F33.1)**
Multiple depressive episodes with neurovegetative symptoms present.

3. **Panic Disorder (F41.0)**
Recurrent panic attacks with characteristic symptoms, though triggered in nature, suggesting a panic disorder pattern. These could also be understood as panic attacks occurring within the OCD context.

4. **Cannabis Use Disorder (F12.10)** - Mild
Daily use when available with continued use despite anxiety exacerbation meets at least two criteria.

5. **Illness Anxiety Disorder (F45.21)** or Generalized Anxiety Disorder as additional consideration

Reconsidering the diagnostic hierarchy: social anxiety appears secondary to OCD obsessions rather than judgment fears, health anxiety may stem from OCD-related health obsessions with checking compulsions, and panic attacks fit within the broader OCD presentation.

The most parsimonious formulation positions OCD as the primary condition with comorbid depression. OCD drives the panic attacks through intrusive thoughts, making the final diagnostic ranking: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder as primary, Major Depressive Disorder Recurrent Moderate as secondary, followed by Panic Disorder, Cannabis Use Disorder Mild, and Illness Anxiety Disorder—though this last could be reconceptualized as part of the OCD presentation. For depression severity, the patient's description of ""challenging but not completely debilitating"" combined with death thoughts but no active suicidal ideation supports a moderate rating. Cannabis Use Disorder, Mild - F12.10 fits given the daily use when available, larger amounts than intended, and continued use despite worsening anxiety. Illness Anxiety Disorder - F45.21 is included for differential purposes, though the health preoccupation appears better explained as an OCD obsession.

Social Anxiety Disorder doesn't apply here since the social anxiety stems from intrusive thoughts rather than fear of judgment, making it secondary to the OCD presentation. Similarly, Generalized Anxiety Disorder lacks sufficient evidence—while anxiety was diagnosed in 2019, the current clinical picture is dominated by OCD, panic symptoms, and health-focused anxiety rather than generalized worry across multiple domains.","1.

1023,"Erik is a 10-year-old male who recently completed 4th grade in a gifted math program. He lives with his biological parents and seven-year-old brother, with whom he has ""constant"" conflict including arguing, screaming, and hitting. Erik has a developmental history of severe temper tantrums prior to age 4, with behavioral challenges emerging in kindergarten and worsening in subsequent grades. His mother reports that her son engages in ""constant defiance"", experiences rapid mood changes, and demonstrates impulsive behavior, including occasional incidents of pulling knives (though never pointing them at anyone). Daily arguments at home frequently escalate to physical aggression, particularly with his mother and brother. Erik has expressed statements such as ""I wish I could go to sleep and never wake up"" and reports feeling depressed ""randomly"" a couple times per month since second or third grade, though he denies daily depressive symptoms or changes in sleep or appetite. Erik's behavioral difficulties have manifested in both home and school environments. In school, he has engaged in speaking out of turn, refusing to follow directions, agitating teachers, and having ""screaming matches"" with staff. Despite these challenges, Erik maintains high grades across subjects (with math being his most difficult class at a B), has several friends, and is described as a leader in social interactions. He has a Section 504 plan that allows for movement opportunities and frequent breaks when needed. In March 2019, Erik began taking 2mg of Guanfacine (extended release) for attention/concentration deficits, which has helped reduce impulsivity and improve behavioral control, though aggressive and defiant behaviors have continued. His mother reports implementing a point system for rewards and consequences but notes limited effectiveness due to inconsistent expectations between parents. Formal assessment indicates that Erik demonstrates a pattern of emotional dysregulation, defiance, and aggressive behavior, with physical aggression occurring approximately every other day at home. Assessment also confirms prior symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, which are present across settings and contribute to emotional dysregulation and academic underperformance relative to ability.","Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Moderate (F91.3); Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Combined Type (F90.2)",,brian_zaboski,,,,"Let me carefully analyze this clinical case vignette to develop an accurate differential diagnosis.

**Data Extraction and Organization:**

Demographics:
- 10-year-old male
- Completed 4th grade in gifted math program
- Lives with biological parents and 7-year-old brother

Developmental History:
- Severe temper tantrums prior to age 4
- Behavioral challenges emerging in kindergarten, worsening in subsequent grades
- Onset of depressive feelings reported since 2nd or 3rd grade (intermittent)

Current Symptoms and Behaviors:

1. Mood/Emotional Symptoms:
- ""Constant"" conflict with brother (arguing, screaming, hitting)
- Rapid mood changes
- Emotional dysregulation
- Reports feeling depressed ""randomly"" a couple times per month
- Has expressed passive suicidal ideation (""I wish I could go to sleep and never wake up"")
- Denies daily depressive symptoms
- No changes in sleep or appetite reported

2. Behavioral Symptoms:
- ""Constant defiance""
- Impulsive behavior (including pulling knives, though never pointing at anyone)
- Daily arguments escalating to physical aggression (particularly with mother and brother)
- Physical aggression approximately every other day at home
- In school: speaking out of turn, refusing to follow directions, agitating teachers, ""screaming matches"" with staff
- Aggressive and defiant behaviors continue despite medication

3. ADHD-related Symptoms:
- Inattention
- Hyperactivity
- Impulsivity
- Present across settings
- Contributing to emotional dysregulation and academic underperformance relative to ability
- Currently on Guanfacine 2mg ER (started March 2019) - has helped reduce impulsivity and improve behavioral control

4. Functional Impact:
- Has Section 504 plan (movement opportunities, frequent breaks)
- Academic underperformance relative to ability (gifted but B in math, his most difficult class)


- Despite behavioral difficulties, maintains solid academic performance overall and has developed friendships, functioning as a social leader among peers

5. Family/Environmental Factors:
- Inconsistent parental expectations
- Point system implemented but limited effectiveness

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

1. **Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)**
- Clearly documented symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity
- Present across settings (home and school)
- Contributing to functional impairment
- Onset before age 12
- Currently being treated with Guanfacine with partial response
- This appears well-established based on formal assessment

2. **Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD)** - The persistent pattern of defiance, argumentativeness, and aggression toward authority figures and peers, particularly the mother and brother, combined with the early-onset temper tantrums and current daily conflicts, suggests ODD as a comorbid condition. The defiance appears pervasive across settings and is not solely attributable to ADHD.

3. **Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD)** - I need to carefully evaluate whether DMDD better explains the severe outbursts. The child shows frequent explosive episodes with physical aggression occurring every other day, an underlying irritable mood, and symptom onset before age 10, all fitting the diagnostic criteria. The key distinction is whether the aggression and defiance are primarily mood-driven versus oppositional in nature. suggest more intermittent irritability rather than the persistent irritability required for DMDD.

IED is another consideration given the frequent aggressive outbursts, but it's less likely applicable here since it can't be diagnosed before age 6 and requires at least 3 months of established pattern. Additionally, IED shouldn't be diagnosed when ADHD or ODD better explain the presentation. His depressive symptoms appear sporadic—he reports feeling down a couple times monthly and has passive suicidal ideation, but denies persistent low mood, sleep disturbance, or appetite changes, making a depressive disorder diagnosis less fitting.

Regarding bipolar disorder, while he mentions rapid mood shifts, there's no evidence of distinct manic or hypomanic episodes with elevated mood, decreased sleep need, or grandiosity. The mood fluctuations seem more aligned with the emotional dysregulation typical of ADHD and ODD. The core question becomes whether ODD with depressive features better accounts for his presentation than DMDD, particularly since his irritability appears episodic rather than the constant baseline required for DMDD, while his oppositional and defiant behaviors are described as ongoing. age 10, which falls within the required onset window.

The critical distinction hinges on whether persistent irritability exists between episodes. While not explicitly detailed, the constant defiance and daily arguments suggest an underlying chronic irritability rather than purely episodic mood disturbance.

Since DMDD and ODD are mutually exclusive diagnoses, I need to determine which better captures the clinical picture. The prominent emotional dysregulation with severe outbursts, combined with the early onset and pervasive irritability, points more toward DMDD. The intermittent depressive symptoms and passive suicidal ideation also warrant consideration of an additional depressive disorder diagnosis.

**Primary diagnostic impressions:**

ADHD, Combined presentation remains the foundational diagnosis with clear evidence across settings and documented medication response. ODD shows strong support through the defiant, argumentative behaviors across multiple contexts. DMDD warrants consideration as an alternative given the recurrent severe outbursts and apparent mood dysregulation, though the documentation of baseline irritability between episodes could be more explicit.

For mood-related concerns, intermittent depressive symptoms and passive suicidal ideation suggest an unspecified depressive disorder rather than meeting full major depressive disorder criteria. Conduct disorder seems less likely given the absence of serious rule violations or deceitful behavior. The clinical picture appears more consistent with oppositional patterns than conduct-level severity, and while adjustment disorder or anxiety-related conditions could theoretically apply, the chronic course and symptom pattern don't align well with those diagnoses.

Regarding the diagnostic hierarchy, ADHD is clearly established through formal assessment, but the behavioral dysregulation and mood instability present as the primary clinical concern. However, there's a critical constraint: DSM-5 doesn't permit concurrent diagnosis of both ODD and DMDD. Given the prominent temper outbursts and mood dysregulation alongside the oppositional behaviors, DMDD may be the more appropriate choice for the second diagnosis, with ADHD remaining primary. This would be followed by unspecified depressive disorder for the intermittent depressive symptoms. .2) - core presentation with inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity across settings. ODD (F91.3) fits the persistent defiance and anger, though I need to rule out whether CD criteria are actually met since that would preclude an ODD diagnosis. DMDD seems less likely given the lack of persistent irritability between episodes. Unspecified Depressive Disorder (F32.A) could account for mood symptoms, and Conduct Disorder, childhood-onset (F91.1) warrants consideration given the aggression severity, though the pattern seems more reactive than the broader rule violations and deceitfulness typical of CD. Since ODD and CD are mutually exclusive per DSM-5, I'm treating these as differential considerations to systematically evaluate rather than concurrent diagnoses. 81 ✓
- Unspecified Depressive Disorder: F32.A ✓
- Conduct Disorder, childhood-onset: F91.1 ✓

All codes check out. I should consider whether early-onset bipolar disorder fits, given the rapid mood shifts mentioned. However, there's no evidence of manic or hypomanic features—no decreased sleep need, grandiosity, or pressured speech. The mood fluctuations appear reactive and tied to poor emotional regulation rather than true mood cycling. DSM-5 guidance also warns against overdiagnosing bipolar in children, so I'll maintain my current differential.

His symptoms have included paranoid ideation, auditory and visual hallucinations, delusions (such as believing television was sending special messages), obsessive thoughts, compulsive behaviors, and periods of mania and depression. Dole holds a master’s degree in computer science and previously developed cybersecurity systems but resigned in 2019 due to unmanageable anxiety. He currently lives with his parents, who provide significant assistance with daily activities. Throughout his treatment history, Dole has demonstrated paranoid thoughts beginning at age 19, with recurrent episodes of acute psychosis requiring hospitalization. In 2018, he experienced hallucinations of messages on his phone, and in 2019, he reported seeing ""the devil"" and experiencing auditory hallucinations. He endorses unwanted/intrusive thoughts causing anxiety, which he attempts to neutralize with repetitive behaviors that take 1-3 hours daily. His symptoms include fear of harming himself, violent imagery, concerns about germs, and moral preoccupations.

- Delusions or hallucinations for at least two weeks in the absence of major mood episodes
- Functioning has decreased notably compared to pre-symptom baseline

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

1. **Schizophrenia (F20.9)**
The intake impressions directly align with core diagnostic criteria—he presents with multiple psychotic features including delusions, hallucinations, and negative symptoms persisting beyond the two-week threshold without prominent mood disturbance. His family history of psychosis and the progressive course from age 17 support this diagnosis. The note clarifies that delusions or hallucinations persisted for at least two weeks without concurrent major mood episodes, which distinguishes this from schizoaffective disorder. The significant family history of paternal psychosis further supports the schizophrenia diagnosis.

OCD is also present as a separate condition. He experiences intrusive obsessions—fears of harming himself, violent imagery, contamination concerns, and moral preoccupations—that trigger anxiety, which he manages through repetitive compulsions taking 1-3 hours daily. These ego-dystonic thoughts and neutralizing behaviors cause marked distress and functional decline, meeting OCD criteria with poor insight. This appears comorbid with rather than secondary to the psychotic disorder.

Autism Spectrum Disorder was previously diagnosed as Asperger's Syndrome. While early developmental history would help confirm this, the documented diagnosis and current social and functional challenges align with this presentation. Bipolar I Disorder is less likely given the psychotic symptoms persist independent of mood episodes.

Narcissistic Personality Disorder was noted in prior assessments but lacks sufficient current evidence. The primary diagnosis remains Schizophrenia, supported by the presence of Criterion A symptoms, functional deterioration over six months, and critically, psychotic manifestations occurring outside of mood episodes. OCD with poor insight also warrants consideration given the prominent obsessive-compulsive features.

The obsessions around harm, violence, and contamination paired with compulsive neutralizing behaviors consuming 1-3 hours daily suggest significant OCD pathology that coexists with the psychotic disorder. Autism Spectrum Disorder from earlier diagnosis should be revisited with developmental history. Anxiety symptoms appear secondary to the primary psychotic and obsessive-compulsive presentations. Schizoaffective Disorder remains possible given the mood episode history, though current clinical features align more closely with schizophrenia.

Regarding the OCD specifically, the patient demonstrates limited insight into these symptoms. Using ICD-10 coding, F42.2 captures the mixed obsessional thoughts and acts pattern, though F42.9 could apply if the presentation doesn't fit neatly into the subtypes. The top diagnoses to prioritize are schizophrenia (F20.9), OCD with the appropriate F42 code, and autism spectrum disorder (F84.0).

Schizoaffective disorder (F25.9) remains on the differential given the history of mood episodes, but the independence of psychotic symptoms from mood disturbances points more toward primary schizophrenia. Anxiety symptoms warrant coding as well, whether generalized anxiety (F41.1) or unspecified anxiety (F41.9). The cognitive deficits observed could represent schizophrenia's neurocognitive impact rather than a separate entity, though this distinction matters for treatment planning.","1. Schizophrenia - F20.9

1025,"Patient is a 32-year-old Black American male with no prior diagnostic history who presents with a chief complaint of ""uncontrollable staring, particularly at breasts/genitals"". The patient reports that this behavior began at age 27 (late 2017) and involves involuntary staring at people he does not know well, with particular focus on the genitals/breasts of all genders and ages, including children.

**Diagnostic Formulation:**

**Primary Consideration: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) - F42.2**

The presentation strongly suggests OCD. The staring behavior appears to be an intrusive, unwanted urge he cannot suppress through willpower alone, meeting the 6 hours/day time threshold. The ego-dystonic sexual thoughts about orientation and the distress around viewing children's genitals fit common OCD themes. Significant functional deterioration across employment, social, and relationship domains supports the severity criterion.

The staring likely functions as a compulsion—either checking to assess his own responses or attempting to neutralize obsessive fears about being a pedophile. The guilt, shame, and secrecy surrounding these thoughts are hallmark features of sexual obsessions in OCD.

**Secondary Considerations:**

1. **Unspecified Depressive Disorder (F32.A) or Other Specified Depressive Disorder (F32.89)**
- Depressive symptoms are clinically significant but fall short of full MDD criteria
- Suicidal ideation, feelings of worthlessness, guilt, and irritability are present
- This may be secondary to the OCD or represent a comorbid condition

2. **Social Anxiety Disorder (F40.10)**
- Positive screening, but the anxiety appears rooted in fear of judgment specifically about the staring behavior
- Could be better understood as part of the OCD presentation rather than a distinct disorder
- Would only warrant separate diagnosis if social anxiety has extended beyond this specific concern

3. **Agoraphobia (F40.00)**
- Also endorsed on screening but directly tied to avoidance related to staring fears
- Likely secondary to the OCD

4. **Panic Disorder (F41.0)**
- Panic attacks are present but situationally triggered by thoughts about staring or unemployment concerns
- This pattern suggests situational anxiety tied to OCD rather than panic disorder proper
- Unlikely to be the primary diagnosis

5. **Voyeuristic Disorder**
- Need to rule this out given the staring at intimate body areas
- Key distinction: voyeuristic disorder involves sexual pleasure from the behavior, whereas here the staring is unwanted and causes distress
- No evidence of sexual gratification, making OCD a better fit

6. **Pedophilic Disorder (F65.4)**
- Staring includes children, but no sexual arousal to children is evident
- The intrusive thoughts are clearly unwanted and distressing
- This presentation aligns more with pedophilia-themed OCD than actual pedophilic disorder

7. **Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder (F42.8)**
- Warrants consideration depending on whether the presentation fully satisfies OCD criteria, though the clinical picture does appear to meet the full diagnostic threshold

The primary diagnosis is Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, which satisfies DSM-5-TR criteria through intrusive thoughts about staring and sexual orientation concerns, compulsive staring behaviors or rituals to manage anxiety, significant time investment of 6 hours daily, and marked functional impairment. Depressive symptoms appear present but don't fully constitute major depressive disorder, suggesting either Other Specified or Unspecified Depressive Disorder as a secondary diagnosis. Social Anxiety Disorder may also be present, though it could be secondary to the OCD itself. For depressive symptoms that don't reach the threshold for major depressive disorder but are still clinically significant, Other Specified Depressive Disorder (F32.89) fits better than the unspecified category, since we can identify the reason—insufficient symptom count. Social anxiety and agoraphobia might warrant separate diagnoses despite appearing secondary to the OCD, given that they're producing measurable impairment. Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood could apply, though the timeline seems too extended for that diagnosis.

The primary diagnoses would be OCD (F42.2), along with Other Specified Depressive Disorder (F32.89), Social Anxiety Disorder (F40.10), and Agoraphobia (F40.00). Panic Disorder doesn't fit since the panic attacks are situationally bound rather than unexpected, which is a core requirement. Suicidal ideation wouldn't receive its own F-code diagnosis.

I should rule out other possibilities—tic disorders, autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, and psychotic disorders all lack supporting evidence. The patient demonstrates clear insight into the problematic nature of their behaviors, which argues against psychosis. OCD with comorbid depressive and anxiety features provides the most coherent explanation. Body Dysmorphic Disorder is also worth considering given the potential focus on appearance-related concerns.

Sexual obsessions represent a recognized OCD subtype, particularly intrusive thoughts about sexual orientation or inappropriate sexual content—presentations that align precisely with what's being described. The diagnostic code F42.2 accurately captures OCD in the current classification system.","1. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder - F42.2

1026,"A 32-year-old male with a past medical history of polysubstance use disorder (cocaine, marijuana, and methamphetamine) presents for bizarre behavior brought in by emergency medical services (EMS) after a neighbor called to report that patient was outside her home threatening her with a knife. Per neighbor's report, the patient had been yelling about the FBI and demanding to be let into her home while waving a knife. Patient was yelling at paramedics enroute and attempted to punch a paramedic when being loaded into the ambulance. Upon arrival to the emergency room, patient was agitated, requiring emergency intermuscular injection of medications to deescalate. Patient told doctors in the emergency room that he felt unsafe and needed them to watch his knives for him. He felt like the government was going to come get him and use the weapons in his home against him. He recalls going to the neighbor's home in an attempt to have her hide his knives for him. A few hours later, the psychiatry team came to evaluate the patient, at which point the patient appeared drowsy and asked to be left alone due to feeling tired. He refused to provide urine sample but allowed a blood draw. His blood work returned with elevated white blood count (WBC) at 18 x10e3/uL. He denied having any prior psychiatric diagnoses but admitted that he has been using methamphetamine recently. He recalls he had been admitted to an inpatient psychiatry service before, around 1 year prior after using meth, where he stayed for 3 days and was discharged on Seroquel, which patient denied currently taking. He does not recall his diagnosis from that admission. Patient agreed to receive further care at a psychiatric facility and was voluntarily transferred to an inpatient psychiatry unit. Patient was started again on Seroquel but refused to take it during admission. He was seen napping during the day and reported some stomach cramping to the treatment team.

Key Clinical Information:

Demographics:
- 32-year-old male

Past Medical/Psychiatric History:
- Polysubstance use disorder (cocaine, marijuana, methamphetamine)
- Prior psychiatric admission ~1 year ago after meth use (3 days, discharged on Seroquel)
- No formal psychiatric diagnosis recalled by patient

Presenting Problem:
- Bizarre behavior - threatening neighbor with knife
- Yelling about FBI
- Paranoid ideation about government coming to get him
- Agitation requiring emergency IM medications
- Violence/aggression (attempted to punch paramedic)

Timeline:
- Recent methamphetamine use admitted
- Symptoms resolved by day 3 of admission

Mental Status Observations:
- Initially agitated
- Paranoid delusions (FBI, government conspiracy)
- Later drowsy (post-medication)
- By day 3, feeling well

Physical/Lab Findings:
- Elevated WBC (18 x10e3/uL) - could indicate stress response, infection, or stimulant use
- Refused urine drug screen
- Stomach cramping
- Daytime napping

Course:
- Rapid resolution of symptoms (3 days)
- Signed self out feeling well

Clinical Analysis:

1. The presentation strongly suggests methamphetamine-induced psychotic disorder:
- Clear temporal relationship with meth use
- Paranoid delusions typical of stimulant psychosis
- Prior similar episode after meth use
- Rapid resolution (consistent with substance-induced rather than primary psychotic disorder)
- Elevated WBC can be associated with stimulant use

2. Stimulant Use Disorder (Methamphetamine):
- History of polysubstance use
- Admitted recent methamphetamine use
- Repeated admissions related to meth use
- Continued use despite negative consequences

3. Differential considerations:
- Schizophrenia spectrum disorder - less likely given rapid resolution and clear substance relationship


- Brief psychotic disorder seems less fitting given the direct link to substance use
- Cocaine and cannabis use also present but methamphetamine appears primary driver

DSM-5-TR Diagnoses:

Primary: Methamphetamine-Induced Psychotic Disorder, With Delusions
- F15.259 (Amphetamine or other stimulant use disorder, moderate or severe, with stimulant-induced psychotic disorder)
- F15.959 if use disorder severity cannot be determined

Secondary: Stimulant Use Disorder, Methamphetamine type - F15.20 (moderate) or F15.10 depending on severity assessment

. The coding for substance-induced psychotic disorder hinges on whether a concurrent use disorder exists. Given the patient's polysubstance history and recent methamphetamine use, a moderate-to-severe use disorder appears likely, supporting the F15.259 code. Cannabis Use Disorder - F12.10/F12.20 and Cocaine Use Disorder - F14.10/F14.20 should also be documented as secondary diagnoses.

I should consider whether an underlying primary psychotic disorder like unspecified schizophrenia spectrum (F29) might be present, though the presentation aligns with substance-induced psychosis. Amphetamine intoxication (F15.129) could be an additional consideration depending on timing and symptom onset. d psychotic disorder, with delusions - F15.259. The F15.259 code already captures the severity of stimulant use, so I don't need to list it separately.

For the other substances, I'm noting cannabis use disorder at F12.20 and cocaine use disorder at F14.20. I should also consider F29 to rule out an underlying schizophrenia spectrum disorder, and potentially F23 for brief psychotic disorder as an alternative diagnosis. The key question is whether to emphasize the stimulant use disorder separately or let it be implied by the induced psychotic disorder code—I think the latter approach is cleaner since the F15.259 already indicates severe use. F29 as a rule-out given the rapid resolution and clear temporal relationship to methamphetamine use. The cocaine and cannabis use disorders should be coded based on the documented history—cocaine appears moderate severity, and cannabis moderate as well given the polysubstance pattern. The primary diagnosis remains the substance-induced psychotic disorder with delusions, which best explains the paranoid ideation and its quick resolution following cessation of use. izophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder - F29, with brief psychotic disorder as an alternative consideration. The substance-induced psychotic disorder diagnosis captures both the psychotic symptoms and the underlying methamphetamine use disorder, making it the primary diagnosis, while the other substance use disorders and primary psychotic rule-outs follow in the differential.","1.

**Key Clinical Information Extracted:**

Demographics:
- 16-year-old male, 9th grade
- No known past psychiatric history

Presenting concerns (per mother):
- Decreased communication with mother
- Decreased energy
- Odd behavior - accusing neighbors of spying on him and talking poorly about him (paranoid ideation/possible persecutory delusions)
- Feeling unsafe because people are trying to harm him (paranoid ideation)
- Increased irritability with behavioral manifestations (punching walls)

Mental Status/Direct Interview:
- Constricted and dysphoric affect
- Hair covering eyes (possible avoidance, social withdrawal)
- Soft speech
- Reports anger related to ruminating about biological father's abuse of mother (past trauma exposure)

Reported Symptoms:
- Poor memory
- Poor concentration
- Anxiety
- Rumination
- Thoughts of death (several months ago) - passive suicidal ideation
- Access to guns
- Non-suicidal self-injury (cutting wrist few months ago to cope with feelings)
- Poor sleep
- Low mood
- Paranoia (new-onset)
- Visual disturbances - ""mind playing tricks on him, morphing objects into faces"" - possible visual illusions or hallucinations

Substance Use:
- Long-time ""bars"" (Xanax/alprazolam) user - unknown dosage, evasive about frequency/recent use
- Marijuana use - recently increased specifically to help with paranoia
- Positive urine cannabinoid screen

Lab work: No other abnormalities

Treatment Response:
- Improved after one week on fluoxetine and aripiprazole
- Better mood
- No longer feeling paranoid

**Differential Diagnosis Consideration:**

1. **Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder** - The patient has been using cannabis (confirmed by urine screen) and benzodiazepines (Xanax). Cannabis use is strongly associated with psychotic symptoms, particularly in adolescents. 

The timeline suggests paranoia emerged first, then he escalated marijuana use to manage it, though he was already a chronic user. The visual disturbances and paranoid features could stem from substance use, but the sequence indicates the psychotic symptoms may have preceded the increased cannabis consumption. He meets criteria for both cannabis and benzodiazepine use disorders given his evasiveness about amounts, continued use despite psychological consequences, and positive screening.

4. **Major Depressive Disorder with psych otic features** - He has low mood, poor sleep, poor concentration, anhedonia (decreased energy/less engaged), irritability, thoughts of death. The psychotic symptoms (paranoia) could be mood-congruent psychotic features of depression. However, the perceptual disturbances (morphing objects into faces) are less typical of psychotic depression.

5. **Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder** - Given age of onset, paranoid ideation, possible perceptual disturbances. However, duration is unclear and substance use complicates this.

6. **Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome** - This is a condition for further study in DSM-5, characterized by attenuated delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech that are present in attenuated form with intact reality testing but are of sufficient severity or frequency to warrant clinical attention. His symptoms could fit here if they're milder versions of full psychotic features.

The trauma history—witnessing parental violence—aligns with PTSD criteria including sleep problems and anger, though I lack clear evidence of re-experiencing and avoidance patterns. Major depressive disorder remains a strong contender given the constellation of mood, sleep, concentration, and suicidal ideation. He also engages in non-suicidal self-injury as a coping mechanism. His response to fluoxetine and aripiprazole will be informative for narrowing the differential.

The substance use pattern and evasiveness about marijuana consumption, combined with new-onset paranoid thinking he attempted to manage through cannabis, suggests both a primary mood disturbance and possible psychotic features. The visual disturbances—perceiving objects as faces—alongside depressive symptoms and positive medication response point toward major depressive disorder with psychotic features as the leading diagnosis. Cannabis use disorder also warrants consideration given the pattern of use and potential contribution to symptom emergence. with prominent depressive symptoms and his response to treatment. Cannabis Use Disorder appears confirmed given his acknowledged use and evasive behavior suggesting problematic patterns. Benzodiazepine dependence is clear from his long-standing Xanax use. The psychotic features—paranoid beliefs about neighbors surveilling him, fears of harm, and visual disturbances with object morphing—are substantial enough that I should consider whether they're primarily mood-related or represent a separate psychotic disorder. If these symptoms persist beyond the mood episode or seem disproportionate to his depression, Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder becomes more relevant as a diagnosis.

The rapid response to fluoxetine and aripiprazole within a week, combined with his prominent depressive presentation and first psychotic episode at age 16, suggests Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features as the primary diagnosis. However, the substance use and early age of onset mean I should remain open to whether this could represent Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder or an emerging primary psychotic condition like early-onset schizophreniform disorder.

For coding purposes, F32.3 (Severe depressive episode with psychotic symptoms) captures the mood disorder with psychotic features, while F12.20 would code the cannabis use disorder separately. The distinction matters clinically—if the psychotic symptoms resolve with mood treatment alone, it supports the mood disorder diagnosis; if they persist independent of mood symptoms, it points toward a primary psychotic disorder. or Anxiolytic Use Disorder, Moderate - F13.20**
   - Long-term Xanax use indicates dependence rather than abuse

4. **Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder - F29**
   - Cannot fully rule out an emerging primary psychotic disorder given his age

5. **Posttraumatic Stress Disorder - F43.10**
   - Witnessed domestic violence in childhood, persistent rumination about the trauma, disrupted sleep, and heightened irritability

I should reconsider the timeline here. He describes the paranoia as new-onset and attempted to manage it through increased cannabis use, which suggests the paranoia may have emerged independently or before the depressive episode—potentially indicating a primary psychotic condition or substance-induced psychosis rather than mood-congruent features. Additionally, PTSD requires that the person directly experience or witness the traumatic event, which he did with the domestic violence exposure.

The trauma exposure criterion appears met through witnessing paternal abuse of his mother, though I lack sufficient detail about intrusive recollections, avoidance behaviors, negative thought patterns, and physiological hyperarousal to fully establish PTSD. An adjustment disorder with mixed features could partially explain his presentation but doesn't adequately account for the psychotic symptoms.

Considering diagnostic parsimony alongside clinical complexity, the most defensible formulation includes Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features as the primary diagnosis, alongside the two substance use disorders and an unspecified psychotic disorder to capture diagnostic uncertainty about whether a primary psychotic illness is emerging.

For the fifth diagnosis, his anxiety symptoms appear intertwined with trauma-related rumination rather than representing independent generalized anxiety. PTSD remains a viable consideration given his trauma history and current sleep disturbance, irritability, and intrusive thoughts about past events, though the clinical picture doesn't cleanly fit all diagnostic criteria.

Now reconsidering the primary psychotic diagnosis—the substance use timeline is significant. Both cannabis and sedatives preceded the onset of paranoia and psychotic symptoms, suggesting a substance-induced etiology might be more accurate than an unspecified psychotic disorder. The cannabis-induced psychotic disorder code (F12.959) or sedative-induced variant (F13.959) could better capture the clinical presentation if the psychosis emerged during active intoxication or heavy use periods.

The treatment response to fluoxetine and aripiprazole doesn't definitively distinguish between substance-induced and primary psychotic disorder, since antipsychotics and antidepressants would address symptoms either way, and hospitalization with substance cessation would naturally improve outcomes in both scenarios. Taking a more conservative approach to avoid overdiagnosis when substances plausibly explain the psychotic features, the formulation should prioritize the mood disorder (clear depressive symptoms), the substance use disorders (documented problematic use), and substance-induced psychotic disorder rather than assuming a primary psychotic condition.

Alternatively, if the psychotic symptoms appear integral to a severe depressive episode rather than purely substance-driven, the diagnostic picture shifts to emphasize major depressive disorder with psychotic features as the primary diagnosis, with substance use disorders and anxiety as secondary considerations. The clinical weight of the depressive presentation and the robust antidepressant response suggest this latter framework may be more accurate. The sedative use disorder should be coded as moderate (F13.20) given the long-term use pattern suggests dependence. For the psychotic symptoms, I'm reconsidering whether cannabis-induced psychotic disorder is more appropriate than the unspecified schizophrenia spectrum diagnosis. The timeline is important here—he escalated marijuana use specifically to manage emerging paranoia, which indicates the paranoid symptoms likely preceded the increased cannabis use. While he has a positive urine screen and prior marijuana history, the sequence suggests the psychosis isn't simply cannabis-induced. Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder with onset during intoxication would be F12.959, but given the clinical picture, the mood-congruent psychotic features within the depressive episode seem more central to the presentation. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder - F41.9

The NSSI doesn't warrant a separate diagnosis since it falls under conditions for further study in DSM-5. Regarding trauma history—witnessing domestic violence and rumination about paternal abuse—I lack sufficient detail for a PTSD diagnosis, though an other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder (F43.8) could apply. The visual disturbances where objects morph into faces warrant closer examination to determine if they're psychotic features or something else entirely. The psychotic symptoms could stem from the depression itself, making a separate psychotic disorder diagnosis redundant. However, given his age and the first appearance of these symptoms, I should consider whether an emerging primary psychotic disorder might be present alongside the mood disorder. Cannabis-induced psychosis is also a possibility worth noting in the differential. Keeping F29 acknowledges this diagnostic uncertainty rather than prematurely attributing all psychosis to the depressive episode alone. original formulation with F29 included. This approach captures the mood disorder with psychotic features as the primary diagnosis, acknowledges both substance use disorders, and includes the unspecified psychotic disorder code to flag that a primary schizophrenia spectrum condition needs to be ruled out through longitudinal observation. The anxiety symptoms round out the clinical picture.","1. Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe with psychotic features - F32.3

He describes an intense feeling of anxiety if he cannot clean things before they enter his room. He states that he spends a lot of time washing his hands because if he misses a spot or brushes his hand against the side of the sink, he needs to start over to ensure that they are fully clean.

He does mention that he has been struggling in school due to having less time to study with his cleaning obligations.",Obsessive-compulsive disorder (F42),,ashley_huang,Obsessive-compulsive disorder,Obsessive-compulsive disorder (F42),,"Let me analyze this clinical case vignette carefully.

**Data Extraction and Organization:**

Demographics:
- 14-year-old male
- History of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)

Presenting Problem:
- Mother brought patient after seeing him wipe his skin with Clorox wipes
- Concern about potential chemical irritation

Timeline:
- Onset: Since COVID started in 2020 (approximately 3 years ago)
- Initial trigger: Fear of catching COVID
- Course: Progressive intensification over 3 years

Behavioral Symptoms:
1. Cleaning behaviors:
   - Wiping down devices after any outing
   - Daily wiping of doorknobs, light switches, bathroom counters
   - Using Clorox disinfecting wipes on his own body
   
2. Hand washing:
   - Washing hands more often
   - If misses a spot or touches sink side, must start over
   
3. Showering:
   - Sometimes showering multiple times a day
   - Needs to start over if feels he missed spots

Cognitive Symptoms:
- Intense fear of contamination with germs
- Views outside as ""dirty"" and his room as ""clean""
- Feels intense urge to decontaminate anything entering his room
- Believes whole room will become contaminated if items aren't cleaned

Emotional Symptoms:
- Intense anxiety if unable to clean things before they enter his room

Functional Impairment:
- Struggling in school due to less time to study
- Describes cleaning as ""obligations""

Key Features:
- Obsessions: Contamination fears (fear of germs, things being dirty)
- Compulsions: Cleaning, hand washing, showering (with ritualistic ""starting over"" behavior)
- Ego-dystonic nature implied (describes them as obligations, experiences distress)
- Time-consuming (affecting school performance)
- Pre-existing anxiety disorder (GAD)

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**


The clinical presentation fits OCD criteria. He has clear obsessions centered on contamination fears—intrusive thoughts about germs that he recognizes as excessive. His compulsions (repetitive cleaning, hand washing, showering with ritualistic patterns) are performed to neutralize these obsessions. The behaviors consume significant time, interfere with school, and cause him distress, meeting threshold for functional impairment. His pre-existing GAD may have predisposed him to developing OCD, with the pandemic serving as a trigger that intensified his anxiety into obsessive-compulsive patterns.

For differential consideration: while GAD is already documented and likely comorbid, the specific contamination-focused obsessions with ritualistic compulsions distinguish OCD as the primary concern. A specific phobia of contamination could be entertained, but phobias lack the compulsive behavioral component that defines his presentation—he's not simply avoiding germs, he's engaging in repetitive neutralizing rituals.

Illness anxiety disorder might seem relevant given his initial COVID fears, but his preoccupation has broadened to contamination generally rather than remaining illness-focused. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is unlikely at age 14, and his distress about the rituals indicates ego-dystonic symptoms characteristic of OCD rather than the ego-syntonic acceptance seen in OCPD.

The clinical picture most clearly aligns with OCD as the primary diagnosis, with GAD as a comorbid condition. .22)** - Less likely given the symptom progression beyond the initial stressor timeframe and the persistence of compulsive behaviors that better fit OCD criteria.

Reconsidering the differential, OCD remains the primary diagnosis with GAD as a documented comorbidity. The contamination fear and avoidance behaviors could suggest a specific phobia component, and illness anxiety disorder warrants consideration given the preoccupation with germs causing sickness. However, the ritualistic nature of the cleaning compulsions and the ""starting over"" pattern most directly align with OCD rather than these other conditions.

For the F-code, F42.2 (mixed obsessional thoughts and acts) appears most appropriate since the presentation includes both intrusive contamination thoughts and the corresponding compulsive cleaning rituals. The final diagnostic hierarchy places OCD as primary, followed by GAD as a pre-existing condition. Compulsive Disorder - F42.2. The differential diagnosis should also include Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1), which could explain the persistent worry and tension. Illness Anxiety Disorder (F45.21) is relevant given the health-related concerns, while Specific Phobia, Other Type (F40.298) might apply if anxiety centers on particular triggers.

- No mania screen positive
- No history of developmental delays (speech, social, learning)
- Denies: insomnia, appetite changes, concentration/memory issues, anhedonia

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

**Primary Consideration: Borderline Personality Disorder (F60.3)**

The clinical presentation strongly suggests BPD. His overdose appears motivated by fear of abandonment—when his girlfriend mentioned potentially leaving, he impulsively took pills to demonstrate his emotional pain rather than with clear intent to die. He shows a pervasive pattern of unstable relationships where people consistently leave him, alongside idealization and devaluation of both his girlfriend and mental health providers. His identity remains unclear to him, questioning whether he has bipolar disorder or autism. The combination of self-harm through cutting, impulsive overdose, and recurrent suicidal behavior fits the criterion for self-injurious acts.

His mood fluctuates significantly, particularly in response to relationship stress, and he describes persistent feelings of emptiness and worthlessness. This constellation of features—abandonment fears, relationship instability, identity disturbance, impulsivity, self-harm, affective reactivity, and chronic emptiness—meets the threshold for BPD diagnosis.

**Differential Diagnoses:**

Major Depressive Disorder appears less likely despite his reported depression. His depressive symptoms appear reactive to interpersonal conflict rather than constituting a persistent episode. He denies the neurovegetative symptoms typically associated with depression: no insomnia, appetite changes, concentration difficulties, or anhedonia. His mood reactivity aligns more closely with BPD's affective instability than with primary mood disorder pathology.

Generalized Anxiety Disorder is on the differential given his anxiety history and current escitalopram use, though current anxiety symptoms remain unclear. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood could explain the acute reaction to his girlfriend's comment, but the chronic symptom pattern points toward BPD as the primary condition. Bipolar disorder has been ruled out based on negative mania screening, and autism spectrum disorder is ruled out given no developmental history.

The primary diagnosis is Borderline Personality Disorder, supported by the full constellation of abandonment fears, unstable relationships, identity disturbance, impulsive behaviors including self-harm, affective instability, and chronic emptiness. specified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9)** - There's a documented history of anxiety and current escitalopram use, though details are insufficient to pinpoint a more specific anxiety diagnosis. I should also consider whether Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1) fits if the anxiety presentation is persistent, or Persistent Depressive Disorder (F34.1) if there's evidence of chronic low-grade depression. Adjustment disorders with depressed or mixed mood could also be relevant depending on whether symptoms are tied to identifiable stressors.

For the secondary diagnoses, the most defensible F-codes given the available information would be Unspecified Depressive Disorder (F32.9) acknowledging the stated depression history, Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9) for the anxiety with escitalopram use, and potentially Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood (F43.21) if the current presentation represents an acute worsening. Borderline Personality Disorder (F60.3) remains the primary diagnosis, with these mood and anxiety conditions as secondary presentations. 9 captures the historical depression diagnosis without assuming current full criteria are met. The anxiety symptoms warrant F41.9 given the escitalopram use. F43.21 addresses the acute stressor triggering the presentation. F34.1 reflects the chronic depressive pattern evident in his interpersonal difficulties.","1. Borderline Personality Disorder - F60.3

1030,"Patient is a 31-year-old female denying any psychiatric history who was transferred to the county psychiatry hospital from a local emergency room for threatening to kill herself. She tells the evaluating psychiatrist that she had gotten into an argument with her husband. She states that she and her husband has been living in a hotel for the past week due to a conflict between her and her mother-in-law. She reports that she feels her husband does not understand nor respect her because he was requesting to return home to be closer to his workplace. She states that she was surprised at the argument because he is usually a “good man.” When asked what made her feel disrespected this time, she replied it was because he was refusing her request to continue staying at the hotel and that he usually never says no to her. When asked her reason for staying, she stated that she just “did not feel ready” to return home yet because being around her mother-in-law stressed her out. She did not understand why her husband was not accommodating her discomfort. However, when pointing out husband’s discomfort with the long commute time to work, she minimized his concern and did not acknowledge his struggle, instead redirecting the conversation to her own feelings. When asked about the reason for her disagreement with her mother-in-law, she states it is because her mother-in-law does not recognize her efforts for contributing to the household. She states that, “My mother-in-law always complains that I don’t do chores and don’t work. But she doesn’t get it that I’m the one supporting my husband at his job and that he should be the main breadwinner anyways as the husband. Besides, I did the dishes today, it’s not even true that I don’t do chores.” When addressing the physicians, she addresses them casually (e.g. “dude,” “man,” etc.) and states to them, “You’re a doctor, you should be smart enough to understand me.” She denies that she has any mental issues that requires her to remain in the hospital, stating that, “Smart people like us, we get misunderstood, you get it right? That’s why they sent me here.” She also alludes to believing that her mother-in-law called the police to have her brought here to get her away from her husband because she’s “jealous I get to spend more time with her son than she does.” When informing her that the reason for her hospitalization was the threat of suicide, she casually waves it off, stating, “Oh, I don’t actually want to kill myself, I just said that to get my husband to listen to me.”",Narcissistic personality disorder (F60.81),,ashley_huang,Narcissistic personality disorder,Narcissistic personality disorder (F60.81),"Patient demonstrates an expectation to be recognized as superior (like with her mother-in-law), feeling that they are special and can only be understood by smart people like doctors, exploitative behaviors of expecting her husband to go along with her every demand and attempting to manipulate him via suicidal threats when he does not comply, a lack of empathy towards her husband, and believing that her mother-in-law is envious of her. These traits are key features for narcissistic personality disorder.","Let me analyze this clinical case vignette carefully to extract relevant information and develop a diagnostic formulation.

**Data Extraction and Organization:**

Demographics:
- 31-year-old female
- Denies any psychiatric history
- Married, living with husband and mother-in-law

Presenting Problem:
- Transferred from ER for threatening to kill herself
- Later admits the suicidal threat was manipulative - ""I just said that to get my husband to listen to me""

Precipitating Events:
- Argument with husband about returning home from hotel
- Ongoing conflict with mother-in-law
- Living in hotel for past week due to conflict

Key Clinical Features:

1. Interpersonal patterns:
- Conflict with mother-in-law over perceived lack of recognition
- Conflict with husband when he doesn't accommodate her
- Feels ""disrespected"" when husband says no to her
- Reports husband ""usually never says no to her""
- Unable to acknowledge husband's perspective (long commute)
- Minimizes others' concerns, redirects to her own feelings

2. Self-perception:
- Grandiose self-view - considers herself ""smart""
- Attempts to align with doctors as ""smart people like us""
- Sense of entitlement - expects others to accommodate her
- Believes she deserves special treatment
- Justifies minimal household contribution

3. Lack of empathy:
- Unable to recognize husband's discomfort with commute
- Dismisses his concerns
- Self-centered perspective

4. Need for admiration/recognition:
- Upset that mother-in-law doesn't ""recognize her efforts""
- Feels undervalued despite minimal contribution

5. Manipulative behavior:
- Used suicidal threat to get husband to listen
- Casual dismissal of the threat's seriousness
- Attempts to manipulate doctors with flattery

6. Paranoid ideation:
- Believes mother-in-law called police to separate her from husband out of ""jealousy""


- Lacks appropriate professional boundaries with clinicians, using informal language and attempting to form coalitions against family members. Demonstrates expectation that husband should be sole provider and always comply with her requests without reciprocal effort. Explicitly denies psychiatric illness and rejects hospitalization despite presenting crisis.

**Differential Diagnosis:**

1. **Narcissistic Personality Disorder (F60.81)**
Strong candidate. Evidence includes:
- Grandiose sense of self-importance (""smart people like us"")
- Sense of entitlement (

expects husband to always accommodate her)
- Lack of empathy (cannot acknowledge husband's perspective)
- Need for admiration (upset MIL doesn't recognize her efforts)
- Interpersonal exploitation (using suicidal threats manipulatively)
- Arrogant behaviors (casual address to doctors, expectation of special understanding)

2. **Histrionic Personality Disorder (F60.4)**
Some features present:
- Dramatic behavior (suicidal threat for attention)
- Suggestibility
- Discomfort when not center of attention
However, less evidence for this than NPD

3. **Borderline Personality Disorder (F60.3)**
Some features:
- Manipulative suicidal threats
- Interpersonal instability
- However, lacks: unstable self-image, chronic emptiness, splitting, intense abandonment fears, emotional dysregulation, imp ulsivity in multiple areas

4. **Unspecified Personality Disorder (F60.9)**
If criteria don't fully fit one specific type

5. **Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Disturbance of Emotions and Conduct (F43.25)**
- Stressor identified (conflict with MIL, marital conflict)
- However, the pattern seems more characterological than reactive

6. **Adult antisocial behavior (not a mental disorder)**
- Manipulative behavior
- However, this is more Z-code territory

7. **Partner Relational Problem (Z63.0)** - not F-code, excluded

8. **Other Specified Personality Disorder (F60.89)**
If features are present but don't meet full criteria for one disorder

The core presentation centers on grandiosity, entitlement, and lack of empathy—features most consistent with narcissistic pathology. While some histrionic and borderline traits appear, they're secondary to the narcissistic framework.

The paranoid ideation about the MIL's conspiracy likely reflects narcissistic injury rather than a primary paranoid disorder. Regarding secondary diagnoses: no clear mood disturbance, no psychotic features beyond characterological defensiveness, and the relational conflict appears chronic rather than adjustment-reactive.

**Primary diagnosis: Narcissistic Personality Disorder (F60.81)** best captures the constellation of grandiosity, entitlement, and interpersonal exploitation that defines this presentation.

**Secondary considerations include Borderline Personality Disorder (F60.3)** given the manipulative suicidal threats and unstable relationships, though less central to the clinical picture. Histrionic Personality Disorder (F60.4) shares overlapping dramatic and attention-seeking features. The suicidal threat warrants attention—it's manipulative rather than genuinely intent-driven, which doesn't fit factitious disorder or malingering, since she acknowledges the manipulation openly. Mixed personality features might warrant F60.89 if the presentation doesn't cleanly fit NPD alone, and Adjustment Disorder (F43.20) could apply if the stressor were primary, though the characterological patterns clearly predominate.

The differential narrows to NPD as primary, with BPD and Histrionic as secondary considerations. Unspecified personality disorder diagnoses should only be used if specific criteria aren't met, so listing it alongside more specific diagnoses would be redundant. The final diagnostic hierarchy prioritizes NPD (F60.81) first, followed by BPD (F60.3) and Histrionic (F60.4) as comorbid possibilities, with Adjustment Disorder as a potential additional stressor-related component if warranted by the clinical context.","1.

**Data Extraction and Organization:**

Demographics:
- 6-year-old patient
- Male (referred to as ""he"")
- First psychiatric evaluation

Presenting Problem:
- Referred by school
- Started kindergarten 5 months ago

Behavioral Symptoms (reported by teachers):
- Disruptive in class
- Being loud
- Getting up when not supposed to
- Frequently interrupting teachers and classmates

Home Behaviors (reported by mom):
- Likes active things: playing tag, riding bike, learning soccer
- These seem like normal activities for a 6-year-old

Observed in Clinic:
- Gets up frequently to look at things
- Playing with hand sanitizer dispenser
- Tries to get mom's attention when psychiatrist is speaking with her

Social Functioning:
- Good number of friends
- Doesn't struggle socially

Psychiatric History:
- No prior psychiatric diagnoses

Family History:
- Parents don't think anyone in family has any problems

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

The primary consideration here is **Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)**. The symptoms described align with the hyperactive-impulsive presentation:

DSM-5-TR Criteria for ADHD Hyperactive-Impulsive Presentation:
- Often fidgets/squirms or leaves seat when expected to remain seated ✓ (gets up when not supposed to, gets up frequently in clinic)
- Often runs about or climbs in situations where inappropriate (active play preferences - though this is age-appropriate)
- Often unable to play quietly
- Often ""on the go"" or acts as if ""driven by a motor""
- Often talks excessively ✓ (being loud)
- Often blurts out answers before questions completed ✓ (interrupting)
- Often has difficulty waiting turn
- Often interrupts or intrudes on others ✓ (frequently interrupting teachers and classmates)


- The symptoms appear across multiple settings—school and clinic observations—and have persisted for at least 5 months since kindergarten started, meeting the duration and cross-situational requirements. However, I should consider that he's only 6 years old and recently transitioned to kindergarten, so some behavioral adjustment is developmentally expected. His intact social relationships and lack of inattention symptoms also complicate the picture.

**Differential Diagnosis:**

1. **ADHD, Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Presentation (F**

90.1)** - The most likely diagnosis given the clear hyperactivity and impulsivity observed across settings.

2. **ADHD, Combined Presentation (F90.2)** - Could apply if inattention is present but wasn't explicitly documented.

3. **ADHD, Predominantly Inattentive Presentation (F90.0)** - Less probable since hyperactive-impulsive features dominate the clinical picture.

4. **Adjustment Disorder with disturbance of conduct (F43.24)** - While kindergarten entry is a stressor, the behaviors appear consistent across contexts rather than specifically reactive to that transition.

5. **Oppositional Defiant Disorder (F91.3)** - The presentation leans more toward hyperactivity and impulsivity than the defiant or hostile patterns characteristic of ODD.

ODD would typically involve angry mood, argumentativeness, or vindictiveness—none of which are documented here. Other considerations include Autism Spectrum Disorder, which seems unlikely given adequate social relationships and no reported repetitive behaviors or restricted interests. Anxiety could cause restlessness but lacks supporting symptoms. Normal development is ruled out by the severity prompting school intervention. The differential narrows to ADHD presentations as the primary diagnostic consideration.

ADHD in the hyperactive-impulsive form stands out as most likely—the restlessness, difficulty waiting turns, and interrupting appear across settings with age-appropriate onset and clear functional impact. Combined presentation warrants consideration if inattention proves significant upon closer evaluation. An adjustment reaction tied to kindergarten transition is possible but the symptom pattern aligns more closely with ADHD. ODD remains lower in the ranking since the defining features of defiance and hostility aren't evident. - F90.0 - ADHD, predominantly inattentive type
- F90.1 - ADHD, predominantly hyperactive type
- F90.2 - ADHD, combined type
- F90.8 - ADHD, other type
- F90.9 - ADHD, unspecified type

- F43.24 - Adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct
- F91.3 - Oppositional defiant disorder

My top five diagnoses in order of likelihood are: ADHD with predominantly hyperactive-impulsive features (F90.1), ADHD with combined presentation (F90.2), unspecified ADHD (F90.9), adjustment disorder involving conduct disturbance (F43.24), and oppositional defiant disorder (F91.3).","1.

Her outbursts are against both authority figures and peers which makes diagnosis DMDD rather than ODD.,"Let me analyze this clinical case vignette carefully to arrive at the most appropriate diagnoses.

**Data Extraction and Organization:**

Demographics:
- 10-year-old female
- Ward of the state (both parents found unfit)
- 5th grade
- Currently with a guardian
- History of multiple foster/adoptive family placements that failed

Presenting Problem:
- Brought to psychiatric hospital walk-in for hitting kids at school
- Slapped a classmate during an argument

Behavioral History:
- Many reports this year for tantrums and fights
- History of being returned from foster/adoptive families due to anger and aggression
- Easily irritable
- Little to no accountability for actions
- Blames others (""other kids annoying her"" or ""I didn't mean it"")
- Aggressive outbursts occur multiple times a week
- Reports that other kids, staff, and teachers ""annoy her"" but can't specify examples
- Denies hitting teachers/staff (only hits peers)

Mental Status Observations During Evaluation:
- Repeatedly interrupts guardian and evaluator
- Defensive (""I didn't do anything"")
- Begs to go home/avoid hospitalization
- Called guardian a ""liar"" - visibly upset
- When told aggression is reason for admission, becomes very angry and throws tissue box at glass divider
- Immediately becomes tearful and apologetic after outburst
- Denies/minimizes behavior (""I didn't do anything, I didn't mean it, I didn't even hit you"")

Context of Outbursts:
- Most common when she doesn't get her way
- Also seems irritable in general

Significant History:
- Early life trauma/instability (parents deemed unfit, ward of state)
- Multiple placement disruptions
- Chronic pattern of aggression and anger issues

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

1. **Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) - F34.81**
Key criteria met:


- Recurrent severe temper outbursts involving both verbal aggression and physical aggression (throwing objects, hitting peers)
- Intensity and duration far exceed what would be expected for the situation
- Behavior is developmentally inappropriate
- Outbursts happen at least 3 times weekly based on her report
- Baseline mood is persistently irritable and angry even between episodes, as noted by her guardian
- Symptoms manifest across multiple environments including school, home, and clinical settings
- Age falls within the 6-18 year range with presumed onset before age 10 given the chronic nature
- Longitudinal pattern suggests duration exceeding 12 months

2. **Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) - F91**

The presentation aligns with several ODD criteria: she demonstrates an angry and irritable temperament with frequent outbursts, shows defiant and argumentative behavior (interrupting, calling her guardian a liar), and consistently blames others for her actions rather than taking responsibility. The pattern appears chronic and occurs across multiple settings.

3. **Conduct Disorder, Childhood-Onset Type - F91.1**

She displays aggression toward others through hitting classmates and throwing objects, with a clear behavioral pattern across time and settings. However, the clinical picture lacks sufficient evidence of other conduct disorder features like deceitfulness, stealing, or deliberate property destruction beyond the isolated tissue box incident. Her aggressive responses appear reactive rather than calculated or instrumental.

4. **Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD) - F94.1** or **Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder**

Her background includes documented pathogenic care with parental unfitness and state custody, along with multiple placement changes. While the history strongly suggests considering attachment-related disorders—RAD characterized by withdrawn attachment behaviors versus DSED marked by indiscriminate social approach—the current vignette provides limited specific information about her actual attachment presentation.

5. **Unspecified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder - F43.9** or **Adjustment Disorder with disturbance of conduct - F43.24**

Her adverse experiences including parental loss, separation, and repeated placement disruptions likely contribute meaningfully to her current behavioral difficulties.

6. **ADHD - F90.x**

She interrupts during the interview and demonstrates impulsive behavior, though there's insufficient detail about sustained attention, concentration difficulties, or academic performance to fully evaluate this diagnosis.

7. **Intermittent Explosive Disorder - F63.81**

This wouldn't apply here since she's under 6 years old; DMDD or ODD would be the appropriate diagnoses at this developmental stage, as DSM-5 requires at least 6 years chronologically or equivalent developmental level.

The most compelling diagnosis appears to be DMDD, which best captures her chronic irritability combined with recurrent severe outbursts across multiple environments and fits her age appropriately. ODD could be considered as a secondary option if DMDD criteria aren't fully satisfied, though DMDD takes diagnostic precedence when both conditions are present.

Since the question requires five diagnoses, I should evaluate additional possibilities. Conduct Disorder could be relevant given the physical aggression toward peers, though she'd need to meet at least three criteria across behavioral categories in the past year—currently only aggression is documented. Trauma- and stressor-related disorders or Reactive Attachment Disorder warrant consideration given her early adversity and disrupted attachment history, which may be driving the behavioral presentation. ADHD, particularly the hyperactive-impulsive or combined presentation, is also worth examining based on her impulsivity and interrupting behaviors, though the evidence is limited.

Importantly, DSM-5-TR specifies that DMDD and ODD cannot coexist—DMDD takes precedence when criteria are met. However, since the question asks for five diagnoses, I should present the differential diagnoses that would be considered: DMDD as primary, ODD as an alternative if DMDD criteria aren't fully satisfied, Conduct Disorder for the aggressive behaviors, Reactive Attachment Disorder for the attachment and early adversity factors, and an unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder to capture any remaining symptomatology related to her history.

Reconsidering the actual comorbidities that can occur with DMDD—ADHD, Conduct Disorder, and substance use disorders are permissible, but ODD, Intermittent Explosive Disorder, and bipolar disorder are not. So the most defensible list would include DMDD as the primary diagnosis, Conduct Disorder as a comorbid condition given the aggressive behaviors, ADHD as a possible comorbidity given the impulsivity and interrupting, and Reactive Attachment Disorder reflecting the early trauma and attachment disruption.

For the trauma-related component, an unspecified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder fits given the documented history, though PTSD unspecified could also apply if the trauma details remain unclear. The case presentation emphasizes the chronic irritable mood between explosive episodes—the guardian's observation that ""she seems to be irritable in general"" is the critical feature distinguishing DMDD from ODD alone. Intermittent Explosive Disorder doesn't fit here because it cannot coexist with DMDD, ODD, or Conduct Disorder, and the presentation is more consistent with a mood dysregulation pattern than isolated explosive episodes. Adjustment disorders seem less fitting given how long this has persisted.

The differential should still include Oppositional Defiant Disorder as a key consideration before settling on the final diagnosis, since both present with defiance and irritability—but the sustained irritable baseline across situations points more toward DMDD as the primary diagnosis.

Looking at the specific presentation: arguing, defiance, blaming others, easy annoyance, and resentment align with ODD criteria. However, the severe temper outbursts occurring multiple times weekly combined with the persistent irritable mood between episodes better fits the DMDD profile. The revised list prioritizes DMDD while maintaining ODD as the critical differential, followed by Conduct Disorder, Reactive Attachment Disorder, and ADHD. Given the presentation, I'm considering trauma and attachment issues as contributing factors. The history of instability and loss of parental figures suggests Reactive Attachment Disorder could be relevant. ADHD remains on the differential since impulsivity and emotional dysregulation can overlap with attention difficulties. I'll prioritize DMDD and ODD as primary diagnoses, then add RAD, an unspecified trauma-related disorder, and ADHD as additional considerations that may be contributing to the behavioral presentation.","1.

**Data Extraction and Organization:**

Demographics:
- 12-year-old male

Presenting Problem:
- Multiple school detentions for behavior problems
- Brought by mother

Behavioral Symptoms at School:
- Does not follow instructions in class
- Becomes argumentative with teachers
- Disrespectful behavior
- Uses profanities against teachers and staff

Behavioral Symptoms at Home:
- Refuses to do chores
- Argues with mother about homework
- Mocks mother when confronted
- Intentionally creates more chores/messes and doesn't clean them up (deliberately annoying behavior)

- Eye rolling when asked about behaviors
- Tells evaluator ""it's none of your business""
- Kicks the desk (irritable, possibly aggressive)
- Identifies mother as source of stress

Negative Findings:
- Denies depression
- Denies suicidal ideation

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

The key features here are:
1. Pattern of angry/irritable mood
2. Argumentative/defiant behavior toward authority figures (teachers, mother)
3. Vindictive behavior (intentionally making messes)
4. Behavior occurs in multiple settings (home and school)
5. Duration not explicitly stated but seems ongoing

**Primary consideration: Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) - F91.3**

DSM-5-TR criteria for ODD include:
A. A pattern of angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behavior, or vindictiveness lasting at least 6 months with at least 4 symptoms:

Angry/Irritable Mood:
- Often loses temper (possibly present)
- Often touchy or easily annoyed (likely present - ""rolls eyes,"" ""kicks desk"")
- Often angry and resentful (not clearly stated)

Argumentative/Defiant Behavior:
- Often argues with authority figures (YES - with teachers and mother)


- Often actively defies or refuses to comply with rules/requests (YES - not following instructions, refusing chores)
- Often deliberately annoys others (YES - creates messes intentionally)
- Often blames others for mistakes/behavior (possibly - blames mom)

Vindictiveness:
- Has been spiteful or vindictive (YES - intentionally creates messes)

The behavior is present in multiple settings (home and school), which affects the severity specifier. I need to assess whether this meets criteria for Conduct Disorder as well, though the vignette doesn't describe aggression toward people or animals, property destruction, or serious rule violations that would suggest that diagnosis.

ADHD is worth considering given the difficulty following instructions, but the defiance appears more willful than inattentive, and there's limited evidence of hyperactivity or impulsivity. Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder requires severe recurrent temper outbursts that aren't present here.

The differential narrows to ODD as the primary diagnosis—the pattern of argumentative and defiant behavior is well-established, with clear hostility toward authority figures and resistance to rules.

Conduct Disorder remains a secondary consideration, though the presentation lacks the aggression, property destruction, or serious rule violations typically seen in that diagnosis. ADHD warrants consideration given the difficulty following instructions, though evidence is limited.

Key clinical information extracted:

Demographics:
- 15-year-old male
- Lives with grandmother

Timeline:
- ""Past few months"" - duration of symptoms
- Grandmother states ""he has never acted like this before"" - represents a change from baseline
- Previously described as ""a bright boy with a lot of friends""

Symptoms/Behavioral Changes:
1. Irritability and anger at home (mood symptom)
2. Social withdrawal - spending more time alone in room
3. Lashing out when asked to spend time with family
4. Decreased time with friends (social withdrawal)
5. Declining academic performance (grades dropped)
6. Negative cognitions: ""school is stupid and pointless""
7. Feelings of worthlessness/hopelessness: ""not going to amount to anything anyways""
8. Appears tired - fatigue
9. Hypersomnia - spending more time napping
10. Anhedonia - loss of interest in games he previously enjoyed, ""games are boring""
11. Feeling of boredom (could represent anhedonia)
12. Dismissive of help - thinks coming to clinic is ""dumb"" and ""waste of everyone's time""

Diagnostic considerations:

1. Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):
- Duration: past few months (>2 weeks criterion met)
- Depressed mood can manifest as irritability in adolescents (criterion A)
- Anhedonia present (loss of interest in games)
- Sleep changes (hypersomnia)
- Fatigue/low energy (appears tired)
- Worthlessness (""not going to amount to anything"")
- Concentration/academic decline
- Social withdrawal
- Change from previous functioning (previously bright, had friends)

This presentation strongly suggests Major Depressive Disorder. In adolescents, irritability can be a primary mood manifestation. The constellation of symptoms meets DSM-5-TR criteria for MDD.


Dysthymia would require a year-long course in adolescents, but he's only had symptoms for a few months. DMDD doesn't fit either—it needs severe temper outbursts over 12+ months with onset before age 10. An adjustment disorder is possible if there's an identifiable stressor, but none is mentioned in the case.

I should also consider medical and substance-related causes: thyroid dysfunction could explain the fatigue and sleep changes, substance use might account for mood shifts in an adolescent, and while social withdrawal could suggest anxiety or early psychosis, there are no psychotic features present.

The clinical picture points most strongly to Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode. He has the core symptoms—irritable mood (typical in adolescent depression), loss of interest, excessive sleep, low energy, feelings of worthlessness, and difficulty concentrating (reflected in declining grades)—all present for more than two weeks with clear functional decline across school, social, and family domains. The moderate-to-severe range fits given how significantly his functioning has deteriorated.

For coding, F32.1 or F32.2 would be appropriate depending on severity assessment. Other diagnoses warrant consideration: Oppositional Defiant Disorder could explain irritability but seems secondary to the depressive presentation; Adjustment Disorder if a specific stressor emerges; Persistent Depressive Disorder if symptoms have been longer-standing than reported; ADHD given academic problems, though evidence is limited; and Social Anxiety Disorder given the social withdrawal, though this appears more consistent with anhedonia and depression.

The clinical picture aligns most closely with adolescent Major Depressive Disorder. The primary differential should focus on whether this represents a moderate single episode (F32.1) or an unspecified presentation (F32.9), with severity potentially escalating to F32.2 if psychotic features develop or functioning deteriorates further.

Alternative diagnoses to consider include Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood (F43.21) if a clear precipitant exists, Persistent Depressive Disorder (F34.1) if the timeline suggests chronic rather than acute onset, Oppositional Defiant Disorder (F91.3) given the prominent irritability and anger responses, and Unspecified Depressive Disorder (F32) as a catch-all if the presentation doesn't fully meet criteria for a specific subtype.","1.

- Physical altercation with classmate
- Brought to ER after fighting

- Increased goal-directed activity: Wants to start campaigning immediately
- Agitation/aggression: Physical altercation

Substance use:
- Currently smells like marijuana
- Bloodshot eyes (consistent with recent marijuana use)
- Started smoking marijuana a couple weeks ago (recent onset)
- No prior substance use history per girlfriend

Past psychiatric history (collateral from girlfriend):
- Previous episode ""a few months ago"":
  - Elevated energy
  - Grandiose plans (becoming Dean of school)
  - Decreased need for sleep (stayed up late, girlfriend unsure if he slept much at all)
  - Impulsive spending (entire monthly allowance on gifts in one week)
  - Episode lasted approximately a week before ""crashing"" (sleeping for half a day)
- History of ""odd"" behavior but no prior aggression

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

The key clinical features to consider:
1. Current manic symptoms: grandiosity (messianic delusions), increased goal-directed activity, pressured speech implied, decreased need for sleep
2. Psychotic features: delusions (grandiose and persecutory/paranoid)
3. History of prior manic episode (a few months ago with classic manic symptoms)


4. Recent cannabis initiation (started 2 weeks ago) as a potential contributing factor

**Differential Diagnosis:**

Bipolar I Disorder with current manic episode and psychotic features stands out as the primary consideration. The presentation aligns with classic mania—grandiose and persecutory delusions, heightened energy, reduced sleep need, and impulsive behavior—and the prior episode from months ago showed similar manic characteristics including decreased sleep, grandiose thinking, and impulsive spending. The mood-congruent psychotic features (grandiose delusions fitting the elevated mood state) further support this diagnosis.

Cannabis-induced psychosis seems less likely despite recent use and current intoxication, since the previous episode occurred before marijuana use began two weeks ago. This temporal relationship suggests an underlying mood disorder rather than substance-induced psychosis as the primary etiology. Schizoaffective disorder is less probable given that psychotic symptoms appear tied to mood episodes rather than occurring independently. Brief psychotic disorder remains on the differential but requires assessment of episode duration and course.

Schizophrenia is unlikely—the prominent affective component, episodic pattern with return to baseline, and absence of negative symptoms all point away from this diagnosis. Cannabis intoxication is clearly present as a concurrent condition but doesn't account for the full clinical picture. The most consistent diagnosis is Bipolar I Disorder in a current manic episode with severe psychotic features, supported by the constellation of elevated mood, grandiosity, decreased sleep need, increased goal-directed activity, impulsive financial decisions, and grandiose delusions regarding messianic beliefs.

The psychotic symptoms—both grandiose and persecutory delusions—fit within the manic episode framework. Critically, the patient's history of prior similar episodes before any cannabis exposure indicates this isn't substance-induced psychosis. Secondary considerations include cannabis intoxication (evident from appearance and smell) and possible cannabis use disorder given the recent initiation two weeks ago, though severity assessment is limited. While cannabis-induced psychotic disorder could theoretically apply, the pre-existing episodic pattern makes bipolar disorder the primary diagnosis. with intoxication. Given the brief two-week history of cannabis use, establishing mild use disorder criteria is challenging, though intoxication is clearly evident. The primary diagnosis remains Bipolar I Disorder, Current Episode Manic, Severe with Psychotic Features, with cannabis intoxication as a secondary factor. Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type, and cannabis-induced psychotic disorder warrant consideration in the differential, though the manic presentation and timeline better support the bipolar diagnosis.","1.

**Differential Diagnosis Considerations:**

1. **Prolonged Grief Disorder (F43.8)** - The patient lost her mother 2 months ago. However, for PGD, symptoms typically need to persist for at least 12 months (or 6 months in some cultures) after the loss. At 2 months, this would be too early for this diagnosis. However, she shows features of intense grief, yearning (feeling mother's presence), identity disruption.

2. **Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode (F32.x)** - She has depressed mood, decreased appetite, weight loss, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, anhedonia, and guilt. These meet criteria for MDD. The stressor (mother's suicide) is significant but doesn't preclude MDD diagnosis. She has enough symptoms and functional impairment to warrant this diagnosis.

3. **Acute Stress Disorder vs. PTSD (F43.0 vs F43.1x)** - The traumatic discovery of her mother's body qualifies as a traumatic stressor. She experiences nightmares and avoidance behaviors. Since 2 months have elapsed, PTSD would be the appropriate diagnosis if criteria are met, as ASD only applies within the first month post-trauma.

4. **Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood (F43.23)** - While symptoms emerged within 3 months of the identifiable stressor, their severity suggests MDD or PTSD may better account for the presentation, which would supersede this diagnosis.

5. **Bipolar Disorder** - The minimal sleep requirement (2-3 hours with maintained energy) and increased sexual risk-taking warrant consideration of hypomanic features. However, the predominantly depressive picture and the likelihood that sleep disruption stems from grief and trauma rather than true decreased need for sleep make this less probable. The risky sexual behavior appears more consistent with maladaptive coping than mood elevation.

6. **Uncomplicated Bereavement** - Normal grief wouldn't explain the passive suicidal ideation and significant functional decline, so this diagnosis seems inadequate.

The timeline of two months combined with the traumatic circumstances—discovering her mother's body—and the constellation of symptoms points most strongly toward PTSD. The intrusive nightmares, avoidance behaviors, guilt, concentration problems, and insomnia align with the diagnostic criteria. Major Depressive Disorder also fits given the pervasive low mood and anhedonia, and both conditions could coexist.

Prolonged Grief Disorder has some features present—the yearning, difficulty accepting the death, identity disruption—but can't be formally diagnosed until 12 months have passed. Adjustment Disorder remains a possibility if the symptom severity falls short of MDD or PTSD thresholds, though the passive SI suggests more than a typical adjustment response.

There's a concerning pattern worth examining more closely: sleeping only 2-3 hours nightly without feeling tired the next day suggests decreased need for sleep rather than typical insomnia. This, paired with increased goal-directed activity like the nighttime walks and escalated sexual risk-taking, raises the possibility of a mixed or hypomanic presentation. The predominant depressive features could mask an underlying bipolar process, though grief and trauma-related behavioral changes might account for these shifts instead.

Given her lack of prior psychiatric history and the clear traumatic context, the clinical picture leans heavily toward trauma and mood disturbance rather than a primary bipolar disorder. The most likely diagnoses are PTSD with prominent depressive symptoms, a major depressive episode in response to the trauma, or possibly prolonged grief disorder if the loss is the primary driver. An adjustment disorder remains possible if full criteria for the others aren't met. The history of sexual abuse at age 18 suggests underlying trauma vulnerability that may be contributing to current self-destructive patterns, including the promiscuous behavior. This context is important for understanding the full clinical picture.

My primary diagnoses are PTSD—given the traumatic exposure from discovering her mother's body, intrusive nightmares, avoidance behaviors, negative cognitive shifts including guilt, and sleep disturbance—and Major Depressive Disorder with moderate severity, evidenced by depressive symptoms and passive suicidal ideation. Prolonged Grief Disorder is also relevant given the intense yearning, sense of her mother's presence, guilt, and identity disruption, though it requires monitoring since the 12-month criterion hasn't been met. I'm considering Adjustment Disorder as an alternative if the full criteria for MDD or PTSD aren't satisfied. The decreased need for sleep alongside increased risky behavior also warrants ruling out a bipolar presentation, though this seems lower in the differential. nightmares of the event presumably), I think PTSD should be primary with comorbid MDD. The trauma-specific symptoms and the precipitating event of discovering her mother's body make posttraumatic stress disorder the most prominent diagnosis, with major depressive disorder as a significant secondary condition. Prolonged grief disorder, adjustment disorder, and bipolar spectrum concerns round out the differential, though they're less central to the clinical picture.","1.

**Key Clinical Information:**

1. **Demographics:** 25-year-old female

2. **Presenting symptoms and current episode:**
   - Admitted involuntarily for altered mental status
   - Bizarre movements - falling back, rolling on the ground
   - Not eaten much in 4-5 days
   - Sitting at one spot for most of the day (possible psychomotor retardation/catatonia)
   - Minimal engagement
   - Response to Lorazepam 2mg IM - helpful, able to talk more (this is a positive response suggesting catatonia)

3. **Recent history (past week before the altered state):**
   - Unable to sleep
   - Cleaning house ""vivaciously"" at night
   - Going out for walks for 3 hours
   - Feeling great with energy
   - Bought a brand-new Mercedes (possibly impulsive spending beyond means)
   - Then ""crashing down"" - confused, altered for past 2 days
   - ""Not making any sense in what she says""

4. **Psychiatric History:**
   - History of depression
   - Started on Sertraline 50mg daily 3 months ago
   - Was compliant with medications
   - Mother died 3 months ago (cancer)
   - Depressive symptoms after mother's death: missing mom, felt depressed, stopped eating, sleep problems, felt hopeless, low energy
   - Noticed improvement in symptoms for the past month

5. **Medical workup:**
   - Mild elevation in BUN, normal creatinine
   - Normal LFTs

   - Low hemoglobin 10.1 with MCV 70 (microcytic anemia - possibly iron deficiency)
   - Negative UDS
   - Negative pregnancy test
   - No other past medical problems
   - No allergies
   - Denied substance use
   
The pattern here is striking - she experienced depression after her mother's death, responded to Sertraline, but then shifted into a hyperactive state with decreased sleep, increased productivity, and impulsive spending. The subsequent crash into confusion and bizarre movements with catatonic features responding to benzodiazepines points toward a mood disorder with psychotic or catatonic features. The Sertraline may have precipitated a manic or mixed episode in someone with underlying bipolar vulnerability. to medical conditions like the mild electrolyte abnormalities and anemia, though these seem insufficient to fully explain the presentation. Brief Psychotic Disorder is less likely given the sustained mood disturbance rather than isolated psychotic symptoms.

The clinical trajectory strongly suggests Bipolar I Disorder, current manic episode with severe catatonic features. The pattern of initial depression following bereavement, improvement with sertraline, then escalation into decreased sleep, heightened goal-directed activity, and possible impulsive spending followed by catatonia is characteristic of bipolar illness. The sertraline likely precipitated the manic switch in someone with underlying bipolar vulnerability.

Other diagnostic considerations include delirium, which needs exclusion given the confusion and altered cognition, and adjustment disorder, though the symptom severity exceeds what would be expected from bereavement alone. For ICD-10 coding, F31.2 (Bipolar I Disorder, current episode manic severe with psychotic features) appears most appropriate, though the specific catatonic specifier coding requires careful attention to the classification system being used. depressive episode, though the bipolar diagnosis would take precedence. I should also consider delirium given the altered mental status and confusion, which would need to be ruled out. Brief Psychotic Disorder is another possibility if psychotic features are confirmed, but the presentation seems more consistent with severe mania with catatonic features.

The primary diagnosis should be Bipolar I Disorder, current episode manic, severe, with catatonia as a specifier. The differential includes catatonia associated with another mental disorder, delirium due to medical causes, and Brief Psychotic Disorder if psychotic symptoms are present.

Looking at the DSM-5-TR codes more carefully: Bipolar I with current manic episode ranges from F31.11 (mild) to F31.13 (severe), with F31.2 for psychotic features. The catatonia specifier applies separately. The friend's account points to clear manic symptoms—reduced need for sleep, elevated energy, increased goal-directed activity—followed by the catatonic presentation with altered mental status. This could represent either a severe manic episode with catatonic features, a mixed episode with catatonia, or rapid cycling between states.

The ""crashing down"" quality suggests possible mixed features or a depressive shift. Given the incoherent speech and altered mental status, psychotic features seem likely. I'd code this as Bipolar I Disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features (F31.2), plus Catatonia associated with another mental disorder (F06.1)—the Lorazepam response supports the catatonia diagnosis, and the bizarre presentation fits both conditions.

The altered cognition and confusion warrant ruling out delirium with medical workup. While there's a history of depression that resolved, this wouldn't be coded separately under the bipolar diagnosis. Brief Psychotic Disorder is worth considering given the acute onset, though the manic presentation and treatment response point more toward the bipolar spectrum. The key revision: if this is Bipolar I, the depressive history gets subsumed into that diagnosis rather than coded as a separate major depressive episode.

3. Delirium needs to be ruled out given the altered mental status. Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar type could apply if psychotic symptoms extend beyond mood episodes. Brief Psychotic Disorder remains a consideration if mood disturbance isn't the primary feature. Other diagnoses like Prolonged Grief Disorder or Adjustment Disorder seem less consistent with the severity and symptom presentation here.

The psychotic features—particularly the incoherent speech and disorganized thinking—suggest F31.2 (Bipolar I with psychotic features) is the primary diagnosis. Catatonia appears significant enough to warrant a separate notation. The differential also includes Unspecified Delirium, Schizoaffective Disorder Bipolar type, and Brief Psychotic Disorder with marked stressor(s). The catatonic presentation is particularly noteworthy in the diagnostic picture.

Reconsidering the DSM-5-TR framework, catatonia can present as a specifier for mood disorders, a separate diagnosis (F06.1), or related to medical conditions. Since Bipolar I seems primary, the catatonia could be coded as a specifier, though listing F06.1 separately helps emphasize this prominent feature. The final diagnosis list should prioritize Bipolar I Disorder, current episode manic, severe (F31.13 or F31.2 depending on whether psychotic features are present), followed by Catatonia associated with another mental disorder (F06.1), and Delirium as a third diagnosis.","1.

This makes her anxious to the point of getting paralyzed and cannot concentrate on her work. When she goes back home, she can do better. She is calmer and can enjoy time with friends and family. She goes out of walks and laughs and spends time with her loved ones. She tells her friend she feels lonely in college and does not have many friends and always under stress to do better. She is obsessive about “doing better” and compulsive about “studying” but denied any intrusive thoughts. She denied any medical problems, denied any allergies and history of substance use.

**Data Extraction and Organization:**

Demographics:
- 19-year-old female
- University student
- Aspires to become a physician

Timeline:
- Symptoms started 3 months ago at the beginning of the school year
- Symptoms are context-dependent (worse at school, better at home)

Chief Complaint:
- Increased anxiety symptoms

Presenting Symptoms:

1. Generalized Anxiety Symptoms:
- Feels anxious ""most of the days"" for 3 months
- Worry about academic performance/success
- Somatic symptoms: increased heart rate, sweating, racing thoughts, sleep problems
- Physical symptoms when severe: difficulty breathing, nausea

2. Social Anxiety Symptoms:
- ""Frozen with fear"" when called on by teacher
- Fear of saying something ""ill-informed or inappropriate""
- Difficulty engaging with peers at college
- Anxious about ability to make friends
- Panic-like symptoms triggered by presenting in front of classmates
- Worries about what others are thinking, that they're laughing at her or talking about her

3. Panic-like Episodes:
- Racing thoughts
- Heavy breathing
- Numbness
- Does NOT have fear of dying
- Triggered specifically by social situations (presentations in front of class)
- NOT spontaneous/unexpected

4. Academic/Perfectionism Concerns:
- ""Obsessive"" about doing better
- ""Compulsive"" about studying
- BUT denies intrusive thoughts (this rules out OCD)

Context-Dependent:
- Symptoms worse at school
- At home: calmer, enjoys time with friends and family, goes on walks, laughs, spends time with loved ones
- Can engage well with familiar people (friends and family at home)

Negative History:
- No medical problems
- No allergies
- No substance use
- No past psychiatric history


- No prior diagnoses or medications

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

Social Anxiety Disorder stands out as the primary diagnosis. The pattern is clear: she experiences marked fear in social evaluation situations—being called on in class, presenting to classmates—with specific worry about negative judgment and saying something inappropriate. Her anxiety about peer relationships and the belief that others are judging or talking about her further supports this. The symptoms are clearly tied to social contexts at school and significantly interfere with her academic engagement and social functioning.

The timeline and context matter here. Her symptoms have persisted for several months, and notably, she functions well in familiar settings with family and close friends. This distinction is crucial—it points toward social anxiety rather than a more generalized anxiety pattern.

Generalized Anxiety Disorder could also apply given her pervasive worry, multiple physical symptoms (heart racing, sweating, sleep disruption, breathing difficulties, nausea), and difficulty controlling anxious thoughts. However, her worry centers specifically on academic performance and social evaluation rather than spanning multiple life domains. Additionally, while she's had symptoms for three months, GAD technically requires a six-month duration.

Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety warrants consideration given that her symptoms emerged at a specific point—the start of the school year—suggesting a stressor-triggered response rather than an underlying anxiety condition.

Panic Disorder seems unlikely since her episodes are predictable and tied to social contexts rather than occurring spontaneously. She doesn't report fear of death or serious harm, and her symptoms align more with limited panic-like responses within social anxiety.

OCD can be excluded because she denies intrusive thoughts, and her drive to study harder and perform better reflects perfectionism rather than true obsessions and compulsions.

The clinical picture points most strongly to Social Anxiety Disorder as the primary diagnosis. Her fear centers on social evaluation, she experiences marked anxiety in school social situations, and this causes significant functional impairment in peer relationships and academic performance.

The temporal relationship to starting school and her ability to function well at home with familiar people also raises Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety as a secondary consideration. Generalized Anxiety Disorder is less likely given the focused nature of her worries and the context-dependent symptoms. Panic Disorder and Unspecified Anxiety Disorder are less probable given the triggered nature of her anxiety and the specificity of her presentation.","1.

Current mental status indicators:
- Denies current suicidal ideation (though recent suicide attempt 3 weeks ago)

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

The key diagnostic considerations are:

1. **Schizophrenia (F20.9)**:
- Criterion A: At least 2 of: (1) delusions ✓ (persecutory, thought broadcasting), (2) hallucinations ✓ (auditory), (3) disorganized speech, (4) disorganized/catatonic behavior, (5) negative symptoms ✓ (avolition, social withdrawal, poor hygiene)
- Duration: Symptoms present for approximately 6 months with functional decline. The mother notes changes beginning about 6 months ago with progressive deterioration. Family history of schizophrenia (maternal grandmother) and typical age of onset for males (25 years) support this diagnosis.

However, I need to consider the timeline more carefully. The psychotic symptoms (hallucinations and delusions) have been present for 1 month, while the prodromal/negative symptoms appear to have started earlier at 6 months ago. For schizophrenia, I need at least 6 months of symptoms with at least 1 month of active-phase symptoms.

Schizophreniform disorder could apply if the total duration falls between 1-6 months, meeting the same symptom criteria but with a shorter timeframe. Given the case suggests approximately 6 months of change with explicit psychotic symptoms for 1 month, this diagnosis might be appropriate if I can't confirm the full 6-month schizophrenia timeline. Brief psychotic disorder requires symptoms lasting 1 day to less than 1 month, so the 1-month duration makes this less likely. Schizoaffective disorder requires a major mood episode concurrent with schizophrenia symptoms—he does have depressive symptoms, but they appear secondary to the psychotic experience rather than meeting full mood episode criteria.

Major depressive disorder with psychotic features is less probable since depression emerged 3 months ago while the psychotic symptoms seem primary and not mood-congruent; his delusions about being followed and thought broadcasting don't fit typical depressive psychosis, and his negative symptoms extend beyond what depression alone would explain. The clinical picture points toward a primary psychotic disorder rather than a mood disorder with secondary psychosis. If specific diagnostic criteria aren't fully met, unspecified schizophrenia spectrum disorder would be the fallback diagnosis.

The constellation of clear psychotic symptoms—delusions, hallucinations, and negative symptoms persisting over a month—combined with functional decline beginning 6 months ago and a family history of schizophrenia, suggests schizophrenia as the primary diagnosis. The prodromal features (negative symptoms and functional decline) likely represent the earlier phase of illness, with the acute psychotic symptoms emerging more recently. If the full 6-month duration criterion is met including prodromal symptoms, schizophrenia fits best; otherwise, schizophreniform disorder would be the more conservative diagnosis given the 1-month duration of active psychotic symptoms.

The differential also includes schizophreniform disorder if the timeline doesn't quite reach 6 months, major depressive disorder with psychotic features (though the psychotic symptoms appear primary rather than mood-congruent), and schizoaffective disorder given the concurrent depressive symptoms, though these seem secondary to the psychotic experience rather than equally prominent. d Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder - F29.

**Clinical Analysis:**

The key features here are:


1. Sudden onset of auditory hallucinations with command content (1 day)
2. Disorientation to time and place suggesting delirium rather than primary psychosis
3. Autonomic hyperactivity with elevated BP and heart rate
4. Prior alcohol withdrawal seizures and recent relapse after 3 years sobriety
5. Timeline fits alcohol withdrawal (last drink 3 days ago)
6. Paranoid and visual features alongside the auditory hallucinations
7. Severe agitation and fear requiring restraint

**Differential Diagnosis:**

1. **Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium (Delirium Tremens)**
- Most consistent with presentation given the 48-96 hour window since last drink, prior seizure history, disorientation, visual/paranoid ideation, and autonomic instability all pointing to this diagnosis

2. **Severe Alcohol Use Disorder**
- Underlying condition driving the acute withdrawal state, with pattern of relapse after extended sobriety

3. **Alcohol-Induced Psychotic Disorder**
- Auditory hallucinations could represent this, though the delirium and autonomic findings make withdrawal delirium the primary consideration

Depression appears in her history from 3 years ago and mother notes recent low mood with poor appetite, but the acute delirium dominates the clinical picture. Recent stressors around work, family, and relocation plans may have triggered the relapse, though anxiety and adjustment issues are secondary to the acute medical emergency of withdrawal.

For coding purposes, alcohol withdrawal delirium maps to F10.231, with the underlying severe alcohol use disorder requiring separate documentation. d is now presenting with depressive symptoms (anhedonia, hopelessness, guilt). This appears to be a recurrent episode.

4. **Generalized Anxiety Disorder** - F41.1
Chronic anxiety symptoms present alongside the depression and alcohol use.

5. **History of Seizures** - R56.9 or G40.x if epilepsy
Document the seizure history, particularly important given alcohol withdrawal risk.

The primary focus should be on stabilizing the acute withdrawal delirium with benzodiazepines and supportive care, while addressing the underlying alcohol use disorder and comorbid psychiatric conditions once acute symptoms resolve.

The patient's presentation fits delirium tremens with the disorientation, hallucinations, autonomic instability, and agitation occurring three days after last alcohol use. The moderate alcohol use disorder and recurrent depression with current depressive features need concurrent treatment. Anxiety and seizure history are relevant for comprehensive management. the disorientation to time and place, perceptual disturbances, and autonomic hyperactivity all point to delirium tremens as the primary diagnosis. Beyond that, I'm noting the moderate alcohol use disorder, the depressive symptoms that seem to be recurring based on her history, some anxiety features tied to recent life changes, and an adjustment reaction to the stressors around work and relocation.

I should be careful not to over-diagnose here. The acute withdrawal delirium is what demands immediate attention, and the alcohol use disorder severity needs to be captured. The depression and anxiety appear secondary to the acute presentation and the chronic substance use pattern. My final diagnoses focus on what's clinically most pressing: the delirium tremens, the underlying severe alcohol use disorder given the history of withdrawal seizures, and the recurrent depressive disorder that's been part of her clinical picture. The anxiety symptoms reported by the mother over several days could be captured under F41.9, though there's overlap with adjustment-related anxiety. Given the recent relapse and stressors, alcohol-induced mood and anxiety disorders (F10.24 and F10.280) might be more precise than general anxiety or adjustment disorder codes. The depressive symptoms could stem from alcohol use itself rather than primary depression, and the anxiety appears connected to withdrawal. Refining the diagnosis list to prioritize alcohol-induced conditions alongside the withdrawal delirium and use disorder seems more clinically accurate. she has withdrawal delirium, which is the most specific and comprehensive code. F10.231 captures both the dependence and the acute delirium manifestation, so I don't need a separate code for uncomplicated dependence. For her psychiatric history, Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, in Partial Remission (F33.41) remains appropriate, and I'll code her anxiety as Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9) given the current presentation in the context of withdrawal. The anxiety presentation over just a few days doesn't fit generalized anxiety disorder—it's more likely part of the withdrawal syndrome or an adjustment response. I should focus on the most defensible diagnoses: the acute delirium is primary, the alcohol use disorder is severe based on the presentation, and the depressive history needs documentation. The anxiety could be alcohol-induced rather than a separate disorder, which would reduce diagnostic redundancy. I'm settling on the core diagnoses that directly explain the clinical picture without overlap. the psychotic features are secondary to the delirium itself, so listing them separately would be redundant. The timing and presentation—disorientation, autonomic instability, hallucinations occurring 3 days post-cessation—all point to withdrawal delirium rather than a primary psychotic disorder. Wernicke encephalopathy is worth considering given the alcohol history, but the absence of ataxia and ophthalmoplegia makes it less likely. My primary diagnosis remains alcohol withdrawal delirium, with severe alcohol use disorder and possible emerging depression as secondary considerations. to moderate or severe alcohol use disorder. The F10.231 code already captures the dependence component, so including F10.20 separately creates redundancy. I should consolidate to avoid duplicate coding while still capturing the clinical picture. Considering whether the depressive symptoms might be alcohol-induced rather than a primary mood disorder—F10.24 could apply if the depression is directly attributable to alcohol use. I'm also weighing whether psychotic features like alcohol hallucinosis should be considered in the differential.

The most parsimonious approach focuses on the acute presentation: alcohol withdrawal delirium as the primary diagnosis, with historical major depressive disorder noted, and recent alcohol-induced mood and anxiety symptoms captured separately. This avoids redundancy while acknowledging both the acute crisis and underlying psychiatric comorbidities.

The clinical picture aligns precisely with delirium tremens—an alcohol-dependent individual three days post-cessation, with prior seizure episodes during withdrawal, now presenting with disorientation, hallucinations, autonomic instability, and marked agitation. The secondary considerations include the severe underlying alcohol dependence evidenced by the seizure history and any residual depressive features from the documented psychiatric background.

The differential diagnosis centers on alcohol withdrawal delirium as the primary concern, alongside the documented major depressive disorder and severe alcohol use disorder. There's also consideration of whether her depression from years prior was alcohol-induced and resolved with sobriety, though without additional clarity, treating it as a legitimate depressive episode that achieved remission seems most appropriate. The recent stressor may have precipitated the relapse that led to this acute presentation. I need to verify the correct codes for alcohol-induced psychotic disorder. For dependence with hallucinations, it's F10.259, not F10.951. However, since F10.231 already captures the withdrawal delirium with its psychotic features, adding a separate psychotic disorder code would be redundant. I should consider an alternative diagnosis for the fifth code—perhaps panic disorder given her presentation.

Looking at other possibilities: panic disorder (F41.0) fits her acute panic-like symptoms, though agoraphobia doesn't apply. Brief psychotic disorder is ruled out due to the substance etiology. Delirium from a medical condition (F05) could be relevant if there's concern about an underlying cause, but her acute confusion and anxiety in an unfamiliar, stressful environment suggest situational factors are primary.

My final diagnoses are: alcohol withdrawal delirium (F10.231), major depressive disorder recurrent in partial remission (F33.41), severe alcohol use disorder (F10.20), unspecified anxiety disorder (F41.9), and adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood (F43.23). I'm reconsidering whether major depressive disorder truly applies here.

The sadness she's experiencing now appears reactive to the frightening hallucinations rather than a true depressive episode, though her mother noted decreased appetite and low mood over the past 4-5 days. This could represent an emerging recurrence, adjustment reaction, prodromal withdrawal symptoms, or alcohol-induced mood changes. Given her history and the mother's observations, I'll include major depressive disorder in the differential while acknowledging it could alternatively be adjustment or alcohol-induced.

For the final list, alcohol withdrawal delirium takes priority as the acute presentation, followed by major depressive disorder given her history and current symptoms. Alcohol use disorder is the underlying condition driving the acute picture. Adjustment disorder with mixed features and unspecified anxiety disorder are less clearly defined but warrant consideration. Since F10.231 already captures alcohol dependence with withdrawal delirium, I don't need to separately code the dependence component—that's already embedded in the withdrawal delirium code. The primary diagnosis is alcohol withdrawal delirium. For secondary diagnoses, I need to distinguish between active conditions, historical presentations, and differential considerations. The underlying alcohol use disorder is essential since it directly causes the withdrawal state. Major depressive disorder appears in her history and may be recurring. Recent stressors suggest an adjustment disorder component, and I should consider whether mood symptoms stem from alcohol-induced effects versus primary depression. A clinically sound differential would prioritize the acute withdrawal, the severe underlying substance use disorder, any recurrent mood disorder, and potential adjustment or alcohol-induced mood presentations.","1.

- Duration: 7 months
- Precipitating event: Friend's mother passed away

Core Symptoms:
1. Excessive anxiety specifically related to separation from mother
2. Worry about harm befalling mother (accident, losing her, something bad happening)
3. Racing thoughts about various bad scenarios
4. Difficulty concentrating/focusing at school
5. Declining grades
6. Not submitting assignments on time
7. Sleep disturbance - nightmares specifically about mom leaving him
8. Social withdrawal - friends have drifted away, feels lonely at school

- When at home with mom, he enjoys spending time with her, helping in kitchen, doing chores
- No auditory or visual hallucinations
- No suicidal ideation - ""wants to live more""
- No substance use
- No medical problems or allergies

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

The presentation strongly suggests Separation Anxiety Disorder (F93.0):
- Excessive anxiety concerning separation from attachment figure (mother)
- Persistent worry about harm befalling attachment figure
- Reluctance to go to school due to fear of separation
- Nightmares involving theme of separation
- Duration > 4 weeks (7 months)
- Clinically significant impairment (school performance, social relationships)
- Clear precipitant (death of friend's mother)

However, there are also features suggestive of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1):
- Racing thoughts
- Difficulty concentrating
- Sleep disturbance
- The description ""his mind does not shut off"" and ""racing thoughts of whatever and however bad situation might be"" suggests excessive worry


- Meets duration criteria (>6 months), though the worry content appears primarily centered on separation from mother rather than multiple life domains

The differential diagnosis centers on whether this is primarily a separation-focused anxiety or a more generalized pattern. The core anxiety themes—distress upon separation, catastrophic thoughts about harm to his mother, and avoidance of school—all point toward separation anxiety as the primary diagnosis, with some comorbid features of generalized anxiety that may warrant monitoring. is the most fitting given the specific anxiety centered on separation from mother, fear of harm coming to her, nightmares about being apart, and reluctance to leave her side. Generalized Anxiety Disorder also fits with the racing thoughts and difficulty controlling worry.

Social Anxiety Disorder could explain the withdrawal and loneliness at school, though that doesn't seem to be the primary driver. If criteria aren't fully met for a specific disorder, Unspecified Anxiety Disorder would be appropriate.

- Concerned about safety and people being out to get her

Workup findings:
- Basic labs (CBC, CMP, UDS, UA, thyroid, B12, folate, HIV, syphilis) - unremarkable
- Started on low-dose Seroquel → worsened psychotic symptoms + acute dystonic reaction
- CT Head - unremarkable
- Developed seizure
- EEG shows epileptiform discharges
- CT A/P revealed suspected ovarian teratoma, confirmed with ultrasound
- LP with CSF anti-NMDA antibody positive
- Diagnosis: Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis

This is a classic presentation of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis:
1. Young female
2. Acute onset psychiatric symptoms (psychosis, paranoia)
3. Ovarian teratoma (associated with anti-NMDA encephalitis)
4. Positive anti-NMDA antibodies in CSF
5. Seizures
6. Movement abnormalities (dystonia, though this was antipsychotic-induced)
7. Severe sensitivity to antipsychotics (paradoxical worsening)

The diagnosis here is clearly an organic/medical condition causing the psychiatric symptoms - specifically anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.

In DSM-5-TR terms, this would be classified as:

Primary diagnosis: 
- Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis)


- With delusions and hallucinations

For ICD-10 coding, since she presents with both delusions and hallucinations but the paranoid delusions are more prominent, F06.2 (psychotic disorder due to known physiological condition with delusions) would be the most appropriate code.

Other diagnoses considered in the differential include catatonia due to another medical condition given the severity, delirium due to another medical condition given the acute fluctuating presentation, and brief psychotic disorder before the underlying medical etiology was identified. However, since anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis with positive antibodies and an ovarian teratoma have been confirmed as the organic cause, the primary diagnosis is psychotic disorder due to another medical condition, coded as F06.2 with delusions. Ovarian teratoma confirms this is an organic etiology. The primary diagnosis should be Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition - F06.2 given the prominent persecutory delusions, though F06.0 could apply if hallucinations were the predominant feature. The differential would have included Delirium due to another medical condition (F05) given the acute onset and seizure activity, Brief Psychotic Disorder (F23) based on the symptom duration, and Hallucination-predominant presentation (F06.0) before the underlying cause was identified. leptiform discharges on EEG. The movement disorder component (dystonia) may be medication-related rather than primary to the encephalitis. Given that the question specifically asks for psychiatric diagnoses with F-codes and the presentation centers on psychotic symptoms, I should prioritize those diagnoses while acknowledging the organic etiology. F06.2 (Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition, with delusions) and F06.0 (with hallucinations) both apply to this case, though listing both feels redundant since they describe the same underlying condition with different symptom presentations. F05 (Delirium Due to Another Medical Condition) is also relevant given the acute onset, disorganized thinking, and global cerebral dysfunction. I'll consolidate to avoid duplication while capturing the key diagnostic picture. that anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis frequently presents with anxiety and mood disturbances alongside the psychotic features. The differential should focus on diagnoses that fit the acute 2-day timeline. Schizophreniform disorder requires at least a month of symptoms, so that's ruled out. The most likely diagnoses are Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (F06.2) given the identified organic etiology, Delirium Due to Another Medical Condition (F05) accounting for the acute disorganization, and Brief Psychotic Disorder (F23) as a consideration before the medical cause was established. ological condition

My final differential includes: Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition with delusions (F06.2) as primary, Delirium Due to Another Medical Condition (F05), Brief Psychotic Disorder (F23), Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition with hallucinations (F06.0), and Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder (F29) as alternatives given the diagnostic uncertainty around the underlying etiology and presentation timeline.","1.

Timeline:
- Symptoms began 1 month ago with cancer diagnosis
- No prior history of depression
- Anxiety history was in law school (distant past), well-controlled since

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

1. **Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood (F43.23)**
This is the most likely primary diagnosis because:
- Clear identifiable stressor: new cancer diagnosis 1 month ago
- Symptoms developed in response to this stressor
- Emotional symptoms (depression, anxiety/worry) that are out of proportion to what might be expected
- No prior history of depression
- Duration is within 3 months of stressor onset


- The distress is substantial, with both depressive features (depressed mood, anhedonia, hopelessness) and anxiety features (persistent worry about cancer, family, finances) present simultaneously.

2. **Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode** 
Could be considered but:
- The direct temporal relationship with the stressor makes adjustment disorder more fitting
- While he meets symptom criteria (depressed mood, anhedonia, low energy, appetite changes, hopelessness), the clear reactive nature and absence of prior MDD history favor the adjustment disorder diagnosis initially

3. **Generalized Anxiety Disorder**
Less likely as the primary diagnosis since depressive symptoms are more prominent than anxiety symptoms, though worry is a significant component of his presentation.

4. **Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition**
Cancer could be contributing to anxiety, but his symptoms appear more psychologically reactive than medically driven.

5. **Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition**
While cancer and diabetes might contribute, the psychological response to the diagnosis seems to be the primary driver.

6. **Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions**
His emotional state may be impacting his medical treatment and recovery.

The most likely diagnosis appears to be adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct, given the clear stressor, symptom onset within one month, and the combination of depressive and anxiety features that are directly tied to the cancer diagnosis. - If the depressive presentation doesn't fit neatly into other categories

5. **Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions (F54)** - The psychological distress could be impacting his cancer treatment adherence and recovery.

Looking more carefully at the symptom count: depressed mood, anhedonia, hopelessness, low energy, and decreased appetite are all present. That's five depressive symptoms meeting duration criteria (one month), which technically satisfies MDD thresholds. However, the clear temporal relationship to the cancer diagnosis and absence of prior depressive episodes make adjustment disorder the more appropriate primary diagnosis, with MDD as a differential if the symptoms persist beyond the expected adjustment period. Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Unspecified Anxiety Disorder are possibilities given the worry component, though the clear precipitant and time-limited nature make adjustment disorder more likely. Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions could apply given the cancer diagnosis. I should also weigh Illness Anxiety Disorder, but his concerns are grounded in reality since he actually has cancer. Somatic Symptom Disorder lacks supporting evidence. Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition is worth considering given his cancer and diabetes, though the reactive presentation to the diagnosis itself points more toward adjustment pathology. There's no indication of psychosis, manic episodes, substance involvement, or trauma-specific symptoms that would suggest other major diagnostic categories. This narrows the differential considerably. The worry about cancer recurrence and health outcomes is understandable given his situation, though it does seem excessive. I'm settling on a primary diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood as the best fit since his symptoms are clearly tied to the cancer diagnosis. I'd also consider Major Depressive Disorder if the depressive symptoms are more prominent than the adjustment suggests, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder given his pattern of anxiety issues and current excessive worry. Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions is relevant since his mental state could impact how he manages his cancer treatment. I should also evaluate whether a diagnosis related to his medical conditions—like depressive or anxiety disorder due to cancer or diabetes—might be more appropriate than a primary psychiatric diagnosis.","1.

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

This case presents with a classic picture of schizophrenia:

1. **Duration**: Symptoms present for 2 years total, with clear psychotic symptoms for at least 6 months
2. **Characteristic symptoms**: 
   - Hallucinations (auditory - hearing voices)
   - Disorganized speech and thought process
   - Negative symptoms including social isolation, blunted affect, and self-neglect
3. **Functional decline**: Lost job, marked decrease from previous functioning
4. **Age of onset**: Typical for schizophrenia (early 20s in males)
5. **Family history**: Second-degree relative with schizophrenia, which increases risk
6. **Exclusion of other causes**: Medical workup negative

**DSM-5-TR Criteria for Schizophrenia:**

A. Two or more of the following for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period (or less if successfully treated):
- Delusions
- Hallucinations
- Disorganized speech
- Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior
- Negative symptoms (diminished emotional expression or avolition)

This patient clearly meets criterion A with auditory hallucinations, disorganized speech, and prominent negative symptoms. The 2-year prodromal phase followed by 6+ months of active psychosis satisfies the duration requirement. His rapid response to antipsychotic medication—with reduction in hallucination intensity and improved engagement—further supports the diagnosis, as schizophrenia typically shows responsiveness to dopamine antagonists. The differential diagnosis centers on schizophrenia as the primary diagnosis given the classic presentation with prodromal period, positive and negative symptoms, functional decline over more than 6 months, family history, and appropriate age of onset with medical causes ruled out. Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder is considered but less likely as the primary diagnosis because the 2-year chronic course with prominent negative symptoms and typical schizophrenia prodrome suggests an underlying primary psychotic disorder rather than substance-induced; cannabis use may be comorbid or represent self-medication. Cannabis use disorder should also be documented as likely comorbid given the positive urine drug screen, though additional information about usage patterns would help clarify the extent of this disorder.

Schizoaffective disorder warrants consideration since family members noted depressed mood, but without a clearly documented major mood episode and with psychotic symptoms predominating, schizophrenia remains the better fit. Schizophreniform disorder and brief psychotic disorder are ruled out based on the duration exceeding 6 months. Major depressive disorder with psychotic features is less likely since the presentation is primarily psychotic rather than mood-driven, and what appears as depression may reflect negative symptoms rather than a true depressive episode. course and presentation more consistent with primary psychotic disorder. The diagnostic codes need clarification—schizophrenia would be F20.9 under DSM-5 nomenclature since subtypes are no longer used. Cannabis use disorder severity depends on whether full criteria are met: F12.10 for mild, F12.20 for moderate to severe, or F12.90 if only use is documented. Schizoaffective disorder depressive type is F25.1, major depressive disorder with psychotic features is F32.3, and cannabis-induced psychotic disorder would be F12.951 or F12.959 depending on severity level.

The positive urine drug screen confirms cannabis use, but the documentation doesn't clearly establish whether full use disorder criteria are satisfied or just substance use alone. Given the evidence of psychotic symptoms persisting beyond six months, unspecified schizophrenia spectrum disorder (F29) seems less appropriate than the primary diagnoses. The most defensible approach prioritizes the longitudinal psychotic presentation while acknowledging the cannabis exposure without overstating the severity of substance-related pathology.","1.

Trauma History:
- Sexual abuse at young age by biological father (now in prison)

Substance Use:
- UDS positive for marijuana
- Admits to smoking marijuana daily for 1 year

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

1. **Conduct Disorder (F91.1 or F91.2)** - This is strongly supported by:
- Aggression to people (assaulted mother, assaulted student)
- Aggression to animals (hits household dog ""too hard"")
- Deceitfulness or theft - not explicitly mentioned
- Serious violations of rules (truancy, running away from home)
- Age of onset: Some behaviors started at age 9, assault charges starting at age 14


- The pattern appears persistent and ongoing, with childhood-onset features (irritability and explosive outbursts beginning at age 9) suggesting F91.1 rather than adolescent-onset type.

2. **Oppositional Defiant Disorder (F91.3)** - Already diagnosed
- Pattern of angry/irritable mood
- Argumentative/defiant behavior
- Problems with authority figures
- However, given the progression to conduct disorder, this may be superseded

3. **Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (F34.81)** - Already diagnosed
- Severe temper outbursts
- Persistent irritability
- Onset before age 10 (started at age 9)
- However, need to consider if Conduct Disorder better explains the presentation

4. **Cannabis Use Disorder (F12.XX)** - Clearly supported by daily use for 1 year and positive UDS, likely moderate or severe given the frequency.

5. **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (F43.10)** - History of childhood sexual abuse warrants consideration, though current symptom presentation isn't fully detailed to confirm diagnostic criteria.

6. **Unspecified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder (F43.9)** - May be more appropriate if trauma-related symptoms are present but don't meet full PTSD threshold.

The primary diagnostic focus should be on Conduct Disorder, Childhood-onset type, as the most likely primary diagnosis given the escalating behavioral pattern and age of onset, with cannabis use disorder as a significant secondary concern requiring intervention. The DSM-5-TR hierarchy complicates this picture—DMDD shouldn't be diagnosed if mood symptoms are solely contextual to conduct problems or occur only during a mood episode. However, the persistent irritability here seems to extend beyond what conduct disorder alone explains. While CD takes precedence when criteria are met, DMDD can still be diagnosed comorbidly if the chronic irritability and severe outbursts are genuinely independent features rather than just reactive to rule violations. The key distinction is whether the mood dysregulation exists as its own pathological process or merely as a consequence of behavioral problems.

Given the clinical presentation, conduct disorder emerges as the primary diagnosis—the assault, animal cruelty, running away, and truancy represent serious violations of others' rights and social norms that define CD. The childhood onset around age 9 and apparent callous-unemotional traits (limited remorse) further support this. Cannabis use disorder also warrants documentation as a secondary concern. Trauma exposure is noted in the history, though current PTSD symptoms aren't sufficiently detailed to confirm that diagnosis.

Since conduct disorder is present, oppositional defiant disorder shouldn't be coded separately—CD encompasses the oppositional features. However, DMDD can coexist if the irritability and mood dysregulation are severe and persistent enough to warrant independent clinical attention beyond what CD alone explains. The prior DMDD diagnosis and ongoing explosive outbursts suggest this comorbidity may be appropriate.

For the revised diagnostic picture: conduct disorder with limited prosocial emotions is primary, with cannabis use disorder as secondary. DMDD remains relevant given the persistent irritability since childhood. A trauma-related disorder should be considered given the documented trauma history. Intermittent explosive disorder would be ruled out since the aggression is better accounted for by the conduct disorder diagnosis. I'm also considering whether ADHD might be present but don't have sufficient information to determine this at this point.

The limited prosocial emotions specifier fits here—there's evidence of minimal remorse (dismissive comments about consequences), apparent indifference to others' distress (hitting the dog excessively, siblings' fear), possible academic disengagement through truancy, though affect presentation isn't clearly documented. With at least two of these features present over the required timeframe, this specifier applies. The childhood-onset type is indicated given the behavioral pattern's early emergence.

Beyond Conduct Disorder, several comorbid conditions warrant consideration. Cannabis use appears moderate in severity. Mood dysregulation is evident, suggesting DMDD. The trauma history and current stressors point toward a trauma-related diagnosis, though PTSD criteria may not be fully met, making an unspecified trauma-stressor disorder more appropriate. ADHD could be present but lacks sufficient documentation. Attachment issues are possible given early abuse, yet the data doesn't clearly support Reactive Attachment Disorder. Depressive symptoms are insufficient for a specific mood diagnosis.

The final diagnostic picture centers on Conduct Disorder as the primary diagnosis, with Cannabis Use Disorder, Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, and Unspecified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder as secondary conditions. Since DSM-5-TR specifies that ODD should not be diagnosed when Conduct Disorder is present, I need to exclude it from the list.

Given the documented sexual abuse history, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder is more clinically relevant than ADHD, which lacks clear descriptive evidence. The cannabis use pattern—daily consumption over a year—supports a moderate severity rating. The ICD-10 coding reflects this: F12.20 for moderate use disorder, F43.10 for the trauma-related condition, and F91.1 for childhood-onset conduct problems.

Reconsidering the diagnostic picture, the unspecified trauma disorder already captures the stressor-related component, making a separate PTSD diagnosis redundant. Other possibilities like Intermittent Explosive Disorder are subsumed under the conduct disorder diagnosis, and Antisocial Personality Disorder cannot be applied before age 18. For the fifth diagnosis, I'm weighing whether to include a specific trauma-focused condition or explore alternative presentations that better fit the clinical presentation.

Looking at the prior diagnostic history alongside the new behavioral information—the assault, animal cruelty, and running away—this warrants upgrading to Conduct Disorder. The DSM-5-TR permits DMDD to coexist with Conduct Disorder, so both can remain on the differential. The childhood-onset type applies given the early emergence of these behaviors.

For the substance use, daily cannabis consumption suggests moderate severity. The significant trauma history, particularly sexual abuse, points toward a trauma-related disorder, though specific PTSD criteria may not be fully met, so an unspecified trauma-related diagnosis captures this. ADHD is a common comorbidity with conduct problems and should be considered given the behavioral presentation. .1) - PRIMARY
2. Cannabis Use Disorder, Moderate (F12.20) 
3. Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (F34.81)
4. Unspecified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder (F43.9)
5. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (F43.10)

I notice having both trauma-related diagnoses creates overlap. F43.10 specifies PTSD without clarifying acute versus chronic presentation, while F43.9 applies when full PTSD criteria aren't satisfied but significant stress response is present. Since the clinical picture doesn't clearly meet complete PTSD criteria, F43.9 seems more appropriate here.

For the fifth diagnosis, ADHD unspecified type could fit given its frequent co-occurrence with conduct and disruptive behavior disorders, though the evidence isn't strong enough to confidently include it. I should consider whether there's sufficient support for this diagnosis or explore other options.

ODD was noted historically but shouldn't be diagnosed alongside CD. Intermittent Explosive Disorder is ruled out by the presence of CD. The irritability the mother describes is already captured by DMDD. While antisocial personality disorder features might be present, formal diagnosis isn't appropriate at age 16. An unspecified anxiety disorder could be a reasonable fifth diagnosis given the clinical picture, though the presentation doesn't strongly emphasize anxiety symptoms.

The clearest diagnoses remain conduct disorder, cannabis use disorder, DMDD reflecting the chronic irritability and explosive episodes, and the documented trauma history. A fifth code would need to address either anxiety symptoms or other clinical features not yet captured by the primary diagnoses. The trauma history makes PTSD worth considering, though explicit re-experiencing or avoidance symptoms aren't documented. For the fifth diagnosis, I'm weighing unspecified anxiety disorder against adjustment disorder or a trauma-related condition.

Looking at the clinical picture more carefully—the documented abuse, behavioral dysregulation, and substance use—I should prioritize what's most defensible diagnostically. Conduct Disorder remains primary, with Cannabis Use Disorder and mood dysregulation as clear secondary diagnoses. The trauma exposure suggests including an unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder rather than speculating about PTSD without full symptom criteria. ODD wouldn't be appropriate since Conduct Disorder supersedes it diagnostically. So my working list focuses on the most evident presentations: the conduct problems, substance use, mood instability, and trauma-related symptoms, with the fifth diagnosis capturing what remains clinically significant from the presentation. ) - PRIMARY diagnosis given the severity and pervasiveness of conduct violations. Cannabis Use Disorder is moderate, supported by regular use and functional impairment. DMDD remains relevant given the mood dysregulation component. The trauma history warrants documentation as an unspecified trauma-related disorder, though PTSD could also apply depending on symptom specificity. I'm settling on the five diagnoses that best capture the clinical presentation without overreaching into speculative territory.","1. Conduct Disorder, Childhood-onset type - F91.1

- Depression screening positive

Current Depressive Symptoms (present for ~3 weeks, most of the day, nearly every day):
- Depressed mood
- Anhedonia
- Hopelessness
- Low energy
- Difficulty concentrating
- Feelings of guilt/worthlessness

Prior to these 3 weeks: mood was ""normal""

Past Mood Episode (~1 month ago, lasting ~5 days):
- ""Extremely happy"" - elevated mood
- Felt ""the complete opposite"" of current depressed state
- Increased productivity (cleaned entire house in an evening)
- Took on more projects at work
- Increased energy
- Decreased need for sleep (only 2-3 hours/night and felt ""amazing"")

Medication History:
- Tried Zoloft in the past
- Discontinued because it made her feel ""hyper"" (possible antidepressant-induced mood elevation)
- Currently not on psychiatric medication

Hospitalization History:
- Never psychiatrically hospitalized

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

The key features here are:
1. Current depressive episode meeting criteria (multiple symptoms for 3 weeks)
2. Past episode of elevated mood lasting 5 days with:
   - Elevated/expansive mood
   - Decreased need for sleep
   - Increased goal-directed activity
   - Increased energy

For Bipolar I Disorder:
- Manic episode requires: distinct period of abnormally elevated, expansive, or irritable mood AND increased energy/activity lasting at least 7 days (or any duration if hospitalization required)
- Plus 3+ additional symptoms (4 if mood is only irritable)

For Bipolar II Disorder:
- Hypomanic episode requires: same mood criteria but lasting at least 4 consecutive days


- Plus 3+ additional symptoms, with noticeable functional change but no marked impairment or need for hospitalization
- Must have at least one major depressive episode

The elevated mood episode lasted 5 days—exceeding the 4-day minimum for hypomania but falling short of the 7-day requirement for mania. She demonstrated clear functional changes (productivity surge, taking on additional work) without requiring hospitalization. The current depressive episode spans 3 weeks with multiple neurovegetative and cognitive symptoms, clearly meeting major depressive episode criteria.

The combination of a documented hypomanic episode and current major depression points directly to Bipolar II Disorder. Her response to Zoloft—feeling ""hyper""—aligns with how antidepressants can unmask underlying bipolar vulnerability. The earlier history of anxiety and depression likely represents prior depressive phases rather than primary anxiety disorder.

Bipolar I would require a full manic episode lasting at least 7 days, which doesn't fit her 5-day elevated period. Major Depressive Disorder remains a consideration given her current symptoms, but the hypomanic episode essentially excludes it as the primary diagnosis. Cyclothymia requires a 2+ year pattern of mood fluctuations that isn't evident here, and her depressive symptoms appear to meet full criteria for a major episode rather than the milder dysthymia pattern cyclothymia involves.

Anxiety could be present as a comorbid condition given her history, though it's not the primary focus of the current presentation. The most likely diagnosis appears to be Bipolar II Disorder, characterized by the hypomanic episode followed by the current depressive episode—with F31.81 being the appropriate ICD-10 code for this condition. ) - Less likely given insufficient duration and the presence of a full major depressive episode that would exclude this diagnosis.

The moderate severity specifier for Major Depressive Disorder (F33.1) aligns with the functional impairment described. For Bipolar I with current depressive episode, the moderate severity code (F31.32) fits better than mild or severe. The differential includes Bipolar II Disorder (F31.81) as primary given the 5-day hypomanic episode, with Bipolar I (F31.32) and recurrent Major Depressive Disorder (F33.1) as secondary considerations depending on whether the hypomanic episode fully meets duration criteria. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1) should be documented as a comorbid condition given the anxiety history. likely comorbid with the mood disorder. Bipolar I Disorder could apply if the elevated mood was more severe, though the current presentation fits Bipolar II better. Unspecified Bipolar and Related Disorder serves as a fallback if the hypomanic episode doesn't fully meet criteria or the presentation is atypical. Overall, Bipolar II Disorder emerges as the most defensible primary diagnosis given the documented hypomanic episode combined with the current depressive state.","1. Bipolar II Disorder - F31.81

1047,"Patient F is a 37 year old male with past medical history of hypertension and past psychiatric history of substance use disorder (marijuana, methamphetamine) and psychosis who presents after being brought in by police to the ED for aggression. The patient was reportedly at a gas station causing a disturbance, speaking about how everyone in there was the devil and throwing items off the shelves. When officers arrived, the patient was aggressive and had to be tased. On arrival, the patient had to receive emergency IM medications of Haldol, Ativan, and Benadryl due to agitation. Psychiatry was consulted for psychosis. On psychiatric assessment, the patient is drowsy after having just received the emergency IM medications. However, he is irritable and hostile, telling the physician to “fuck off” and that “the devil is out to get you”. He states he is “like a God” and that he was unfairly arrested. On chart review, he has a history of being prescribed antipsychotics, but currently pt denies taking any psychiatric medications. Assessment was limited due to the patient’s lack of engagement and hostility. Lab work was significant for UDS positive for marijuana, methamphetamine, and PCP. He started on a low-dose of scheduled Risperidone. The next day, he was reassessed by psychiatry. He is less hostile, but still irritable and asks if he can sleep. On limited assessment, pt denied thinking the devil was after him and did not make any grandiose statements about him being God. He did not appear internally preoccupied but was very sleepy. He was later assessed in the afternoon after he was repotedly asking to leave. He denied suicidal ideations, homicidal ideations, or auditory/visual hallucinations. While he was still irritable, he was more cooperative and states he does not recall being at a gas station. He does endorse to using marijuana, methamphetamine, and PCP “for 2 days straight”. He is currently homeless and wants to go to the shelter. He denies paranoia or any belief that he is God, states “that’s ridiculous” when asked that question.

Key clinical information:
1. Demographics: 37-year-old male
2. Past medical history: Hypertension
3. Past psychiatric history: Substance use disorder (marijuana, methamphetamine) and psychosis
4. Presenting problem: Aggression at gas station, paranoid delusions (everyone is the devil), disorganized behavior (throwing items)
5. Required emergency medications (Haldol, Ativan, Benadryl) for agitation
6. Mental status on initial assessment: Drowsy, irritable, hostile, paranoid delusions (""devil is out to get you""), grandiose delusions (""like a God"")
7. History of being prescribed antipsychotics but currently not taking any
8. UDS positive for: marijuana, methamphetamine, and PCP
9. Patient admits to using marijuana, methamphetamine, and PCP ""for 2 days straight""
10. Social: Currently homeless
11. Follow-up assessment (next day): Less hostile, still irritable, denied paranoia and grandiose beliefs, no longer appeared internally preoccupied
12. Later assessment: Denied SI/HI/AH/VH, more cooperative, no recall of gas station incident, denies paranoia
13. Discharged after 24 hours in ED

Key observations for differential diagnosis:

The psychotic symptoms (paranoid delusions about the devil, grandiose delusions about being God, behavioral disorganization, aggression) occurred in the context of:
- Recent heavy polysubstance use (marijuana, methamphetamine, and PCP for 2 days straight)
- All three substances detected on UDS

The psychotic symptoms resolved relatively quickly (within 24 hours) after:
- Cessation of substance use
- Brief antipsychotic treatment
- Time for substances to clear

This pattern strongly suggests substance-induced psychotic disorder rather than a primary psychotic disorder. The rapid resolution of symptoms is more consistent with substance-induced psychosis.


PCP is particularly notable for producing aggressive behavior, paranoid and grandiose delusions, and amnesia for events during intoxication—all of which this patient exhibited. Methamphetamine similarly causes paranoid psychosis and aggression. While he has a prior psychiatric history, the absence of current antipsychotic adherence combined with active polysubstance use makes substance-induced psychosis the most likely diagnosis.

The primary consideration is phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder, given the positive UDS, recent use acknowledgment, and textbook presentation of PCP effects including the aggressive outbursts, paranoid ideation, and memory gaps. Methamphetamine-induced psychotic disorder is also highly probable given the positive screen and reported 2-day binge, as stimulants reliably trigger paranoid psychosis. Cannabis may be contributing as well given its presence on the drug screen, though it's less likely to be the primary driver of this acute presentation.

I should also consider whether an underlying schizophrenia spectrum disorder exists, particularly given the history of prior psychotic episodes and antipsychotic prescriptions, but the rapid symptom resolution once the patient achieves sobriety strongly suggests substance-induced rather than primary psychotic illness. Both methamphetamine and phencyclidine use disorders are clearly present based on the active use patterns and binge consumption. The severity of the use disorders appears substantial given the acute psychotic crisis and behavioral dyscontrol. PCP's strong psychotomimetic properties and the clinical presentation—aggression, paranoia, grandiosity, memory gaps—align well with PCP intoxication. Combined with methamphetamine use, these substances would amplify psychotic symptoms.

The primary diagnosis should be phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder given the acute onset and rapid resolution pattern. Stimulant-induced psychotic disorder also warrants diagnosis due to documented methamphetamine use and positive screening. Additionally, moderate use disorder diagnoses for PCP, methamphetamine, and cannabis reflect the pattern of continued use despite negative consequences. d Psychotic Disorder as the primary diagnosis given the acute presentation with hallucinations and delusions. Amphetamine-induced psychosis is also plausible given the methamphetamine history. For substance use disorders, the patient has established diagnoses with marijuana and methamphetamine, and the new PCP use appears to meet criteria for at least moderate severity.

I need to consider the coding approach carefully—when both a substance use disorder and substance-induced psychotic disorder are present from the same substance, I should code both, as they represent different clinical aspects of the presentation. hetamine-type, Moderate** - F15.20
5. **Cannabis Use Disorder, Moderate** - F12.20

The key question is whether this represents primary psychosis exacerbated by substances or purely substance-induced symptoms. The rapid resolution within 24 hours of clearing the drugs, denial of beliefs when sober, and classic presentation during acute intoxication all point toward substance-induced rather than a primary psychotic disorder. An unspecified psychotic disorder should still be considered given the prior antipsychotic treatment history.

My final diagnostic formulation includes the substance-induced psychotic disorders for both PCP and methamphetamine, along with the moderate use disorders for all three substances. I need to verify the correct F-codes for phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder to ensure accuracy—F16.150 for mild use disorder, F16.250 for moderate-severe, and F16.950 when no use disorder is present or unspecified. For phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder, the appropriate codes depend on the severity of concurrent use disorder. F16.14 applies when there's mild use disorder with delusions, while F16.24 covers moderate or severe use disorder with delusions. For amphetamine-type stimulants, F15.14 and F15.24 follow the same pattern, with F15.94 used when no use disorder is present. Since this patient has documented methamphetamine use disorder, I should apply the moderate use disorder codes. The primary diagnosis would be phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder with delusions, coded as F16.24 given the moderate use disorder severity, alongside amphetamine-type stimulant-induced psychotic disorder (F15.24), and the corresponding use disorder codes for both substances and cannabis (F16.20, F15.20, F12.20). However, I'm second-guessing whether I'm overcomplicating the coding approach—the unspecified severity codes like F16.959 might be more appropriate if there isn't sufficient documentation to confirm the exact severity level of PCP use specifically. likely caused by PCP and methamphetamine based on the clinical presentation and timeline. The psychotic symptoms are the acute manifestation, while the underlying use disorders represent the chronic conditions contributing to this episode. I'm coding the substance-induced psychotic disorders separately from the use disorders for comprehensive clinical documentation—PCP-induced psychotic disorder and amphetamine-induced psychotic disorder as the primary diagnoses, with moderate use disorder codes for each substance and cannabis use disorder also documented.","1.

**Data Extraction and Organization:**

Demographics:
- 29-year-old male
- No past medical or psychiatric history
- Veteran, discharged from military 1 year ago
- Combat-related injury in Afghanistan

Presenting complaint: Problems with sleep

Timeline: Symptoms began after returning from deployment (1 year ago)

Symptom clusters identified:

1. Intrusion symptoms:
- Recurring nightmares of what he witnessed in Afghanistan
- Memories triggered by loud noises (fireworks)

2. Avoidance symptoms:
- Avoids loud noises such as fireworks (external reminders)

3. Negative alterations in cognitions and mood:
- Persistent negative beliefs about self (""I'm a horrible person"")
- Persistent negative emotional state (anger - ""always angry"")
- Feelings of guilt/regret (""regrets what he did"")

4. Alterations in arousal and reactivity:
- Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep)
- Hypervigilance (always feels like he has to be aware of surroundings)
- Irritable behavior/angry outbursts (mood has been ""mad,"" ""always angry,"" causing difficulties with wife)

5. Substance use:
- Tobacco: 1 pack per day
- Alcohol: 6 beers daily, started since returning from active duty
- ""Never misses a day""
- Uses it to cope (""the only thing that helps me"")
- Denies illicit substances

6. Functional impairment:
- Marital difficulties
- Sleep impairment

Traumatic event: Combat-related (witnessed traumatic events, involved in actions he regrets)

Duration: >1 year (since discharge)

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

**Primary Diagnosis: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) - F43.10**

This patient clearly meets DSM-5-TR criteria for PTSD:


- Direct combat exposure satisfies Criterion A
- Recurrent nightmares and triggered distress from loud noises fulfill Criterion B
- Active avoidance of noise-related triggers meets Criterion C
- Negative self-perception and persistent anger address Criterion D
- Sleep problems, heightened vigilance, and explosive anger satisfy Criterion E
- Symptom duration exceeds one month, meeting Criterion F
- Impairment evident in relationship strain and sleep disruption satisfies Criterion G
- Medical and substance causes ruled out given the clear temporal link between combat trauma and symptom onset

For secondary diagnoses, alcohol appears to be a significant concern—daily consumption of six beers represents heavy use that began as a trauma response. The pattern suggests dependence with tolerance development, compulsive use despite consequences, and reliance on alcohol as the primary coping mechanism. Tobacco use at one pack daily also warrants consideration as a separate disorder.

Insomnia presents as a symptom cluster within the PTSD presentation rather than an independent condition, given its direct connection to nightmares and hyperarousal. Depressive symptoms are present but seem secondary to the trauma response—would need clarification on core features like anhedonia and suicidal thinking to determine if major depression is comorbid or better explained by PTSD alone.

The most defensible diagnostic picture centers on PTSD as the primary condition, with alcohol and tobacco use disorders as significant comorbidities requiring intervention.

For alcohol use disorder specifically, the daily consumption of six beers combined with the pattern of use as a coping mechanism suggests moderate to severe severity—likely meeting at least four to five diagnostic criteria including tolerance, continued use despite consequences, and craving. Insomnia appears secondary to the PTSD rather than a standalone disorder, though it remains clinically significant and warrants monitoring. Major depressive disorder is less likely given that the mood symptoms align more directly with trauma response than a primary depressive episode. Alcohol Use Disorder, Moderate - F10.20
3. Tobacco Use Disorder - F17.200
4. Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Unspecified - F32.9
5. Insomnia Disorder - F51.01

I should reconsider the MDD diagnosis though. The presentation includes anger and guilt, which align with PTSD's negative emotional state and self-blame rather than classic depressive symptoms. There's no clear depressed mood (he describes feeling ""mad"" rather than sad), no anhedonia mentioned, and no appetite changes noted. These features might be better explained by the trauma response itself.

For the substance use codes, F17.200 correctly captures nicotine dependence, and F10.20 is appropriate for the alcohol use severity. Given the incomplete depressive symptom picture, unspecified depressive disorder (F32.A) may be more accurate than a full MDD diagnosis, though including it in the differential makes clinical sense.

Adjustment disorder with mixed features wouldn't apply here since PTSD takes precedence when trauma criteria are met. Other anxiety presentations like generalized anxiety or panic disorder aren't supported by the clinical picture—the hypervigilance and anxiety symptoms are better accounted for by the PTSD diagnosis. While combat injury was mentioned, there's no evidence of cognitive impairment to suggest TBI-related conditions.

The final diagnostic list includes PTSD as the primary condition, moderate alcohol use disorder, tobacco use disorder, unspecified depressive disorder, and insomnia disorder.","1. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder - F43.10

**Data Extraction and Organization:**

Demographics:
- 36-year-old female
- Previously functioning well (full-time accountant, married with 2 children)

Psychiatric History:
- Major Depressive Disorder diagnosed at age 20
- On Zoloft (sertraline) for years
- Lost insurance 6 months ago, off medications for 6 months

Presenting Problem:
- Bizarre behavior noticed by mother
- Not eating
- Staring blankly at walls
- Not attending to hygiene

Mental Status Examination:
- Mute (mutism)
- Poor hygiene
- Facial grimacing during interview
- Sits motionless (immobility/stupor)
- Does not answer questions
- Stares blankly
- Unable to engage
- Does not follow simple commands (when asked to stick tongue out)
- Waxy flexibility (arm moved above head, stays there after psychiatrist lets go)
- Gegenhalten (large amount of resistance that slowly decreases with time when arm is moved)

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

The clinical picture strongly suggests CATATONIA. Key catatonic features present:
1. Mutism - present
2. Stupor (immobility) - sits motionless
3. Waxy flexibility (catalepsy) - arm stays in position after being placed there
4. Gegenhalten - resistance to movement that slowly decreases
5. Mannerism/grimacing - face scrunching
6. Negativism - not following commands (possibly)
7. Staring

For catatonia diagnosis, typically 3 or more of the following 12 symptoms are needed:
1. Stupor - YES
2. Catalepsy (waxy flexibility) - YES
3. Waxy flexibility - YES
4. Mutism - YES
5. Negativism - possibly (not following commands)
6. Posturing - arm left overhead


7. Mannerism - facial scrunching/grimacing - YES
8. Stereotypy - not clearly described
9. Agitation - NO
10. Grimacing - YES (face scrunching)
11. Echolalia - cannot assess due to mutism
12. Echopraxia - not described

This patient clearly meets criteria with at least 5-6 distinct catatonic signs present.

**Determining the Underlying Etiology:**

The key question is what's driving the catatonia. Given her history of MDD, medication discontinuation 6 months ago, and previously stable functioning, I need to consider whether this represents catatonic depression, or if there's another primary cause. The absence of documented psychotic features and no mention of medical conditions makes psychiatric causes most likely, with catatonic depression being the leading diagnosis given her MDD history and medication lapse.

For DSM-5-TR coding, catatonia associated with a mental disorder like depression uses the catatonia specifier applied to the mood disorder diagnosis, coded as 293.89 (F06.1) in addition to the primary diagnosis.

The primary diagnosis would be Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Severe (F33.2 or F33.3 if psychotic features are present), with the catatonic features noted through the additional F06.1 code. The clinical picture—prolonged medication discontinuation, acute severe functional decline, and motor symptoms—points toward a depressive episode with catatonic presentation rather than a primary catatonic disorder.

Other possibilities warrant consideration but seem less likely. Schizophrenia with catatonia (F20.2) is less probable given the established history of depression without prior psychotic episodes and previously intact functioning. Brief Psychotic Disorder (F23) is also less consistent with the timeline and presentation. The catatonia code F06.1 captures the motor manifestations themselves, whether they're secondary to the mood disorder or another underlying condition. The underlying condition is Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Severe (F33.2). While schizophrenia catatonic type and schizoaffective disorder with depressive features remain differential considerations, they're less supported by the clinical picture. The catatonic presentation is most parsimoniously explained as a severe depressive episode, particularly given the patient's psychiatric history and recent medication discontinuation. Schizophreniform and brief psychotic disorders are less likely given the timeline and symptom pattern. The catatonic presentation is unmistakable—mutism, stupor, waxy flexibility, gegenhalten, grimacing—so the coding approach needs to reflect this. In DSM-5-TR, catatonia occurring with another mental disorder gets coded as the underlying condition plus the catatonia specifier. So the primary diagnoses are:

1. **Catatonia associated with Major Depressive Disorder** - F06.1, given this is the most acute clinical presentation
2. **Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent Episode, Severe** - F33.2, as the foundational condition
3. **Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder** - F29, to account for psychotic features that could suggest an alternative etiology
4. **Schizophrenia, catatonic type** - F20.2, as a differential given the catatonic symptoms
5. **Schizoaffective Disorder, Depressive Type** - F25.1, another possibility given the mood and psychotic overlap
6. **Brief Psychotic Disorder** - F23, to consider if symptoms are time-limited

The hierarchy depends on whether the depression or psychosis is primary, but the catatonia coding remains consistent across scenarios. Depressive Type - F25.1 (differential consideration). Given the prominent catatonic presentation that prompted admission, I should reconsider the ordering to prioritize what's clinically most urgent. The catatonia itself warrants primary listing since it's the acute presenting problem requiring immediate intervention, followed by Major Depressive Disorder as the likely underlying etiology based on the patient's history. Schizophrenia and Schizoaffective Disorder remain important differentials to exclude, with Brief Psychotic Disorder also considered in the differential workup.","1.

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

Key considerations:

1. **Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type (F25.0)**
This appears to be the most likely diagnosis. The patient has:
- Criterion A: A major mood episode (manic) concurrent with psychotic symptoms (auditory hallucinations present during the manic episode)


- Criterion B: Psychotic symptoms persisting for at least 2 weeks independent of mood disturbance—he's had voices for roughly a year with the manic episode lasting only a couple weeks, indicating substantial periods of psychosis without concurrent mood elevation
- Criterion C: Mood episodes present for a significant portion of the illness duration, though the psychotic symptoms appear more prominent overall
- Criterion D: Symptoms not explained by substance use or medical illness

The persistence of hallucinations both during and outside the manic episode is particularly diagnostic, suggesting schizoaffective disorder rather than bipolar disorder with psychotic features.

Bipolar I would require psychotic symptoms tied primarily to mood episodes, but his year-long voice experience with only a brief manic period contradicts this pattern. Schizophrenia remains possible given the auditory hallucinations and negative symptoms like social withdrawal and poor self-care, though the documented manic episode complicates this diagnosis since schizophrenia typically doesn't include prominent mood disturbances.

The timeline and symptom pattern—psychosis persisting independently alongside a distinct manic episode—points more toward schizoaffective disorder than either condition alone. Schizophreniform would be ruled out given the one-year duration. Brief psychotic disorder doesn't fit the chronic course.

Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type emerges as the strongest fit, accounting for the sustained hallucinations across the full year and the superimposed manic episode. Bipolar I disorder with psychotic features remains possible but less likely since the psychotic symptoms extend well beyond typical mood episode windows. Schizophrenia itself can't be excluded entirely, though the documented manic episode shifts the balance toward schizoaffective. Schizophrenia, unspecified type (F20.9) is another possibility, though the documented manic episode makes this less likely as the sole diagnosis. The one-year duration of psychotic symptoms with a distinct manic period lasting several weeks points more strongly toward Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type (F25.0). The persistence of voices and negative symptoms despite being euthymic currently is the key distinguishing feature—this pattern fits schizoaffective better than bipolar disorder alone, where psychosis typically resolves with mood stabilization.

For the bipolar diagnosis code, I need to account for the fact that he's not currently in a manic episode. F31.71 (most recent episode manic, in partial remission) seems more accurate than F31.2, since the manic phase has passed but occurred recently within this illness course. The primary diagnosis should be Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type (F25.0), given the concurrent mood and psychotic symptoms. If that doesn't fit perfectly, Schizophrenia (F20.9) serves as a reasonable alternative. Other possibilities include Bipolar I Disorder, unspecified (F31.9) if the mood component is more prominent, an unspecified psychotic disorder (F29) if the presentation is atypical, or Schizophreniform Disorder (F20.81) if the duration criteria aren't fully met.","1.

1051,"Patient J is a 30 year old male with past medical history of hyperthyroidism and past psychiatric history of psychosis who presents to the inpatient psychiatric hospital after his family filed a community mental health warrant. Per his wife, the patient has not been sleeping for 2 weeks, not showering, yelling constantly at home, and took out their savings suddenly to open a restaurant. She states he has no restaurant experience and currently works as a plumber, never mentioning wanting to open a restaurant. She states he has been more violent at home, hitting her when she does not “do as he says” and endangering their 2 year old son. She gives an example of how he said that their son “should be able to bathe himself” and shut him in the bathroom by himself, not allowing the mother to enter. She also states he has been reaching out to multiple women on Instagram that he has never met before, asking them on a date and sending explicit photos to them. She has also noticed the patient talking to himself when no one is there. On assessment, the patient is irritable, loud, demanding to be released. Speech is rapid and pressured. He states, “nothing is wrong with me, I feel amazing, I am a God, I am the Messiah, you all are nothing”. He states that he has been “appointed” by God to “save humanity” and that he cannot do so while hospitalized. When asked about sleep, he states “I don’t need sleep, that is for the weak, I sleep maybe 1 hour and I feel amazing, I have good rest”. With regards to substance use, he denies cigarettes or alcohol use, does endorse buying delta 8 vapes from the smoke shop and smoking them. The wife states he started smoking these vapes about 6 months ago. He has seen a therapist before for depression but has never taken any psychiatric medications.","Bipolar disorder, current episode manic, severe, with psychotic features (F31.2)",,juliana_zhang,"Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, with psychotic features","Bipolar disorder, current episode manic, severe, with psychotic features (F31.2)",,"Let me analyze this clinical case vignette systematically.

**Data Extraction and Organization:**

Demographics: 30-year-old male

Past Medical History:
- Hyperthyroidism

Past Psychiatric History:
- Psychosis (unspecified)
- Has seen therapist for depression
- Never taken psychiatric medications

Presenting Problem:
- Family filed community mental health warrant
- Duration: symptoms ongoing for ~2 weeks

Current Symptoms (per collateral from wife):
1. Decreased need for sleep - 2 weeks of not sleeping (patient reports ~1 hour and feels ""amazing"")
2. Poor self-care - not showering
3. Irritability - yelling constantly at home
4. Grandiosity/impulsive spending - took out savings to open restaurant with no experience
5. Violence/aggression - hitting wife, endangering child
6. Hypersexuality - reaching out to multiple women on Instagram, sending explicit photos
7. Talking to himself (possible auditory hallucinations or responding to internal stimuli)

Mental Status Examination:
- Mood: Irritable
- Affect: Likely expansive/irritable
- Speech: Rapid, pressured
- Thought content: Grandiose delusions (""I am a God, I am the Messiah, appointed by God to save humanity"")
- Insight: Poor (""nothing is wrong with me"")
- Judgment: Impaired

Substance Use:
- Denies cigarettes and alcohol
- Uses delta-8 THC vapes for 6 months

Risk Factors:
- Family violence
- Child endangerment
- Impaired judgment

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

The clinical picture strongly suggests a manic episode with psychotic features:
- Decreased need for sleep (1 hour and feels rested)
- Grandiosity (believes he's the Messiah, appointed by God)
- Pressured speech
- Increased goal-directed activity (opening restaurant impulsively)


- Risky behaviors including reckless spending and sexual disinhibition with strangers
- Marked irritability throughout the presentation
- Symptom duration exceeding one week
- Presence of delusions and possible hallucinations given his self-directed speech

**Differential Diagnosis:**

Bipolar I Disorder, Current Episode Manic, Severe with Psychotic Features (F31.2) appears most likely. The patient demonstrates the full constellation of manic symptoms—decreased sleep need, grandiose ideation, pressured speech, increased goal-directed activity, impulsivity, and hypersexuality—alongside clear psychotic features including his messianic delusions. His history of prior psychotic episodes and depression further supports this diagnosis.

Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type (F25.0) must be considered given his documented psychiatric history involving psychosis. The key distinction would be whether psychotic symptoms occurred independently of mood episodes, though his current presentation shows mood-congruent psychotic features that align more closely with a manic episode.

Substance-induced effects from his six-month Delta-8 THC use warrant consideration, though the symptom severity seems disproportionate to typical cannabis effects, and Delta-8 is less potent than Delta-9 THC. While it may be a contributing factor, it's unlikely the primary cause and other etiologies need exclusion.

Hyperthyroidism could produce manic-like symptoms, so thyroid function tests are necessary, but the clinical presentation and severity point more toward primary bipolar disorder. Brief Psychotic Disorder is less likely given the prominence of mood symptoms, and Schizophrenia is similarly unlikely since the mood disturbance is too central to the presentation. An unspecified psychotic disorder remains a possibility but is less probable than the leading diagnoses.

My primary consideration is Bipolar I Disorder, Current Episode Manic, Severe with Psychotic Features—the patient demonstrates the full constellation of manic symptoms including elevated and irritable mood, markedly decreased sleep need, grandiose ideation, rapid speech, increased goal-directed behavior, and impulsivity, along with grandiose delusions. The history of depression further supports this diagnosis. Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type warrants consideration given the documented psychotic history, particularly if psychotic symptoms have emerged independently of mood episodes previously. Cannabis use, specifically Delta-8 THC, could also be contributing to or precipitating a bipolar presentation.

I should also evaluate for medical causes—hyperthyroidism is known to produce manic-like symptoms and requires investigation. If the clinical picture remains unclear or if past psychotic episodes lack clear mood correlation, an unspecified psychotic disorder diagnosis might be more appropriate pending further assessment.

The most likely diagnoses appear to be Bipolar I Disorder, Current Episode Manic, Severe with Psychotic Features (F31.2), though substance-induced bipolar disorder from cannabis use (F12.94) and schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type (F25.0) should be ruled out. Medical etiologies like hyperthyroidism causing manic features (F06.33) need investigation, and cannabis use disorder severity should be documented based on the pattern of use. The regular delta-8 use over six months does support a Cannabis Use Disorder diagnosis at the moderate level. However, the manic presentation remains the primary clinical concern. I'm settling on the differential diagnoses with Bipolar I Disorder, Current Episode Manic, Severe with Psychotic Features as the leading diagnosis, followed by Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type as an alternative given the psychotic features. Cannabis Use Disorder at moderate severity and the possibility of a bipolar disorder secondary to the hyperthyroidism should also be documented. The substance-induced presentation is worth considering as well, though the symptom severity and pattern suggest an underlying mood disorder rather than purely substance-driven psychosis.","1.

**Data Extraction and Organization:**

Demographics:
- 15-year-old Hispanic female
- Psychiatric history: Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), stable on low-dose SSRI for over a year

Timeline:
- 2 months ago: Death of pet cat (significant emotional stressor)
- 3-4 weeks ago: New onset of symptoms

Current Symptoms:
1. Insomnia/trouble falling asleep
2. Panic attacks (one described episode 2 weeks ago with shortness of breath, diaphoresis, palpitations)
3. Difficulty concentrating
4. Persistent crying spells
5. Intrusive flashbacks of cat's death and burial
6. Loss of appetite
7. Constricted affect
8. Anticipatory anxiety about panic attacks recurring
9. Decline in academic performance
10. Frequent intrusive thoughts about pet during class
11. ""Loses her train of thought"" due to preoccupying memories

Protective Factors/Negative Findings:
- Denies anhedonia
- Denies active or passive suicidal ideation
- Still enjoys school and spending time with friends/sister
- Continues to engage in previously enjoyed activities
- Reports ongoing support from mother, stepfather, friends
- Appeared more cheerful when discussing positive aspects of life

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

1. **Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood (F43.23)**
- Clear identifiable stressor: death of pet cat (2 months ago)
- Symptoms developed within 3 months of stressor
- Emotional/behavioral symptoms: depressed mood (crying, constricted affect), anxiety (panic-like episode, worry), functional impairment (academic decline)
- Does not meet full criteria for major depressive episode (no anhedonia, still enjoys activities, no suicidal ideation)


- The stressor doesn't qualify for PTSD criteria, which requires exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence. Symptom duration also fits the adjustment disorder timeline of less than 6 months.

2. **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1)**
- Pre-existing diagnosis currently managed with SSRI monotherapy
- Baseline anxiety condition that may be exacerbated by the recent loss

3. **Panic Disorder (F41.0)**
- Single documented panic attack with classic features: dyspnea, diaphoresis, palpitations
- Anticipatory anxiety about future episodes is present, though limited evidence of recurrent panic attacks or panic-related behavioral changes at this point

. The panic appears triggered by intrusive thoughts rather than occurring unexpectedly, which doesn't align with typical panic disorder presentation.

4. **Prolonged Grief Disorder (F43.8)**
- Grief symptoms are present—yearning, preoccupation, intrusive memories—but only 2 months have elapsed since the loss. DSM-5-TR requires at least 12 months for adults, so the timeline is insufficient for this diagnosis.

5. **Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode (F32.x)**
- Depressive features are evident: sleep disruption, appetite changes, and concentration difficulties

. However, the person denies anhedonia and continues engaging with activities they enjoy, with no suicidal thoughts. This falls short of the five-symptom threshold needed for MDD.

6. **Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder (F43.89)**
- While trauma-related symptoms are present, a pet's death typically doesn't satisfy PTSD Criterion A, though this diagnosis could apply if other trauma criteria aren't fully met.

7. **Other Specified Anxiety Disorder (F41.8)**
- Could be considered if anxiety predominates but doesn't fit established anxiety disorder categories.

The clinical picture points most clearly to **Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood (F43.23)**—there's a direct link between the pet's death and the onset of symptoms, with both anxiety and mood disturbance present but not severe enough to meet criteria for distinct anxiety or mood disorders.

Secondary considerations include pre-existing Generalized Anxiety Disorder (currently managed with SSRI), a single panic episode with ongoing worry about recurrence, possible Prolonged Grief Disorder given the intensity of loss, and Unspecified Depressive Disorder if the mood symptoms become more prominent. The intrusive memories and flashbacks could also suggest Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder if they don't align with the adjustment disorder pattern. ) - or Major Depressive Disorder, mild, single episode (F32.0) if depressive symptoms predominate, though they don't fully meet threshold criteria.

The intrusive flashbacks and memories about the pet are quite striking and warrant consideration. While pet loss typically doesn't satisfy PTSD's Criterion A, the prominence of intrusive thoughts, flashback-like experiences, and some avoidance patterns suggest exploring Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder. For panic symptoms, she experienced at least one panic attack with subsequent worry about recurrence, potentially meeting Panic Disorder criteria if the attack was truly unexpected, though it emerged within the context of her intrusive thoughts about the cat. Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood remains the strongest fit given the clear stressor and mixed presentation, with Generalized Anxiety Disorder as the established baseline condition. 1.

1053,"A 20-year-old African American male with no prior psychiatric history presented to the emergency department with a one-week history of abnormal behavior, depressed mood, and headaches. He had been functioning well and working full-time until the onset of symptoms. One month prior, he had tested positive for COVID-19. Initial symptoms included anxiety, insomnia, depressed mood, and headache, which rapidly progressed to auditory hallucinations, paranoia, and functional impairment, raising concerns for an acute psychiatric or neurological process.

Key clinical features to extract and organize:

Demographics:
- 20-year-old African American male
- No prior psychiatric history
- Previously functioning well, working full-time

Timeline:
- 1 month prior: COVID-19 infection
- 1 week of abnormal behavior, depressed mood, headaches before ED presentation
- Rapid progression of symptoms
- Day 3 of psychiatric hospitalization: became selectively mute, immobile, refused oral intake
- Development of low-grade fever and intermittent twitching of right arm
- Full recovery within approximately 1 month

Initial symptoms:
- Anxiety
- Insomnia
- Depressed mood
- Headache

Progression to:
- Auditory hallucinations
- Paranoia
- Functional impairment

Catatonic features (day 3):
- Selective mutism
- Immobility
- Refusal of oral intake (negativism)

Additional findings:
- Low-grade fever
- Intermittent twitching of right arm

Treatment response:
- No response to haloperidol, benztropine, olanzapine, lorazepam, hydroxyzine initially
- Partial response to benzodiazepines later
- Gradual improvement with return of speech, mobility, normalized vital signs
- Full recovery within 1 month

Workup:
- Basic labs: within normal limits
- Brain imaging: unremarkable
- EEG: moderate encephalopathy without epileptiform activity
- Autoimmune encephalitis workup: no definitive diagnosis established

Diagnostic considerations:

1. Catatonia due to another medical condition (F06.1) - The patient developed clear catatonic features (mutism, immobility, negativism with food refusal) in the context of recent COVID-19 infection. The EEG showed moderate encephalopathy, suggesting an organic process. The response to benzodiazepines is consistent with catatonia. COVID-19 has been associated with various neuropsychiatric manifestations including catatonia.


2. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition (F06.2) - The hallucinations and paranoid ideation emerged following COVID-19 infection with concurrent encephalopathic changes on EEG. The acute presentation without prior psychiatric history and complete resolution within weeks align with a secondary psychotic process rather than a primary psychiatric disorder.
3. Brief psychotic disorder (F23) - While the symptom duration and full recovery fit this diagnosis, the presence of medical factors (recent infection, encephalopathy, fever, focal neurological signs) suggests an underlying organic etiology is more probable.
4. Unspecified catatonia (F06.1) - Given the unclear medical etiology despite workup, this diagnosis captures the prominent catatonic presentation.
5. Depressive disorder due to another medical condition (F06.31 or F06.32) - Depressed mood was a significant early feature.
6. Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition (F06.4) - Anxiety symptoms were evident throughout.
7. Delirium due to another medical condition (F05) - The EEG findings of encephalopathy and the medical context support this, though the typical fluctuating level of consciousness wasn't clearly documented.

The clinical presentation points most strongly toward a medical etiology. The constellation of recent COVID-19 infection, rapid psychiatric symptom onset in someone with no prior mental health history, catatonic features, low-grade fever, motor abnormalities, and EEG evidence of encephalopathy all suggest the symptoms stem from an organic brain process rather than a primary psychiatric condition.

The rapid response to benzodiazepines and complete recovery further support catatonic disorder due to another medical condition as the primary diagnosis. Psychotic features and delirium likely represent manifestations of the same underlying medical process rather than separate conditions. Brief psychotic disorder remains a consideration if the etiology were primarily psychiatric, but the medical findings make this less likely. to another medical condition (F05), and unspecified mental disorder due to another medical condition (F09). Brief psychotic disorder (F23) is less likely given the clear medical context.

The moderate encephalopathy on EEG and absence of confirmed autoimmune etiology point toward a medical cause. COVID-19 is known to trigger various neuropsychiatric complications including psychosis, catatonia, and encephalopathy, which fits this clinical picture. The catatonic features—mutism, immobility, negativism—were the most striking presentation and occurred within the context of documented medical illness, making catatonic disorder due to another medical condition the primary diagnosis. Hallucinations were also present, supporting consideration of psychotic disorder due to another medical condition with hallucinations as a secondary possibility. The catatonic presentation—mutism, immobility, refusal to eat—stands out as the primary feature, so catatonic disorder due to another medical condition (F06.1) should lead the differential. The psychotic symptoms and depressed mood are secondary manifestations in this medical context. I'd also include psychotic disorder due to another medical condition (F06.0) given the hallucinations and paranoia, delirium due to another medical condition (F05) for the encephalopathy findings, and depressive disorder due to another medical condition (F06.31) to capture the mood component. Brief psychotic disorder (F23) remains a consideration if the presentation were primarily psychiatric rather than medically driven.","1. Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition - F06.1

**Data Extraction and Organization:**

Demographics:
- 16-year-old Asian male
- No prior psychiatric history

Presenting concerns:
- Dizziness, low blood pressure, significant weight loss (noted by school nurse)
- Low BMI
- Orthostatic hypotension (dizziness on standing) - likely secondary to malnutrition
- Poor nutritional status (CPS investigation findings)

Timeline:
- 6-8 months of depressed mood and feeling overwhelmed with school

Psychiatric evaluation findings:
- Dysphoric appearance with downcast eyes
- Significant thought blocking
- Constricted affect
- Avoided eye contact
- Limited verbal communication
- Endorsed recurrent death thoughts (nodded yes)
- Endorsed having a plan for suicide (nodded yes but didn't disclose)

Family observations:
- Recent withdrawal
- Tiredness
- Lack of appetite
- Weight loss
- Family unaware of severity

History:
- School bullying
- Otherwise unremarkable developmental history
- Academic pressure

Course during hospitalization (Day 2):
- Stopped speaking entirely (mutism)
- Refused to move (immobility/stupor)
- Refused food
- Did not follow directions (negativism)
- Staring
- Unusual mannerisms

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

The clinical picture is complex and evolving. Let me work through this systematically:

1. **Major Depressive Disorder with Catatonic Features:**
The patient has a clear depressive syndrome:
- Depressed mood for 6-8 months
- Decreased appetite and significant weight loss
- Withdrawal
- Fatigue/tiredness
- Suicidal ideation with a plan
- Constricted affect

On day 2, he develops classic catatonic features:
- Mutism (stopped speaking entirely)
- Stupor (refused to move)


- Resistance to commands (refused food, did not follow directions)
- Staring and unusual mannerisms

This presentation aligns with Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Severe, with Catatonic Features.

2. **Catatonia as a separate diagnostic entity:**
The catatonic symptoms could also be coded independently as catatonia associated with another mental disorder (F06.1) per DSM-5-TR, which allows for specifying catatonic features in the context of an underlying condition.

3. **Avoidant/Selective Mutism considerations:**
While the mutism and withdrawal could suggest avoidant features or selective mutism, the acute onset of complete behavioral shutdown on day 2 combined with the depressive prodrome and catatonic features makes primary mood disorder with catatonia more likely than a primary anxiety or avoidant disorder.

4. **Eating concerns secondary to mood:**
The significant weight loss and reduced appetite could reflect depression-related anorexia rather than a primary eating disorder like ARFID or Anorexia Nervosa, since there's no documented body image disturbance or weight phobia. The nutritional decline appears driven by the depressive episode and academic stressors rather than disordered eating cognitions.

5. **Adjustment Disorder ruled out:**
Though academic pressure and bullying are clear stressors, the 6-8 month duration combined with suicidal ideation with plan and catatonic features exceed what would be expected in an adjustment disorder, making MDD the more appropriate primary diagnosis.

5. **

Psychotic spectrum considerations:**
The thought blocking raises questions about whether a psychotic process is emerging, and catatonia could align with early-onset schizophrenia. However, without clear hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized speech prior to the catatonic state, and with thought blocking potentially representing a prodromal sign rather than established psychosis, this seems less likely than a severe mood disorder with catatonic features.

6. **Depressive disorder with catatonia:**
The presentation most consistently fits Major Depressive Disorder with catatonic features as the primary diagnosis, given the depressed mood, anhedonia, suicidal ideation with plan, and neurovegetative symptoms, with catatonia emerging as a severe manifestation of the mood disturbance rather than indicating a primary psychotic or neurological condition.

7. **Eating disorder considerations:**
The significant weight loss and low BMI warrant evaluation for Anorexia Nervosa, though the acute presentation and catatonic features suggest the weight loss may be secondary to the psychiatric crisis rather than primary restrictive eating patterns.

**Diagnostic formulation:**
The most parsimonious diagnosis appears to be Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Severe with Catatonic Features (F32.2 with catatonia specifier, or F06.1 for catatonia associated with another mental disorder). Anorexia Nervosa should remain on the differential given the documented weight loss and low BMI, requiring careful assessment of whether eating restriction is primary or secondary to the mood disturbance. The catatonia that emerged on day 2 appears to be the acute manifestation of an underlying depressive episode. Both the depression diagnosis and the catatonia code should be applied according to DSM-5-TR guidelines. The differential includes eating disorder features given the weight loss and restricted intake, possible psychotic symptoms based on thought blocking, and adjustment disorder, though the timeline and severity point more toward major depression as the primary condition. The depressed mood has persisted for 6-8 months with significant anhedonia and neurovegetative symptoms. the bullying history could be a contributing factor. Reconsidering the eating disorder diagnosis, ARFID might fit better than Anorexia if there's no documented body image concerns. For the fifth diagnosis, I'm weighing between an unspecified anxiety disorder or adjustment disorder given the academic pressures and social stressors.

Though I should consider whether the eating disturbance is truly primary or secondary to the depression, which might change whether it warrants its own diagnosis.

For the psychotic features, F29 seems more fitting than F20.9 since I don't have sufficient evidence to confirm schizophrenia—the thought blocking and catatonic presentation could align with early-onset psychosis, but the diagnostic picture remains unclear.","1.

1055,"A 29-year-old female, 10-days postpartum, presented with her husband for new-onset command auditory hallucinations, decreased sleep, poor hygiene and paranoia. The patient has a diagnosis of bipolar 1 disorder, and stopped taking her medications at the beginning of pregnancy. The patient seemed very distant to her baby but denied any thoughts of harming the baby. This is the first time that patient experienced such symptoms, and she was admitted to the psychiatric unit for evaluation and management. Initial mental status exam on admission revealed flight of ideas, inappropriate laughter, paranoid delusions, distractibility, poor hygiene and hyper talkativeness. Laboratory tests were clinically unremarkable. Olanzapine was started and titrated appropriately. Melatonin and temazepam nightly were started to regulate her circadian rhythm. Due to lack of effect, olanzapine was changed to risperidone. After 1-week of admission, significant improvement in her symptoms were noticed. Her sleep condition stabilized initially, and she demonstrated a partial return to baseline functioning, with improved mood and cognition. The patient was discharged on day 10. However, after a week of her discharge, the patient experienced a relapse of some of her symptoms. She became increasingly agitated, paranoid, and starting responding to internal stimuli. The family later reported that they stopped giving the medication upon discharge as the patient seemed back to baseline and with a worry that the medications may be excreted in breast milk. Restarting psychotropics resulted in marked improvement, and the patient’s condition stabilized once again.",Post-partum psychosis (F53.1),,pooja_chaudhary,,,This looks like post-partum psychosis mainly due to underlying bipolar disorder.,"Let me analyze this clinical case carefully.

Key clinical information:
- 29-year-old female
- 10-days postpartum
- New-onset symptoms: command auditory hallucinations, decreased sleep, poor hygiene, paranoia
- History of bipolar 1 disorder
- Stopped medications at beginning of pregnancy
- Distant to baby but denied thoughts of harm
- First episode of these specific symptoms
- MSE: flight of ideas, inappropriate laughter, paranoid delusions, distractibility, poor hygiene, hyper talkativeness
- Labs unremarkable
- Responded to antipsychotics (olanzapine then risperidone)
- Relapsed when medications stopped, improved again when restarted

Analysis:

1. The timing (10 days postpartum) and presentation strongly suggest a postpartum psychiatric episode.

2. The patient has a pre-existing diagnosis of bipolar 1 disorder.

3. Current symptoms include:
- Manic symptoms: flight of ideas, inappropriate laughter, distractibility, hyper talkativeness, decreased sleep
- Psychotic symptoms: command auditory hallucinations, paranoid delusions, responding to internal stimuli

4. This presentation is consistent with Bipolar I Disorder, current episode manic with psychotic features, with peripartum onset.

In DSM-5-TR, when someone with bipolar disorder has a mood episode during pregnancy or within 4 weeks postpartum, you would specify ""with peripartum onset.""

The primary diagnosis would be:
Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe, with psychotic features, with peripartum onset

ICD-10 code: F31.2 (Bipolar affective disorder, current episode manic with psychotic features)

Differential diagnoses to consider:

1. Brief psychotic disorder with peripartum onset (F23) - but this would typically be used if there wasn't a pre-existing mood disorder
2. Postpartum psychosis - this is not a separate DSM-5-TR diagnosis but is captured under mood disorders with peripartum onset specifier or brief psychotic disorder with postpartum onset


3. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type (F25.0) - less likely given the established bipolar history and clear mood episode driving the presentation. Schizophreniform disorder (F20.81) is also unlikely with prominent manic features. Medication nonadherence is a contributing factor rather than a diagnosis itself. Other considerations like unspecified schizophrenia spectrum disorder, major depressive disorder with psychotic features, or substance-induced psychotic disorder don't fit as well given the clinical picture and unremarkable labs.

Using the DSM-5-TR criteria, the primary diagnosis is Bipolar I disorder, current manic episode, severe with psychotic features (F31.2), with peripartum onset specifier. While brief psychotic disorder with peripartum onset, schizoaffective disorder bipolar type, and other specified or unspecified bipolar and related disorders could theoretically apply, they're less fitting given her documented Bipolar I history. The key is recognizing that the current manic episode with psychotic features in the postpartum period represents an exacerbation of her existing condition rather than a new diagnostic entity. The primary diagnosis is Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe, with psychotic features (F31.2), given her established psychiatric history. The differential would include schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type (F25.0) if psychotic symptoms appeared more independent of mood episodes, brief psychotic disorder (F23) if this presentation were new without prior bipolar history, and schizophreniform disorder (F20.81) as less likely alternatives. Additional considerations might involve medication adherence issues or relational problems with the infant, though these wouldn't constitute primary psychiatric diagnoses.","1.

Interestingly, a child can-not be diagnosed with ODD and DMDD at the same time and hence its important to differentiate.","Let me carefully analyze this clinical case vignette to develop an accurate differential diagnosis.

**Data Extraction and Organization:**

Demographics:
- 15-year-old male
- Lives with biological mother and stepfather

Presenting Problem:
- Recent inpatient discharge following assault on male peer at school
- Current outpatient follow-up

Current Mental Status Examination:
- Irritable appearance
- One-word responses (limited speech)
- Avoided eye contact

Behavioral History (Longitudinal Pattern):
- Longstanding behavioral difficulties
- Chronic irritability
- Frequent angry outbursts
- Academic struggles - had to repeat 4th grade
- Recent decline in grades
- Slams doors during arguments at home
- Getting into fights at school
- Argued with principal when he felt his justification wasn't heard
- Was kicked off basketball team after argument with peer

Developmental History:
- Reached all developmental milestones appropriately
- No history of trauma or abuse reported

Social Functioning:
- No friends
- Tends to isolate himself
- Good at basketball (strength)
- Enjoys camping
- Has 3 pet dogs and 2 cats (all adopted)
- He is the primary caretaker of all pets (shows responsibility and nurturing capacity)

Negative Findings:
- No hallucinations or delusions
- No known substance use

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

1. **Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) - F34.81**
Key features supporting this:
- Chronic irritability (persistent, severe)
- Frequent angry outbursts (temper outbursts)
- Present for a longstanding period (sounds like more than 12 months)
- Present in multiple settings (home, school)
- Age is appropriate (onset before 10, current age between 6-18)
- The irritability is described as chronic and between outbursts
- Functional impairment (academic struggles, social isolation, kicked off team)


- Need to clarify whether outbursts are grossly disproportionate to triggers, occur at least 3 times weekly, and have persisted for 12+ months without a 3+ month symptom-free interval.

2. **Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) - F91.3**
Supporting features:
- Angry/irritable mood (often loses temper, often angry and resentful)
- Argumentative/defiant behavior (argues with authority figures - principal incident)
- Pattern lasting at least 6 months
- Multiple settings (home, school)
- Functional impairment
- This diagnosis also fits well given the chronic pattern of defiance and anger across contexts.

3. **Conduct Disorder, Adolescent-Onset Type - F91.2**
Supporting features:
- Assault on peer (aggression to people)
- Getting into fights
- However, there's limited evidence of other CD criteria like:
  - Destruction of property
  - Deceitfulness/theft
  - Serious violations of rules
  - Cruelty to animals (actually the opposite - he cares for pets)
  - Bullying/threatening/intimidating

The assault is concerning but may be isolated. Need to determine if this is part of a broader pattern meeting CD criteria.

4. **Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) - F90.x**
Supporting features:
- Academic struggles
- Had to repeat 4th grade
- The arguing with the principal, school fights, and door slamming at home all align with ODD presentation. The assault incident raises questions about whether conduct disorder criteria are met, though other hallmark features like property destruction or theft aren't evident. Academic difficulties and grade retention suggest possible ADHD involvement that warrants further assessment.

5. **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) - F32.x or F33.x**
The irritability, social withdrawal, and declining academic performance could indicate depression, though key symptoms like depressed mood, sleep disturbances, appetite changes, or hopelessness aren't documented. This remains a consideration given the behavioral and social changes.

6. **Unspecified Depressive Disorder or Depressive Disorder NOS**
If the presentation doesn't fully meet major depressive disorder criteria, a depressive disorder not otherwise specified could apply.

7. **Autism Spectrum Disorder - F84.0**
Social isolation and avoidance of eye contact might suggest autism, particularly with the noted interest in animals. However, normal developmental milestones, adequate motor coordination shown through basketball, and some family social engagement make this less probable. The eye contact avoidance seems more connected to the irritability and oppositional patterns.

8. **Adjustment Disorder with Disturbance of Conduct - F43.24**
This is unlikely since the symptoms appear chronic rather than reactive to a specific identifiable stressor.

The most compelling diagnosis appears to be Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, given the severe irritability, behavioral dyscontrol, and mood instability that best fit the clinical presentation.

Oppositional Defiant Disorder also warrants consideration with the argumentative and defiant behaviors toward authority figures. However, DSM-5-TR specifies that DMDD takes diagnostic precedence when both sets of criteria are met, so ODD would not be separately diagnosed. The distinguishing factor hinges on whether chronic severe irritability with explosive outbursts (DMDD) or primarily argumentative/defiant behavior (ODD) dominates the clinical picture. The emphasis on persistent irritability and frequent outbursts across multiple settings suggests DMDD is the primary diagnosis.

Conduct Disorder could apply given the assault and multiple physical altercations, though other conduct-related criteria appear limited. ADHD warrants evaluation due to academic struggles and behavioral dysregulation. Depression should also be considered, as adolescent irritability and social withdrawal can mask underlying mood disturbance, with academic decline potentially reflecting depressive symptoms rather than purely behavioral issues. /Hyperactivity Disorder, Unspecified (F90.9) - to rule out given the academic decline and possible attention difficulties. I should also consider depressive symptoms and social anxiety, particularly the isolation and difficulty with eye contact, though these may be secondary to the primary mood dysregulation.

The pattern of aggression and fighting raises concerns about conduct disorder as a comorbid presentation. The chronic irritability with frequent outbursts strongly supports DMDD as the primary diagnosis, with conduct disorder potentially developing alongside it. Academic struggles could reflect either ADHD or the impact of the mood disturbance itself. often gets into altercations) - that's only 1 criterion met. For Conduct Disorder diagnosis, I need at least 3 criteria in the past 12 months with at least one in the past 6 months. This patient doesn't meet threshold for CD.

ODD is more fitting here - the pattern of defiance, argumentativeness, and occasional physical aggression without the more serious violations of others' rights that CD requires. The irritability, frequent arguments with authority figures, and angry outbursts align better with ODD criteria than the more severe behavioral violations needed for CD. possibly (wanting principal to hear his justification). For vindictiveness, there's no clear evidence of spitefulness. ODD criteria seem largely met with sufficient symptoms, though DMDD takes precedence given the chronic irritability pattern. The assault does raise questions about Conduct Disorder severity—multiple fights and a serious peer assault that led to hospitalization suggest potential CD criteria beyond just the single aggressive act. I should consider whether the pattern of aggression and property damage (door slamming) might indicate a more serious disruptive behavior disorder.

The primary diagnoses appear to be DMDD based on the irritability and outburst profile, with Conduct Disorder as a secondary consideration given the documented fighting and assault. ADHD warrants inclusion given academic struggles and the repeated grade. Depressive features also seem present with the social withdrawal and academic decline. I need to finalize the diagnostic formulation with these considerations in mind.

For the fifth diagnosis, ODD would typically be excluded since it's mutually exclusive with DMDD. Given the social isolation, absence of peer relationships, and difficulty with eye contact, Social Anxiety Disorder seems more clinically relevant than other options. Intermittent Explosive Disorder could theoretically apply given the aggressive outbursts, but DSM-5-TR guidelines preclude concurrent diagnosis with DMDD as the primary condition, and the patient's presentation fits better within the DMDD framework.

My final differential includes DMDD as primary, alongside Conduct Disorder (adolescent-onset), ADHD (unspecified), Major Depressive Disorder (single episode), and Social Anxiety Disorder. The distinction between DMDD and ODD hinges on whether severe irritability persists between explosive episodes—if DMDD criteria aren't fully satisfied, ODD would become the appropriate alternative diagnosis instead. episode, unspecified. F32.9 works better for Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, unspecified since it's the standard code. So my final differential includes Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (F34.81) as the primary consideration given the chronic irritability and explosive outbursts, followed by Oppositional Defiant Disorder (F91.3), Conduct Disorder adolescent-onset (F91.2) accounting for the aggressive behavior, ADHD unspecified (F90.9) for the academic difficulties, and Major Depressive Disorder single episode unspecified (F32.9) to capture the mood disturbance and social withdrawal.","1.

1057,"A 77-year-old Caucasian female with a longstanding history of depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), chronic musculoskeletal pain and cannabis use disorder, presented to the outpatient clinic with visible facial scarring due to persistent skin picking.

Insight is preserved and the patient is not delusional or psychotic.","Let me analyze this clinical case vignette carefully, extracting and organizing the relevant clinical information.

**Patient Demographics:**
- 77-year-old Caucasian female

**Past Psychiatric History:**
- Longstanding history of depression
- Anxiety
- Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
- Cannabis use disorder

**Medical History:**
- Chronic musculoskeletal pain
- Chronic back pain (currently receiving treatment)

**Presenting Problem:**
- Visible facial scarring due to persistent skin picking
- Recent wound infection on lower lip requiring dermatology visit

**Timeline and Triggers:**
- Current episode began 6 weeks ago
- Temporal relationship to death of two pet cats (a few weeks before onset)
- Ongoing family-related stressors including death of only sibling (brother)
- Similar episode ~45 years ago following brother's ""institutionalization"" after his first psychotic episode

**Behavioral Pattern:**
- Picks at skin, doesn't like the feel of scabs
- Intense desire to pick at scabs
- Scabs often bleed
- Sense of gratification immediately after picking
- Feeling of guilt and shame a few minutes later
- Tried wearing gloves to stop but continues
- Picks at scabs and healing skin, particularly on face

**Mental Status:**
- Calm, cooperative
- Logical thought process

**Current Treatment:**
- Maximum dose of an SSRI
- Treatment for chronic back pain

**Coping/Substance Use:**
- Uses marijuana (believes it helps her cope)
- Tried self-hypnosis (no improvement)
- News media consumption worsens anxiety

**Differential Diagnosis:**

1. **Excoriation (Skin-Picking) Disorder (F42.4)** - PRIMARY
This is the most prominent diagnosis based on:
- Recurrent skin picking resulting in skin lesions (visible facial scarring, wound infection)
- Repeated attempts to decrease or stop the behavior (tried gloves, self-hypnosis)


- The behavior causes significant distress with guilt and shame following episodes, and has resulted in physical damage requiring medical intervention. The characteristic cycle of tension relief and subsequent remorse fits the diagnostic pattern perfectly.

2. **Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent (F33.x)** - Longstanding depression history with current exacerbation likely related to recent losses and stressors, currently managed on maximum SSRI dosing.

3. **Generalized Anxiety Disorder** - Anxiety symptoms present, worsened by media consumption, contributing to overall distress.

4. **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (F42.2)** - Documented OCD history, though excoriation disorder is classified separately in DSM-5-TR despite its relationship to the OCD spectrum.

5. **Cannabis Use Disorder (F12.x)** - Current use as a coping mechanism for anxiety and stress.

6. **Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood** - The temporal relationship between identifiable stressors and symptom emergence warrants consideration.

The skin picking itself represents the primary presenting concern and clearly meets criteria for Excoriation Disorder—recurrent picking causing visible skin lesions, repeated attempts to decrease the behavior, and significant functional impairment or distress directly attributable to the picking episodes.

The coding presents a challenge since Excoriation Disorder maps to L98.1 under dermatological conditions rather than an F-code. Given the constraint to F-codes only, I need to determine whether this should be coded under OCD-related conditions or if another classification better captures the presentation. d be best coded as F42.8 (Other obsessive-compulsive disorder) when F-codes are required, though the primary DSM-5-TR classification uses L98.1. I'm reconsidering the coding approach since the user specifically requested F-codes, which suggests they need mental health diagnostic codes rather than dermatological ones. F42.4 might apply in some systems, but F42.8 appears more appropriate for body-focused repetitive behaviors that don't fit standard OCD presentations. For billing or diagnostic purposes where only psychiatric codes are available, this would be the most suitable classification.

The differential diagnosis should include the documented conditions: Major Depressive Disorder (F33.1 or F33.2 given the chronic course and maximal SSRI treatment), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1), the established OCD history (F42.2), and Cannabis Use Disorder (F12.10 or F12.20 depending on severity assessment).

The skin-picking presents as the primary clinical concern meeting full diagnostic criteria, though it may represent either a distinct excoriation disorder or a manifestation of her existing OCD. Since the DSM-5-TR code for excoriation disorder (L98.1) falls outside the F-code system, F42.4 serves as the most appropriate OCD-spectrum classification for this presentation. is for hair pulling, not skin picking. The most appropriate F-codes would be F42.4 for excoriation specifically, F42.8 for other OCD-related presentations, or F63.8 for habit and impulse disorders. Given the urge-relief-guilt cycle and OCD spectrum relationship, F42.4 seems most fitting. The differential diagnosis includes Excoriation Disorder (F42.4), Major Depressive Disorder recurrent moderate (F33.1) given the chronic depression and bereavement context, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1), and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (F42.2).

For cannabis use, the severity coding depends on whether she meets criteria for moderate versus mild disorder. She uses it as a coping mechanism and has documented ongoing use, but without clear evidence of unsuccessful attempts to reduce or significant functional impairment beyond what's described, mild use disorder (F12.10) may be more appropriate than moderate. Prolonged Grief Disorder (F43.8) could also be considered given the losses of pets and her brother, though the clinical picture centers more on the skin-picking behavior.

The final diagnoses are: Excoriation Disorder (F42.4), Major Depressive Disorder recurrent (F33.1), Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (F42.2), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1), and Cannabis Use Disorder mild (F12.10).","1. Excoriation (Skin-Picking) Disorder - F42.4

**Data Extraction and Organization:**

Demographics:
- 20-year-old male
- College student

Presenting concerns/behaviors:
- Bizarre behavior
- Social withdrawal
- Not eating or sleeping
- Abrupt mood shifts
- Absent from classes for 4 weeks, then returned appearing disheveled
- Noticeably different from baseline

Mental Status Examination findings:
- Slow, delayed speech that unexpectedly escalated in volume
- Abruptly left mid-conversation without explanation
- Difficulty maintaining focus
- Vague or tangential responses
- Bizarre delusions: ""god made me a rabbit and you are my master"" and ""I have killed multiple planets in my backyard""

Timeline:
- Past 2-3 months: stopped attending parties and classes, isolating, making odd statements
- 4 weeks absent from classes before sudden return
- Current presentation is ""the worst"" his roommate has seen

Substance use history:
- Chronic marijuana use since age 14
- Tried crack cocaine and mushrooms last year (during Arizona trip) - had a ""bad trip""
- No witnessed substance use since then
- Current urine drug screen: NEGATIVE
- Alcohol levels: normal

Lab findings:
- Creatinine kinase: significantly elevated
- All other labs normal

Family history:
- Father: schizophrenia
- Mother: alcohol use disorder (died from alcoholic cirrhosis)

**Diagnostic Reasoning:**

1. **Schizophreniform Disorder vs. Schizophrenia:**
The patient presents with:
- Delusions (bizarre content - being a rabbit, killing planets)
- Disorganized speech (tangential responses)
- Negative symptoms (social withdrawal, avolition - not attending classes)
- Grossly disorganized behavior (bizarre behavior, leaving mid-conversation)

Duration: The symptoms have been present for 2-3 months, which is:


- Greater than 1 month (meets Criterion A duration for schizophrenia)
- Less than 6 months (would be schizophreniform disorder)
- Greater than 6 months would be schizophrenia

Given the timeline of 2-3 months, this falls into **Schizophreniform Disorder** territory. The strong paternal history of schizophrenia significantly increases his risk for developing a primary psychotic disorder.

2. **Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder:**
- History of chronic marijuana use since age 14
- Past use of crack cocaine and mushrooms
- However, current urine drug screen is NEGATIVE
- The timing and negative drug screen make active substance use less likely as the primary cause, though chronic marijuana exposure during adolescence could have contributed to underlying vulnerability.

3. **Brief Psychotic Disorder:**
- Requires symptom duration under 1 month, which doesn't fit this 2-3 month presentation, so it's excluded.

4. **Cannabis Use Disorder:**
- Six years of chronic use starting in early adolescence warrants consideration as a comorbid diagnosis, regardless of current negative screening.

5. **Elevated CK (Creatinine Kinase):**
- This abnormal finding needs investigation, as it could suggest neuroleptic malignant syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, or other medical complications.

6. **Catatonia:**
- While some features like abrupt behavioral changes and variable speech patterns are present, the full catatonic syndrome isn't clearly evident.

The elevated CK likely reflects physical distress from poor self-care, agitation, or possible psychomotor involvement. Given the 2-3 month timeline, prominent delusions, disorganized speech, negative symptoms, and grossly disorganized behavior alongside a strong family history and negative substance screening, the most likely primary diagnosis appears to be Schizophreniform Disorder. The chronic cannabis use since age 14 warrants a secondary diagnosis of Cannabis Use Disorder in early remission, though the severity level (mild versus moderate) would depend on additional clinical details. Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder could serve as an alternative if full diagnostic criteria aren't satisfied, with Schizophrenia itself remaining a consideration depending on symptom duration and course. 9)** - would apply if symptoms extend beyond six months

4. **Brief Psychotic Disorder (F23)** - less probable given the duration exceeds one month

5. **Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder (F29)** - another possibility to consider

The mushroom experience may have functioned as a trigger or precipitant for the current presentation. While mood fluctuations are present, they don't meet criteria for a distinct mood episode, making a primary psychotic disorder more fitting than schizoaffective disorder. Bipolar disorder with psychosis is possible but seems secondary to the dominant psychotic features.

**Primary diagnosis: Schizophreniform Disorder (F20.81)**

Secondary considerations include cannabis use disorder—likely moderate severity given the chronic use pattern since age 14, though current remission status needs clarification given the negative drug screen and no recent use. Other hallucinogen and cocaine use disorders warrant documentation based on the history. If symptoms persist beyond six months, schizophrenia becomes the appropriate diagnosis. ifier depends on timing - if he stopped within the last 3-12 months, it would be in early remission.

For my final answer, I need to be selective about which diagnoses to include. Schizophreniform Disorder is the primary diagnosis given the symptom duration and presentation. Cannabis Use Disorder clearly applies given the chronic use since adolescence, though I should specify the severity based on the number of criteria met. The one-time cocaine and hallucinogen use during a single trip wouldn't meet criteria for substance use disorders. I'm considering whether to list Schizophrenia and other psychotic spectrum disorders on the differential, but the most clinically relevant diagnoses are Schizophreniform Disorder with Cannabis Use Disorder as secondary.

1059,"A 16-year-old Hispanic female, immigrated to the United States two years ago from a conflict-affected region in South America, presented to the child psychiatry clinic for follow up evaluation and with recent complaints of frequent and severe verbal outbursts at school. The patient had a documented history of chronic sexual abuse and has also witnessed violence, both in her country of origin and during migration. She was accompanied by her biological mother. The patient presented for an initial evaluation six months ago and was lost to follow up since then. At that time, a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was made by the same outpatient mental health provider. The patient reported significant improvement in frequency and intensity of nightmares since started on medications six months ago. Re-established care because the school staff reported frequent episodes (occurring one-two times per week) in which the patient would become suddenly angry, shouting profanities and making personally hurtful comments toward teachers, administrators, and peers. These episodes were often precipitated by perceived criticism, sudden changes in expectations, or ambiguous social cues. Despite these outbursts, the patient was described as highly intelligent, academically capable, and frequently helpful to classmates. She was logical and articulate in conversations when calm but maintained a guarded and cautious interpersonal style. During clinical interview, the patient was initially reserved but opened up during the later parts of the interview. She endorsed persistent feelings of anger, mistrust, and fear, particularly in unfamiliar or male authority-driven environments.

**Data Extraction and Organization:**

Demographics:
- 16-year-old Hispanic female
- Immigrated to US two years ago from conflict-affected region in South America

History:
- Chronic sexual abuse (documented)
- Witnessed violence in country of origin and during migration
- Limited formal education prior to migration
- Previous diagnosis of PTSD (6 months ago)
- Lost to follow-up for 6 months
- Currently on medications (improvement in nightmares reported)

Presenting Complaint:

Triggers/Precipitants:
- Perceived criticism
- Sudden changes in expectations
- Ambiguous social cues

Mental Status/Behavioral Observations:
- Initially reserved, opened up later in interview
- Logical and articulate when calm
- Guarded and cautious interpersonal style
- Highly intelligent, academically capable
- Frequently helpful to classmates

Symptoms Endorsed:
- Persistent feelings of anger
- Mistrust
- Fear (particularly in unfamiliar or male authority-driven environments)
- Sleep disturbances: frequent nightmares, early-morning awakenings

Symptoms Denied:
- Hallucinations
- Current suicidal ideation
- Substance use

Assessment Findings:
- Average to above-average intellectual functioning
- No developmental delays
- No psychotic symptoms

Psychosocial Factors:
- Limited education prior to migration → heightened sensitivity to perceived failure/criticism
- Trauma history (sexual abuse, witnessed violence)
- Cultural considerations (immigrant status, Hispanic)

**Diagnostic Reasoning and Differential Diagnosis:**

1. **Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) - F43.10**


Her prior PTSD diagnosis aligns with documented trauma exposure—chronic sexual abuse and witnessed violence meet criterion A. The nightmares, though partially improved on medication, along with her guarded interpersonal stance and persistent anger, mistrust, and fear reflect ongoing re-experiencing and negative mood alterations. Sleep disruption and hypervigilance to threat cues further support this diagnosis, with clear functional impairment at school.

2. **Disruptive Moo**

d Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) - F34.81**
- Severe recurrent temper outbursts (verbal) grossly out of proportion
- Frequency: 1-2 times per week (meets criterion of 3+ times per week on average - wait, it says 1-2 times per week, which may not fully meet the 3+ criterion)
- Actually, the case says ""one-two times per week"" which is less than 3 times per week required for DMDD
- Age 16 - DMDD can only be diagnosed if onset before age 10, and she's 16 now with these symptoms appearing more recently
- This diagnosis is less likely

3. **Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) - F63.81**
- Recurrent behavioral outbursts representing failure to control aggressive impulses
- Verbal agg

The outburst frequency of 1-2 times weekly falls short of DMDD's 3+ weekly threshold, and her age of 16 with recent symptom onset doesn't fit the required pre-age-10 onset window. IED remains worth considering given the recurrent verbal aggression and apparent loss of impulse control during episodes.

Adjustment Disorder could apply if the symptoms stem from identifiable stressors like immigration or school transition, though the timeline isn't entirely clear. However, her existing PTSD diagnosis likely provides a more comprehensive explanation for the behavioral disturbance. Complex PTSD warrants further exploration given her trauma history. years old, and personality disorders typically aren't diagnosed until 18) - her symptoms appear more clearly trauma-related, making this less likely given the clear trauma etiology and PTSD diagnosis.

Considering ODD, her angry and defiant behavior could fit, but her outbursts seem reactive to specific trauma triggers (perceived criticism, sudden changes, ambiguous cues) rather than a consistent pattern of defiance. She's described as helpful with peers when not dysregulated, which suggests the irritability is situational rather than pervasive. For depression, while she has sleep disturbances consistent with early morning awakening, there's limited information about core depressive symptoms like depressed mood or anhedonia to support a primary MDD diagnosis.

The most compelling picture centers on PTSD as the primary diagnosis - she has documented trauma exposure from chronic sexual abuse and witnessed violence, with clear intrusion symptoms (nightmares), avoidance patterns (guarded relationships), negative cognitions (persistent anger, mistrust, fear), and hyperarousal manifestations (sleep problems, irritability and angry outbursts). Her verbal explosions at school appear to be expressions of PTSD-related emotional dysregulation and heightened arousal rather than primary conduct problems. A secondary consideration might be an unspecified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder given the school-based outbursts causing functional impairment, though this likely stems from the underlying PTSD rather than representing an independent disorder. The core diagnosis is PTSD, which remains the primary presentation. Beyond that, I'm considering whether complex trauma features warrant a separate specification, and whether the sleep disturbances and mood symptoms point toward a depressive disorder. The anger outbursts and defiance with authority figures could suggest ODD, though this seems secondary to the trauma response. There's also the adjustment component to the new school and country to factor in. I need to determine if the verbal outbursts are fundamentally part of the PTSD hyperarousal or represent a distinct impulse control issue that would warrant an additional diagnosis.

Looking at the anger pattern more closely, it could stem from PTSD's irritability criterion, or potentially reflect intermittent explosive episodes if they're truly separate from the trauma response. DMDD doesn't fit the age requirements. The most parsimonious explanation is that the outbursts are manifestations of PTSD's hyperarousal and emotional dysregulation. For the differential, I should list PTSD as primary, then consider intermittent explosive disorder if the outbursts appear independent of trauma triggers, anxiety symptoms that may warrant their own coding, and the adjustment difficulties related to the environmental transition.

Reconsidering the clinical picture: the patient has established PTSD with a clear trauma history, and now presents with school-based verbal outbursts. The triggers—male authority figures, perceived criticism, unpredictability, and confusing social interactions—all align with trauma-reactive patterns rather than primary mood or impulse control disorders. The sleep issues and persistent fear and mistrust reinforce the PTSD framework.

The most fitting diagnosis is PTSD, as it parsimoniously explains the full clinical presentation. While complex PTSD features are evident in the emotion dysregulation and relational difficulties, the DSM-5-TR recognizes this within the PTSD diagnosis itself. Other trauma-related conditions like reactive attachment disorder don't fit as well given her age and presentation pattern.

For the differential, I'm considering whether anxiety and behavioral symptoms warrant separate coding—the persistent fear and mistrust in certain settings, the verbal outbursts in the school environment. However, these manifestations likely stem from the same traumatic etiology rather than representing distinct disorders. The sleep disturbances and mood symptoms also align with PTSD's broader impact on functioning rather than indicating a primary depressive or anxiety disorder. I should weigh whether any emerging personality features or impulse control difficulties exist independently of the trauma response, though the evidence points toward an integrated trauma-based formulation. Since the symptoms have persisted beyond six months, the PTSD code should be F43.12 for the chronic presentation. For the adjustment disorder, F43.25 captures the mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct. I'm verifying the depressive disorder coding—F32.9 is appropriate for unspecified depressive disorder in the current diagnostic manual.

Adding unspecified anxiety disorder at F41.9 to the differential. For PTSD specifically, F43.10 is the standard code, though the acute and chronic specifiers can provide additional precision. Let me reconsider whether intermittent explosive disorder truly fits the clinical picture, since it requires recurrent behavioral outbursts with failure to control aggressive impulses as a core feature.

The patient does meet several IED criteria—verbal aggression and physical aggression toward property occurring roughly weekly, with magnitude grossly disproportionate to any provocation, and clear distress and functional impairment. However, the critical exclusion criterion is whether these outbursts are better explained by another condition. The aggression appears closely tied to trauma responses and mood disturbance, which raises the question of whether IED is the primary diagnosis or secondary to PTSD and depression.

For differential purposes, I should consider PTSD as the primary diagnosis given the clear temporal relationship between trauma exposure and the hyperarousal symptoms manifesting as irritability and angry outbursts. Adjustment Disorder with mixed emotional and behavioral features also warrants consideration, particularly given the stressors of relocation and school transition. Oppositional Defiant Disorder presents another possibility, though the pattern here seems more trauma-reactive than a persistent stance of defiance toward authority.

I'm also noting sleep disturbances that could suggest a depressive component, and while Intermittent Explosive Disorder could technically fit the recurrent verbal aggression, it's likely secondary to the underlying trauma response. The alternative framing using Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder might better capture the complexity of his presentation if I'm considering trauma features more broadly.

On reflection, though, if PTSD criteria are clearly met, adding Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder becomes redundant. I should focus on the primary diagnosis and the behavioral/mood disturbances that aren't fully explained by PTSD alone—the oppositional patterns and depressive symptoms warrant their own coding. Let me settle on PTSD as the foundational diagnosis, then layer in Adjustment Disorder with mixed features, Unspecified Depressive Disorder, and Oppositional Defiant Disorder to account for the full clinical picture. 63.81**
4. **Oppositional Defiant Disorder - F91.3**
5. **Unspecified Depressive Disorder - F32.9**

The core presentation centers on trauma-related symptoms with PTSD as the primary diagnosis, while the adjustment difficulties tied to immigration and school transitions warrant a separate code. The behavioral dyscontrol could reflect either intermittent explosive episodes or oppositional patterns, and there's a depressive component worth documenting. I'm questioning whether reactive attachment disorder fits given her early adversity, but the withdrawn, guarded presentation doesn't align as cleanly with RAD's typical inhibited pattern—PTSD better accounts for her relational wariness. Social anxiety might also be relevant given her fear responses in certain contexts.

Her anxiety in unfamiliar settings and around authority figures appears rooted in trauma rather than generalized social anxiety. The diagnostic codes check out: PTSD (F43.10), adjustment disorder with mixed emotional and behavioral features (F43.25), intermittent explosive disorder (F63.81), oppositional defiant disorder (F91.3), and unspecified depressive disorder (F32.9) all align with her presentation.","1.

**Differential Diagnosis Analysis:**

1. **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)** - F32.x


- Depressed mood, irritability, insomnia, tearfulness, and passive suicidal ideation all present
- Significant psychosocial stressors including cumulative losses (father at age 8, grandmother 2 years ago, recent romantic separation) and ongoing social isolation
- Neurovegetative symptoms of anhedonia and appetite suppression with resulting weight loss
- Physical findings like bradycardia and anemia appear secondary to nutritional compromise from depression

2. **Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID)** - F50.82
- Choking phobia creates avoidance of eating despite adequate appetite drive
- Marked weight loss and failure to gain weight with documented nutritional deficiency
- Chronic restriction of food intake without compensatory behaviors

The absence of body image concerns and negative structural findings on workup suggest the eating restriction stems from anxiety rather than weight/shape preoccupation, which could independently account for the somatic complaints and malnutrition.

3. **Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)** - F34.1
- Long-standing mood disturbance with interpersonal difficulties and irritability
- Possible chronic baseline depression with acute exacerbation

4. **Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood** - F43.21
- Recent breakup and ongoing stressors as precipitants
- Though the symptom severity and chronicity suggest a more entrenched condition

5. **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)** - F43.10
- Childhood exposure to father's death at age 8
- She denies current PTSD symptoms, though subtle avoidance patterns may exist
- The choking fear could represent trauma-related anxiety

6. **An Eating Disorder** - F50.0x
- Physical findings align: weight loss, bradycardia, iron deficiency, amenorrhea
- Lacks the typical body image disturbance or weight gain phobia
- The dietary restriction appears driven by choking anxiety and nausea rather than appearance concerns

7. **Somatic Symptom Disorder** - F45.1
- Unexplained dysphagia despite negative imaging
- Multiple somatic complaints without clear organic etiology
- Though actual medical consequences (anemia, bradycardia) complicate this picture

8. **Functional Dysphagia** - Could represent a psychogenic component within ARFID or somatic presentations

9. **Generalized Anxiety Disorder** - F41.1
- Prominent choking fear as a central anxiety symptom

The chronic presentation with multiple physical complaints and persistent anxiety symptoms suggests a complex picture. ARFID emerges as the most fitting diagnosis given the eating restriction tied to fear of choking rather than weight concerns, combined with documented medical consequences. Major Depressive Disorder also requires diagnosis given the passive suicidal ideation and depressive severity. The clinical question becomes whether the eating disturbance or mood disorder takes precedence—the eating restriction appears foundational to the presentation, though the passive death ideation prompted the referral itself.

Top diagnostic considerations include ARFID as a primary eating disorder with the choking fear as its core feature, Major Depressive Disorder with passive suicidal ideation indicating moderate-to-severe presentation, Prolonged Grief Disorder given the unresolved loss of her grandmother two years prior, and PTSD related to witnessing her father's death in childhood, which may underlie current anxiety even if not actively endorsed. passive suicidal ideation, low mood, irritability, insomnia, poor appetite, tearfulness, social withdrawal all point to MDD. The recent losses (grandmother 2 years ago, recent breakup) are precipitating factors.

The choking fear with significant weight loss, iron-deficiency anemia, and unremarkable GI/ENT workup clearly indicate ARFID rather than a primary eating disorder focused on body image. Anxiety symptoms center on this fear and its chronic course, potentially meeting criteria for a specific phobia. The grief from multiple losses warrants consideration of prolonged grief disorder given the timeline and impact.

Regarding trauma history—witnessing her father's death at age 8 and serving as primary caregiver for her grandmother over a decade represent substantial stressors that may warrant a trauma-related diagnosis even if full PTSD criteria aren't met. Looking at the depression severity more carefully, she maintains some engagement with activities like gardening and walks, suggesting moderate rather than severe depression. The passive ideation without active plan or intent further supports this level of severity.

The physical findings are particularly notable—significant weight loss, failure to gain weight, iron-deficiency anemia, bradycardia, and menstrual irregularities point toward an eating disorder process. These physiological changes, especially the cardiac findings, suggest ARFID may be a more prominent diagnosis than initially considered. The diagnostic picture includes Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Moderate; Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder; Prolonged Grief Disorder; possible anxiety related to choking fears; and a trauma-related disorder given her history. The choking fear is central to her presentation and could represent a specific phobia rather than just part of ARFID. For the trauma-related diagnosis, she denies current PTSD symptoms despite her history, so an adjustment disorder capturing the recent breakup and accumulated stressors might be more appropriate than a trauma disorder diagnosis. I'm also considering whether persistent depressive disorder fits better if there's evidence of longer-standing mood symptoms beyond the current episode.

Given her clinical presentation, MDD takes diagnostic precedence over adjustment disorder when full criteria are met, so I shouldn't code both for overlapping symptoms. The core diagnoses appear to be major depressive disorder as the primary mood condition, ARFID with the associated phobia component, and prolonged grief disorder reflecting her significant loss.

For additional diagnoses, I need to consider whether anxiety and phobia symptoms are better captured within ARFID or warrant separate coding. The fear of choking and eating-related anxiety seem integral to her food intake restriction rather than independent conditions. Looking at other possibilities—cannabis use doesn't appear to meet disorder threshold, but somatic symptom disorder warrants consideration given her multiple physical complaints and extensive medical workup. She presents with gastrointestinal symptoms, fatigue, and other bodily concerns that have prompted significant healthcare utilization, which could align with SSD criteria.

However, the anemia and bradycardia represent genuine physiological consequences of malnutrition rather than medically unexplained symptoms. The dysphagia itself seems functionally tied to her eating disorder. So my working list would be MDD (single episode, moderate), ARFID, Prolonged Grief Disorder, and possibly Unspecified Anxiety Disorder if anxiety extends beyond eating contexts. I should also examine whether her trauma history—even without active PTSD symptoms—might warrant consideration of other trauma-related diagnoses or if subsyndromal presentations are clinically significant here. stressor-related disorder given her significant trauma history even without meeting full PTSD criteria. The final diagnoses are Major Depressive Disorder Single Episode Moderate, Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder, Prolonged Grief Disorder, Unspecified Anxiety Disorder, and Unspecified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder—covering the depressive presentation, eating restriction, grief response, anxiety symptoms, and underlying trauma exposure. I need to verify the Prolonged Grief Disorder timeline requirements though, specifically whether the loss occurred at least 12 months ago and what symptoms have persisted since then.

The grandmother's death was two years ago and she was her primary caregiver for a decade, so the timing fits. She demonstrates difficulty reintegrating into her new living situation with her mother and appears emotionally disconnected, which aligns with several grief criteria. However, the clinical presentation doesn't provide enough specificity to confirm all diagnostic requirements—this remains a reasonable consideration given her history but may be somewhat speculative without more detailed assessment of her grief-specific symptoms versus depressive symptoms.

Considering whether Persistent Depressive Disorder might better capture her presentation since she describes ongoing difficulty and chronic struggles. The passive suicidal ideation and acute distress seem more consistent with a major depressive episode though. Without clear evidence of two or more years of depressive symptoms distinct from her current episode, double depression doesn't appear to fit. The primary diagnosis remains Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Moderate, alongside Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder, Prolonged Grief Disorder, Unspecified Anxiety Disorder, and Unspecified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder. I should also consider whether additional recommendations would be clinically appropriate.

The referral specifically highlighted her passive thoughts of death, which supports MDD as the primary diagnosis. ARFID is clearly documented through her clinical presentation. The remaining diagnoses serve as important secondary considerations for her overall treatment plan.","1. Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Moderate - F32.1

- CBC, CMP, BUN, LFTs, urinalysis, thyroid profile, B12, folic acid: within normal limits
- HIV: negative
- MRI head: unremarkable
- VDRL titres: 1:16 (POSITIVE for syphilis)

Critical Findings:
1. Hypoglycemia (glucose 44 mg/dl) - This is a significant finding that can cause altered mental status, psychosis-like symptoms, weakness
2. Positive VDRL 1:16 - This indicates syphilis infection. Given the psychiatric presentation, this raises concern for neurosyphilis

Differential Diagnosis Considerations:

1. Delirium due to hypoglycemia - The glucose of 44 is critically low and can cause:
- Altered consciousness
- Psychotic symptoms
- Weakness
- Confusion
- Bradycardia


This would be classified as a delirium due to another medical condition. The severe hypoglycemia is likely the primary driver of his acute presentation and needs immediate correction.

2. Neurosyphilis with psychiatric manifestations - The positive VDRL at 1:16 is concerning. Neurosyphilis can present with psychotic features, personality disturbances, and neurological deficits. An unremarkable MRI doesn't exclude this diagnosis, as early neurosyphilis may not show structural changes. Further testing like CSF analysis would be needed to confirm CNS involvement.

3. Primary psychotic disorder - While paranoid delusions and disorganized speech could suggest a schizophrenia spectrum condition, the medical findings here take precedence and must be addressed first before attributing symptoms to a primary psychiatric illness.

4. Anxiety disorder - His documented anxiety history may be contributing but is secondary to the acute medical issues.

5. Brief psychotic disorder - Could be considered but again, the medical etiologies must be ruled out or treated first.

Using DSM-5-TR coding, the most appropriate diagnoses would be Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (F06.2 with delusions or F06.0 with hallucinations), Delirium Due to Another Medical Condition (F05), and Major Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (F02.8x) if neurosyphilis is confirmed. His documented Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1) should also be coded. The clinical priority is identifying whether hypoglycemia or neurosyphilis is driving the acute psychiatric symptoms. d history of anxiety. If medical etiologies are definitively excluded through further testing, then an unspecified schizophrenia spectrum disorder could be considered as a differential.

The positive VDRL finding makes neurosyphilis a compelling explanation for the psychiatric presentation. Combined with the severe hypoglycemia documented at 44 mg/dL, these medical conditions likely account for both the acute delirium and psychotic features. The most probable diagnoses center on organic causes: psychotic disorder secondary to medical illness, delirium from hypoglycemia, and potential neurocognitive changes from neurosyphilis requiring additional workup to confirm. The hypoglycemia at 44 mg/dL is a medical emergency capable of producing altered mental status, confusion, and psychotic features. This acute metabolic derangement likely accounts for the delirium presentation, coded as F05. Given the clinical picture, the most probable diagnoses are: F06.2 for psychotic disorder secondary to a medical condition with delusions, F05 for delirium from the metabolic disturbance, and F02.81 for major neurocognitive disorder with behavioral changes related to the underlying medical etiology. The severe hypoglycemia is the most immediately life-threatening factor and likely explains the acute psychiatric manifestations better than a primary psychotic disorder. The secondary diagnoses would include delirium due to the acute metabolic derangement and possible neurosyphilis, major neurocognitive disorder if there's evidence of significant cognitive decline beyond the acute presentation, and anxiety disorder given the documented history. The key distinction lies in whether attention and awareness disturbances predominate—suggesting delirium with its characteristic fluctuating course—or whether psychotic features like hallucinations and delusions are the primary manifestations tied to the underlying medical condition.","1.
