2,"A black male in his early 20s with a remote history of depression as an adolescent and current cannabis use presented following an assault while incarcerated. He was found unconscious with mental status changes and brought to the hospital. Initial examination and work-up revealed right-sided periorbital edema and ecchymosis. The patient was arousable to noxious stimuli but would quickly return to sleep and was not interactive during multiple examination attempts. The emergency department staff believed there was a volitional component to his lack of participation in the exam, as he would push away from providers as they examined him or lie unresponsive. At one point, the patient was able to ambulate briefly while in the emergency department (although he ran into several objects) and tolerated an oral intake challenge with juice. Over the course of 5 days, the patient was returned to the emergency department by the facility four more times due to concerns that his mental status was not improving. The facility reported the patient was unable to attend to his ADLs. He was seen to be withdrawn, not eating or drinking, and toileting on himself or the floor. Additionally, guards (as he was incarcerated for part of his hospital admission) reported that he would occasionally speak to family members and staff. However, when he was offered paperwork to sign himself out of jail with an ankle monitor, he only gazed at the officer without speaking.

Urine toxicology was positive for THC and a negative blood alcohol level. He was found to have ketones consistent with starvation ketosis. Lumbar puncture revealed CSF cell count with six total nucleated cells present, <2,000 RBC, 54 mg/dL glucose, and 39 mg/dL protein. Meningitis/encephalitis panel for 14 common viral and bacterial pathogens and antibody testing for West Nile Virus was negative. CT of the head showed no fractures of the face/vertebra and was negative for other acute findings. EEG was read as consistent with a normal drowsy state. MRI of the brain, both with and without contrast, showed a cerebellar developmental venous anomaly but no acute findings. A neurology consult was obtained. His neurologic exam was noted to be variable, with poor participation despite repeated prompting, making full examination difficult. He responded to pain equally in all extremities, demonstrated no abnormal movements, had 2+ reflexes symmetrically, and normal pupillary response. Neurology ultimately felt that his LP, MRI, and EEG were unremarkable, and his symptomatology could be explained by postconcussive symptoms.

Once the patient was admitted, he was initially treated with a trial of Modafinil for suspected postconcussive syndrome, to which there was no response. On Day 6 of his hospitalization, when the psychiatric consultation service reconsidered his disordered behavior, psychomotor retardation, and speech with consideration for the presence of catatonia, the question of “volitional” inactivity took on a new meaning. There were numerous catatonia signs present to variable degrees: mutism, decreased oral intake, negativism, withdrawal, and decreased spontaneous movement. No automatic obedience, ambitendency, or rigidity was appreciated. ",Catatonia,case_reports_in_psychiatry,"**Clarifying coding for NCDs**

I’m considering the appropriate ICD-10 codes for neurocognitive disorders due to traumatic brain injury (TBI). I might use ""F02.80"" for major NCD, plus the code for the specific medical condition. For mild NCD, I've thought about ""G31.84,"" but I need to confirm. It seems mild NCD is categorized as a mental disorder, potentially coded F06.7. But given the user's preference for F codes, I want to stick to clear and widely accepted codes, like ""Delirium"" (F05) and others.

**Identifying likely diagnoses**

I’m figuring out the top five most likely ICD-10 codes based on the patient's data. The patient shows signs of catatonia, cannabis use, a history of depression, and had a head injury, so delirium or neurocognitive issues might apply. I’m considering the following:

1. Unspecified catatonia - F06.1
2. Cannabis use disorder - F12.10
3. Major depressive disorder - F32.9
4. Delirium due to another medical condition - F05
5. Dissociative stupor - F44.2

I wonder if major depressive disorder is as likely as delirium, since catatonia might stem from TBI or delirium.

**Assessing the patient's condition**

The patient is drowsy and unresponsive, which might indicate hypoactive delirium from a concussion or metabolic issues. Evaluation shows a drowsy state on EEG, but he can be aroused with noxious stimuli, indicating possible delirium or catatonia. Since he has signs of catatonia, that seems more likely, although delirium could still be a differential diagnosis. 

I’m considering catatonia's link to schizophrenia, especially given the patient’s age, but there’s no evidence of psychosis due to mutism. I might include “Schizophrenia, first episode, catatonia” coded F20.9 since catatonia is more common in psychotic disorders than in depression.

**Analyzing catatonia and potential diagnoses**

I realized that catatonia can occur in mood disorders, but without mood symptoms, schizophrenia might be a stronger possibility. However, since the vignette doesn't mention hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized thought, and the patient is mute, I'm having a hard time evaluating. Still, he can speak occasionally to family and staff, which shows he can communicate. 

His inability to navigate without running into objects might relate to vision issues or ataxia. Refusing to sign paperwork could stem from catatonia or be a voluntary choice. I’m considering ""psychotic disorder due to another medical condition,"" but I’m not sure. Let's review catatonia criteria: he displays signs like stupor and mutism, which could confirm the diagnosis.

**Formulating probable diagnoses**

I need to provide diagnoses using only F codes, focusing on mental disorders. Based on the information available, I can propose plausible diagnoses, including those not firmly confirmed. The patient shows signs of catatonia, current cannabis use, and a background of remote depression. 

I’m considering the following:

1. Unspecified catatonia - F06.1
2. Cannabis use, unspecified - F12.90
3. Cannabis intoxication - F12.929
4. Schizophrenia, first episode, catatonia - F20.9
5. Major depressive disorder - F32.9 

I want to ensure that the diagnoses are justifiable based on the available information.

**Determining psychiatric diagnoses**

I’m working on identifying appropriate diagnoses using F codes only, based on the patient's signs and medical history. The patient shows symptoms of several conditions, including:

1. Unspecified catatonia - F06.1
2. Delirium due to another medical condition - F05
3. Dissociative stupor - F44.2
4. Major depressive disorder - F32.9
5. Cannabis use disorder, unspecified - F12.10  

Given the evidence of a head injury, I’m leaning toward catatonia arising from that medical condition. It's tricky to confirm a stronger diagnosis without additional context, though!

**Finalizing psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm in the process of compiling a structured list of the most plausible psychiatric diagnoses based on the patient's situation. I think I’ll include:

1. Unspecified catatonia - F06.1  
2. Delirium due to another medical condition - F05  
3. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, unspecified - F33.9  
4. Cannabis use disorder, unspecified - F12.10  
5. Dissociative stupor - F44.2  

I need to be cautious about using terms like ""catatonic disorder"" due to the overlap with delirium. It's tricky, but I believe this set captures the primary concerns!

**Structuring diagnoses list**

I'm tasked with providing a structured list of psychiatric diagnoses and their corresponding F-codes without sharing my reasoning. 

For the primary diagnosis, I think I should go with:  
1. Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition (postconcussive syndrome) - F06.1. 

For secondary diagnoses, I’ll include:  
2. Delirium due to another medical condition - F05.  
3. Dissociative stupor - F44.2.  
4. Major depressive disorder, unspecified - F32.9.  
5. Cannabis use disorder - F12.10.  

This should meet the requirement for a clear, concise presentation!

**Selecting Diagnoses**

I'm focusing on potential diagnoses related to catatonia and need to provide a structured list. For the primary diagnosis, I think ""Unspecified catatonia - F06.1"" makes sense, especially given the context. For the secondary diagnoses, I’m considering four possibilities: 

1. Delirium due to another medical condition (postconcussive state) - F05.  
2. Dissociative stupor - F44.2.  
3. Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified - F32.9.  
4. Cannabis use disorder, unspecified - F12.10.  

I need to ensure these codes make the most sense based on the information available.

**Choosing Diagnoses**

I’m considering the plausibility of delirium in the context of head injury. For the primary diagnosis, I'm leaning towards ""Unspecified catatonia - F06.1"" due to indications of catatonia without clearly defined psychiatric symptoms. Four secondary diagnoses could include:

1. Delirium due to another medical condition - F05
2. Dissociative stupor - F44.2
3. Unspecified depressive disorder - F32.9
4. Cannabis use disorder, mild - F12.10

I need to ensure everything is clearly numbered, appropriate, and relevant to the scenario presented in the vignette.

**Refining Diagnoses Selection**

I’m focusing on the diagnosis of catatonia, considering whether to categorize it as ""Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition"" or ""Unspecified catatonia."" Given the context of a suspected concussion, I’m leaning towards the former. I can also include potential diagnoses like delirium, other specified dissociative disorder, major depressive disorder, and mild cannabis use disorder. 

The top five diagnoses should look like this:

1. Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition (suspected concussion) - F06.1
2. Delirium due to another medical condition - F05
3. Other specified dissociative disorder (dissociative stupor) - F44.89
4. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, unspecified - F33.9
5. Cannabis use disorder, unspecified (mild) - F12.10. 

Finally, I need to confirm everything is correctly prioritized and categorized.

**Finalizing Diagnosis Order**

I'm evaluating the diagnoses for the case, weighing how to rank them. I initially considered cannabis use disorder higher but ultimately focused on catatonia as primary, given its significance. Depression could be an underlying factor, while delirium may also be relevant. 

I need to finalize the list with ICD-10 codes, ensuring everything is precise. Here's the structured order:

1. Unspecified catatonia - F06.1
2. Delirium due to another medical condition - F05
3. Other specified dissociative disorder - F44.89
4. Major depressive disorder, unspecified - F32.9
5. Cannabis use disorder, mild - F12.10

I think this order respects the likelihood of each diagnosis.

**Evaluating Differential Diagnoses**

I'm analyzing the criteria for potential diagnoses, particularly regarding psychotic disorders. Catatonia alone isn't sufficient to justify a diagnosis like brief psychotic disorder since we lack the necessary delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech.

However, catatonia could indicate an underlying issue, possibly leading me to consider unspecific schizophrenia spectrum disorders. While major depressive disorder could have catatonic features, I don't have current symptoms to support that. 

Perhaps cannabis use disorder is more relevant given existing use. Finally, I might include delirium and postconcussional syndrome as potential secondary diagnoses with appropriate F-codes.

**Verifying neurocognitive codes**

I should check my knowledge about neurocognitive disorders in the DSM-5. For mild NCD due to TBI, the code I'm thinking of is 331.83 in ICD-9, but I'm unsure about ICD-10. It might correspond to ""G31.84 for mild cognitive impairment, but I'm not sure if that's right. Wait, 331.83 seems to reference mild neurocognitive disorder generally, not specifically tied to TBI. For TBI-related coding, I should explore ""S06.2"" as well, ensuring accuracy.

**Reviewing neurocognitive disorder codes**

I need to remember that the user specifically asked for F-codes, so I shouldn't include mild NCD due to TBI since it doesn't fit that category. However, I could mention postconcussional syndrome with the code F07.81, though that isn't in the DSM-5 either. I should check if the DSM-5 includes postconcussive syndrome as a type of neurocognitive disorder due to TBI, but if not, I won't include it. Delirium, coded F05, could be a better focus.

**Exploring dissociative and stress disorders**

I’m looking at different disorder codes. For dissociative issues, I see “Other specified dissociative disorder” coded F44.89. Then there's cannabis use disorder, F12.10. I could consider adjustment disorders like F43.24 or F43.25, but maybe not. Acute stress disorder, F43.0, might fit since it can have dissociative symptoms after trauma, but it needs specific symptom criteria. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) F43.10 doesn’t apply here either. I could look at unspecified depressive or psychotic disorders, but those seem off as well. I should consider ""Other specified personality disorder.""

**Considering mutism and related disorders**

I'm exploring the symptoms the patient is showing, such as mutism, withdrawal, and decreased oral intake. There's a suggestion of ""selective mutism,"" but that's primarily a childhood disorder (coded F94.0), despite it possibly continuing into adulthood. However, the patient occasionally speaks to family but not when asked to sign paperwork, which complicates things. That might fit criteria for selective mutism, but given the context of anxiety and decreased movement, it feels more like ""Catatonia."" Other conditions like ""Stupor"" or sleep disorders don't seem to apply either.

**Finalizing diagnosis codes**

I'm deciding on the primary and secondary diagnoses for the patient. My main choice is ""Unspecified catatonia"" (F06.1) due to the uncertainty surrounding the cause, even though ""Catatonia due to another medical condition"" could fit. For secondaries, I'll include delirium (F05), ""Other specified dissociative disorder"" (F44.89), unspecified depressive disorder (F32.9), and cannabis use disorder (F12.10). While I have options to consider functional neurological symptom disorder too, the primary presentation aligns more with catatonia overall. Formatting will be clear: each diagnosis followed by its ICD-10 code.

**Finalizing diagnosis codes**

I’m confirming the diagnoses to include for the patient. My selected diagnoses are: 

1. Unspecified catatonia - F06.1  
2. Delirium due to another medical condition - F05  
3. Other specified dissociative disorder (dissociative stupor-like presentation) - F44.89  
4. Unspecified depressive disorder - F32.9  
5. Cannabis use disorder, mild - F12.10  

I’ve ensured these align with DSM-5-TR standards and all codes are correctly categorized as F-codes. Each diagnosis is clear and properly formatted.","1. Unspecified catatonia - F06.1  
2. Delirium due to another medical condition - F05

4,"A 12-year-old male with no specific birth or medical history became concerned about lower abdominal distention and began reducing his food intake 3 months prior to consultation. He exercised obsessively according to his food intake. Although he was considerably losing weight, he commented that his belly was fat and did not want it to get any fatter. Body image disturbances and anxiety regarding being overweight were observed. During his initial consultation, he was very lean, with a body mass index (BMI) of 11.5 kg/m2. He also had sinus bradycardia with a heart rate of approximately 40 beats/min. We attempted to improve his weight with enteral nutritional supplements while identifying underlying diseases by head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and abdominal ultrasound. However, he became disoriented and was emergently hospitalized 7 days after his first visit. On admission, he was 145 cm tall, weighed 20.9 kg (BMI: 9.9 kg/m2), and presented with impaired consciousness with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) E3V4M6, bradycardia with a heart rate of about 40 beats/min, and slow breathing with a respiratory rate of about 10 cycles/min. Blood gas analysis and blood test revealed hypercapnia, hypoglycemia, and elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and transaminases. His movements were slow but not paralytic and his cranial nerves were normal. ",Anorexia nervosa with focal cortical dysplasia,case_reports_in_psychiatry,"**Analyzing conditions**

I'm considering the criteria for diagnosing delirium, which involves disturbances in attention, awareness, and cognition. There’s a possible acute onset within 7 days, but fluctuations aren’t explicitly mentioned. For OCD, the user exhibits compulsive behavior linked to food intake, which might be related to anorexia but could also be time-consuming. There’s anxiety about weight, likely tied to anorexia, but it might not be enough for a separate diagnosis. I’m also exploring other potential diagnoses, such as psychological factors impacting medical conditions related to anorexia.

**Determining potential diagnoses**

I’m exploring the possibility of F54, which applies when psychological factors impact a medical condition, but I’m not convinced it's the best fit here. I’m looking at the top five most likely DSM diagnoses for this case. My list includes anorexia nervosa (restricting type), delirium due to severe malnutrition or related conditions, OCD with an exercise compulsion, unspecified anxiety disorder, and possibly avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder or somatic symptom disorder. I'm weighing the relevance of these based on the symptoms observed.

**Evaluating possible diagnoses**

I’m considering whether the user might have ARFID due to a fear of abdominal distension. However, ARFID relates more to fears of choking or vomiting rather than distension itself. There could still be a fear of gastrointestinal discomfort. I’m also thinking about somatic symptom disorder related to preoccupation with abdominal issues, but it doesn't fit completely since there are multiple symptoms involved. 

That leads to the idea of listing ""Anorexia nervosa"" as the primary diagnosis, accompanied by ""Delirium due to another medical condition,"" ""Obsessive-compulsive disorder,"" ""Unspecified anxiety disorder,"" and ""Somatic symptom disorder"" to cover all bases.

**Examining disorder possibilities**

I’m pondering if somatic symptom disorder makes sense here, as it began with concerns about abdominal distension, which could have been misinterpreted as fat. However, body dysmorphic disorder isn’t a fit, and neither is persistent depressive disorder. 

I think ""psychological factors affecting other medical conditions"" (F54) is plausible since eating disorder behaviors could be impacting his medical issues like bradycardia. Still, anorexia seems to be the primary disorder. Ultimately, I’m checking relevant ICD-10 codes for a clearer view of the diagnoses.

**Finalizing diagnoses considerations**

I’m evaluating if somatic symptom disorder is plausible, referencing DSM-5 and ICD-10 codes. Although F45.1 is used for somatic symptoms, I'm considering ""Anorexia nervosa, restricting type."" I know I need to list five diagnoses based on the case details while avoiding unnecessary non-psychiatric diagnoses. 

The final consideration includes ""Anorexia nervosa, restricting type,"" ""Delirium due to another medical condition,"" ""Obsessive-compulsive disorder,"" ""Unspecified anxiety disorder,"" and ""Somatic symptom disorder"" to capture the complexities at play while ensuring completeness.

**Compiling differential diagnoses**

I need to create a top 5 list of psychiatric diagnoses for this case, including plausible differentials. Starting with ""Anorexia nervosa, restricting type"" as the primary diagnosis seems fitting. Secondary options could be ""Delirium due to another medical condition,"" ""Obsessive-compulsive disorder,"" ""Anxiety disorder, unspecified,"" and ""Somatic symptom disorder."" 

Even though questions about ARFID arise, the core concerns about body image lean more toward anorexia. The final list of diagnoses is straightforward and aligns with the guidelines provided.

**Finalizing diagnoses list**

I’m focusing on providing a structured list of the top psychiatric diagnoses related to the case, aiming for clarity without extra text. The primary diagnosis will be ""Anorexia nervosa, restricting type,"" with secondary diagnoses being ""Delirium due to another medical condition"" and ""Other specified feeding or eating disorder."" I want to ensure I present this properly with the corresponding ICD-10 F-codes. 

So, here’s my final streamlined list:

1. Anorexia nervosa, restricting type - ICD-10 F50.01  
2. Delirium due to another medical condition - ICD-10 F05  
3. Other specified feeding or eating disorder - ICD-10 F50.89","1. Anorexia nervosa, restricting type - F50.01

13,"We report on a 35-year-old female with a history of schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, and cocaine use disorder, with multiple previous psychiatric admissions, who was brought to our hospital's crisis unit after her parents called police, complaining that she had become aggressive and was “acting delusional” during an argument. According to her parents, the patient had demanded a DNA test to prove that her parents were not her biological parents and that her son was not her biological son. One week prior to admission, the patient's parents had reported her missing when she “disappeared” from their home soon after being discharged from our hospital following a similar presentation. Prior to admission, the patient's medications included lamotrigine, clonazepam, and long-acting injectable aripiprazole; however, her adherence to treatment recommendations was poor.

Although her parents claimed that she resided with them and her 2-year-old son, the patient endorsed a recent history of homelessness lasting several months. The patient said that during this period of homelessness, she had been sexually assaulted by a stranger in his hotel room. Collateral revealed that per court order, the patient's continued custody of her son was contingent on her adherence to psychotropic medications and inpatient drug rehabilitation. The patient admitted to using recreational drugs frequently over the past 6 months, including crack cocaine, which she stated she had used during the 1-week interval between hospitalizations.

During her initial mental status examination, the patient was poorly groomed, uncooperative, intrusive, and irritable. Her speech was pressured, and she described her recent sleep as poor. She commented that she intended to become pregnant and to sell the baby to an agency for $6,000. She made religious statements about “being fruitful and multiplying” and admitted to recently engaging in hypersexual behavior, explaining that “I have boyfriends on the streets.” She underwent testing for sexually transmitted infections, with reassuring results. She declined voluntary inpatient psychiatric admission and was subsequently screened and committed. We discontinued clonazepam at the time of admission, and we restarted the patient on lamotrigine, adding oral aripiprazole to supplement her long-acting injectable aripiprazole.

During her hospitalization, the patient faced several barriers to efficient psychiatric stabilization. First among these was her insistence on refusing any medications that might cause weight gain, including olanzapine. She endorsed allergies to haloperidol, risperidone, lurasidone, and lithium, with symptoms such as “anxiety,” “eye rolling,” and “facial twitching” in response to these drugs. Because she was adherent to oral lamotrigine and aripiprazole, we chose not to seek treatment over objection to administer a stronger antipsychotic medication that would also serve as an effective mood stabilizer. On hospital Day 4, the patient appeared virtually in family court, where she received an ultimatum to cooperate with treatment recommendations in order to maintain custody of her son. Nonetheless, she remained adamant about not being placed on “weight gainers,” stating that “I can have nine more babies. I want to be sexy.” On hospital Day 6, she tested positive for COVID-19 and was quarantined for 10 days on a medical floor. Her respiratory symptoms included cough and rhinorrhea, and she continued to display manic symptoms, including elated affect, hyperverbality, grandiosity, religious preoccupation, and inappropriate laughter. She exhibited behaviors suggestive of sexual preoccupation, such as raising her shirt during interviews to reveal a protuberant abdomen and repeatedly endorsing a desire to “stay sexy.”

After her quarantine, the patient returned to the psychiatric unit with her manic symptoms unresolved. On hospital Day 17, she requested a pregnancy test due to concerns that she might have become pregnant because she “had sex with a bunch of guys because I was homeless.” The patient seemed reassured when we explained that her admission pregnancy test was negative. We ordered a new quantitative β-hCG test, which was likewise negative. On Day 18, the patient received a maintenance dose of long-acting injectable aripiprazole. On Day 19, she complained of abdominal and back pain, stating “I've been in labor since last night.” She elaborated that “I can feel the head in my crotch” and “when I lay on my back, I feel the little hands and feet.” She also stated that her “water broke” and her “mucus plug broke.” The patient exhibited several physical signs and symptoms of pregnancy, including a distended abdomen, intermittent “pulsating” bilateral lower abdominal cramps, and sensations of fetal movement. In addition, she endorsed amenorrhea for the past year, except for some “mild spotting” three weeks previously. Convinced that her two recent pregnancy tests were “false negatives” and frustrated that members of the treatment team did not believe she was pregnant, she threatened to sue the hospital for failing to provide obstetric care. The patient lamented that “you all think I'm crazy, but I'm actually pregnant.” At this time, she displayed an intensifying religious preoccupation and stated that she was able to communicate with angels and “see Jesus.” She proclaimed that she herself was a prophet who could interpret the “auras” of hospital staff.

The patient agreed to a pelvic exam, which revealed a distended, nontender abdomen. The uterus was nongravid. The patient received acetaminophen and heating pads, and we ordered a transabdominal ultrasound to better assess the etiology of her abdominal pain and in the hopes of resolving her condition via additional evidence of nonpregnancy. At this time, the patient began to refuse all previously prescribed medications because she believed these would harm her “baby.” She did, however, agree to begin fluphenazine elixir, which we prescribed to address worsening psychosis.

When she arrived in the ultrasound suite, the patient offered the radiology technologist four million dollars “if you get this baby right.” She became euphoric while viewing the ultrasound monitor, exclaiming “That's a head, and that's a penis!” Her speech was pressured, and she perseverated on religious themes, requesting that all non-Christian staff leave the suite and instructing staff to “resist the Devil and he will flee from you!” She also demonstrated sexual preoccupation, recalling an experience in which she had “danced after I had sex” and exclaiming about the size of her “baby's penis,” predicting that he would be “sexy like his daddy.” After the procedure, the patient happily told fellow patients that she would soon deliver another child. She said, “I have been having contractions for 19 hr. When the results come back and they find out I am not crazy, they will finally send me to maternity.”

An on-call psychiatry resident presented the radiology report to the patient on hospital Day 20. She emphatically refuted the report, articulating a persecutory delusion of a conspiracy waged against her by the treatment team. She stated that the radiologist must have been “paid off” to switch her ultrasound with that of another patient. She continued to refuse medications that she felt might harm her “baby”; however, she agreed to an increase in her dose of fluphenazine. Following this dose increase, her affect remained labile, with frequent swings between euphoria and irritability, but she ceased making comments indicative of religious and sexual preoccupation. As our hospital is a short-term care facility, we decided to refer the patient to a higher level of care facility. On the day of her discharge, the patient told a nurse that “I don't think I'm pregnant anymore; it's all the shit I have inside me,” referring to her constipated bowels.",Pseudocyesis,case_reports_in_psychiatry,"**Interpreting clinical instructions**

The instructions are clear: I need to read and diagnose a clinical vignette and provide the top five psychiatric diagnoses according to DSM-5-TR. The output should include a structured list with ICD-10 F-codes, consisting of one primary diagnosis and four secondary ones. I can't add any extra details or reasoning—just the list of diagnoses is required. It mentions they want psychiatric diagnoses, but it doesn't specify that these must only be comorbid conditions.

**Clarifying diagnostic criteria**

I’m realizing that while the instructions mention “most likely diagnoses,” I could interpret that as including differentials. They specify a primary diagnosis and four secondary ones, implying actual diagnoses rather than just differentials. So, I should mix plausible diagnoses that could occur together, like schizoaffective disorder, cocaine use disorder, pseudocyesis, and PTSD. I could consider borderline personality disorder for its traits too, but there seems to be a balancing act between selecting comorbid conditions without giving reasoning in the output.

**Identifying potential diagnoses**

I'm thinking that I should include ""Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type"" and ""Cocaine use disorder,"" along with ""Stimulant-induced psychotic disorder,"" since they're interrelated. I need five diagnoses, though! I could consider ""Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic with psychotic features,"" but that's mutually exclusive since it overlaps. I might treat ""Bipolar I disorder"" as primary and list ""Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type"" as secondary. The vignette indicates a history of schizoaffective disorder with mania and psychosis, so I want to keep that. But still pondering other possible diagnoses related to cocaine.

**Exploring potential diagnoses**

I’m considering ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder,"" but it seems like it may not fit without PTSD symptoms, despite her experiences with homelessness and sexual assault. I thought about ""Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder"" since she was on clonazepam, but there's no mention of misuse. ""Alcohol use disorder"" wasn’t mentioned either. I’m also exploring ""Delusional disorder, somatic type,"" but it seems more appropriate to lean toward schizoaffective mania instead. There’s a possibility of listing ""Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum,"" but I need to focus on what truly fits. Antisocial personality disorder might be a consideration too due to her aggression.

**Determining final diagnoses**

I need to identify the top five diagnoses based on the information presented. ""Cluster B personality traits"" don’t fit, and ""Adjustment disorder"" isn’t quite right either. I considered ""COVID-related delirium,"" but there are no symptoms indicating that. I can explore ""Cocaine-induced psychotic disorder,"" and ""Pseudocyesis"" could be relevant, along with ""Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic with psychotic features."" I want to stay within the evidence given and avoid unsupported diagnoses. I'll compile everything into clear diagnostic codes.

**Identifying supported diagnoses**

Let’s review the possible diagnoses based on the case. I can confirm ""Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type"" and ""Cocaine use disorder."" However, a few options don’t seem supported, like ""Cannabis use"" and others. We noted that she has psychosis, ""Pseudocyesis,"" and her mania overlaps with these conditions. While I’m considering ""Stimulant-induced psychotic disorder"" or other options for the fifth diagnosis, it’s essential to ground these in the provided information. I’ll narrow it down to the top five supported diagnoses.

**Determining primary and secondary diagnoses**

I’m thinking that I can prioritize ""Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features"" as the primary diagnosis since it aligns well with confirmed mania and psychosis. While I also have a history of schizoaffective disorder to consider, I can treat that as a differential. As I finalize the top five diagnoses, I plan to include the correct ICD-10 codes to support my selections. Listing them in order of most likely fits my need to provide structured, precise diagnoses.

**Verifying diagnoses and codes**

I’m considering which diagnosis to prioritize, like ""Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar and Related Disorder"" or ""Stimulant-Induced Psychotic Disorder,"" but I need to confirm the relevant ICD-10 codes. I remember various codes, such as F31.2 for bipolar disorder with psychotic features. For cocaine use disorder, I think F14.20 is accurate, and F45.8 corresponds to pseudocyesis. I need to ensure we capture five solid diagnoses while maintaining accuracy in coding, considering overlapping symptoms. It's a tricky balancing act!

**Analyzing potential diagnoses**

I'm considering various ICD-10 codes for substance-related disorders, like F11.24 for opioid dependence with mood disorder and searching for the right mappings. I want to provide accurate diagnoses without reasoning details since instructions ask for a clear list. I’ll focus on primary disorders, likely using schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type (F25.0) as my primary diagnosis, followed by cocaine use disorder (F14.20), pseudocyesis (F45.8), and then bipolar I disorder with psychotic features (F31.2). It's a bit of a balancing act, but I think I'm getting there!

**Listing potential diagnoses**

I need to be careful when selecting ICD-10 codes for cocaine-induced psychotic disorder. F14.259 seems like the one I might use, but I could also consider F14.24 for cocaine dependence with mood disorders. I'm focusing on a structured top five list of diagnoses, likely starting with schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type (F25.0), and following with cocaine use disorder (F14.20), pseudocyesis (F45.8), and bipolar I disorder with psychotic features (F31.2). My fifth could be cocaine-induced psychotic disorder or stimulant-induced disorder, depending on relevance and accuracy.

**Selecting ICD-10 codes**

To avoid duplication, I think we can list cocaine use disorder as F14.20 and include stimulant-induced bipolar disorder if relevant. However, I want to consider including stimulant-induced psychotic disorder (F14.259). My top five diagnoses might be schizoaffective disorder, cocaine use disorder, manic episode, pseudocyesis, and stimulant-induced psychotic disorder or delusional disorder. I need to stick to widely recognized codes for accuracy, like F25.0 for schizoaffective and F45.8 for pseudocyesis. Let's make sure everything aligns properly!

**Finalizing diagnosis codes**

I need to focus on the five most plausible diagnoses, given the clear evidence of psychosis alongside substance use and other symptoms. My top considerations are schizoaffective disorder (F25.0), bipolar I disorder with psychotic features (F31.2), cocaine use disorder (F14.20), pseudocyesis (F45.8), and possibly substance-induced psychotic disorder (F14.259). I think it makes sense to include stimulant-induced disorders, but I want to ensure accuracy with the codes I choose. So let’s double-check everything to make a solid list!

**Choosing the top diagnoses**

I’m considering the appropriate diagnoses based on the patient’s history, symptoms, and the evidence presented. My top picks include schizoaffective disorder (F25.0), bipolar I disorder (F31.2), cocaine use disorder (F14.20), and pseudocyesis (F45.8). For the fifth, I’m contemplating substance-induced mood disorders or stimulant-induced psychotic disorder. Each diagnosis must align with DSM-5-TR standards, and I want to ensure accuracy. This process is crucial to establish the best differential diagnoses. I think I've narrowed them down well!

**Determining the appropriate diagnosis codes**

I’m deciding on possible diagnoses, especially looking at ""Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder"" related to cocaine. It seems I could use codes like F14.259 or F14.159, but I need to ensure they fit the DSM-5-TR guidelines. I remember that there's a need for specific F-codes depending on whether hallucinations or delusions accompany the diagnosis. 

I also think including both cocaine use disorder and substance-induced disorders is possible, but it could be redundant. The balance between specificity and generality in coding is crucial to provide accurate diagnoses.

**Finalizing diagnoses**

I think I want to finalize my list of diagnoses. I'll include ""Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar and Related Disorder (cocaine-induced)"" with code F14.24 because it captures the mood disorder aspect. However, I also want to include ""Cocaine use disorder"" with F14.20 just to cover all bases. The final list is crucial, including:

1. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type - F25.0
2. Cocaine use disorder (moderate/severe) - F14.20
3. Pseudocyesis - F45.8
4. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features - F31.2
5. Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar and Related Disorder (cocaine-induced) - F14.24

**Finalizing diagnoses list**

So, I'm thinking we should finalize the list of diagnoses while ensuring everything is accurate. I want to include: ""Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type"" with F25.0, ""Cocaine use disorder"" with F14.20, ""Pseudocyesis"" with F45.8, ""Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features"" with F31.2, and then for the fifth diagnosis, I’m leaning towards ""Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder (cocaine-induced)"" with F14.259. Let’s ensure everything adheres to the required format and accurately reflects the patient's situation.

**Determining primary and secondary diagnoses**

I’m considering the diagnosis list, weighing the patient's history of schizoaffective disorder against current symptoms. Given the strong evidence of mania and psychosis, I’m leaning towards ""Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features"" as the primary diagnosis, supported by clear observations. I’ll list ""Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type"" as a secondary due to the historical context. Other secondary diagnoses will include ""Cocaine use disorder"", ""Pseudocyesis"", and ""Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar and Related Disorder (cocaine-induced)"" for a comprehensive final ranking.

**Finalizing the diagnosis list**

I'm considering the ranking for the diagnoses, and I might place ""Cocaine use disorder"" second since it's a definite finding. The request is for the top 5 most likely diagnoses, suggesting a combination of principal and secondary diagnoses rather than strictly decreasing likelihood. So, my final list will include ""Schizoaffective disorder"" as primary and follow with ""Cocaine use disorder,"" ""Pseudocyesis,"" ""Bipolar I disorder,"" and ""Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar Disorder"". I’ll ensure all have corresponding F-codes.","1. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type - F25.0

14,"The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a psychiatric history of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), major depressive disorder (MDD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), dyssomnia, tobacco use disorder, and alcohol use disorder in remission. Her tobacco use disorder began at age 22, and she smoked two packs of cigarettes daily. At age 46, she decreased her tobacco use to smoking one and a half packs of cigarettes daily. Two years later, she further decreased her tobacco use to smoking one pack of cigarettes daily.

Her alcohol use disorder began at age 38, and she drank a pint (473 mL) of hard liquor daily. At age 45, she decreased her alcohol use to half a pint (236.5 mL) of hard liquor daily. The following year, she decreased her alcohol use to only weekends. Two years later, she used alcohol very occasionally. At age 49, her husband passed, and her alcohol use increased to a fifth (750 mL) of gin daily. She was hospitalized twice that year for chronic pancreatitis and quit drinking after the second hospitalization.

She struggled with worsening GAD, MDD, and PTSD since age 39. At age 46, she was prescribed citalopram but did not tolerate it. At age 49, she began regularly seeing outpatient psychiatry. She was prescribed sertraline and prazosin. A few months later, her MDD and PTSD symptoms significantly improved. However, her GAD worsened, and she had more frequent exacerbations. Her sertraline and prazosin dosages were increased. She was also prescribed hydroxyzine but did not tolerate it. Additionally, she received grief therapy as recommended. Her MDD and PTSD symptoms improved significantly more, but her GAD continued to be uncontrolled. Intermittently, she would be out of her medications, and her MDD and GAD would worsen. Her PTSD was stable, even when out of medication.

Also, the patient was prescribed melatonin for her dyssomnia at age 50. Her dyssomnia was uncontrolled despite increasing the melatonin dosage. She did not tolerate trazodone. The patient was then lost to follow-up with outpatient psychiatry for 2 years and returned at age 53. Since then, she has had regular follow-up appointments with outpatient psychiatry.

When she returned to outpatient psychiatry at age 53, she had been off of all psychiatric medications. Her MDD was partially stable. Her PTSD was stable. Her GAD and dyssomnia were uncontrolled. She had resumed drinking small amounts of alcohol on occasion, about once a month, and she continued to smoke one pack of cigarettes daily. Her sertraline was resumed, and she was started on zolpidem. Her dyssomnia improved with zolpidem. Eventually, her sertraline was switched to paroxetine. After trialing multiple medications, she was started on diazepam for a short period for her uncontrolled anxiety. Psychotherapy was also recommended, but she did not take part in it. In April 2020, at age 55, her outpatient psychiatry appointments were converted from in-person to telehealth due to COVID-19 health regulations.

At age 49, the patient first noted fatigue and poor memory. At a follow-up appointment a few months later, she continued to report poor memory. A year later, she reported worsening memory, resulting in losing her keys and forgetting important dates. After that, she did not report fatigue or memory concerns for several years.

In August 2021, at age 56, the patient had mild COVID-19, which did not require hospitalization. Since then, for a period of over 1.5 years, she has reported persistent symptoms associated with LC-19. At her following appointment in December 2021, she noted fatigue, breathlessness, ageusia, poor appetite, weight loss, and “not feeling right.” In January 2022, she also reported poor memory, increased confusion, and being easily distracted. She was concerned she had an unnoticed stroke that was causing these symptoms. In February 2022, these symptoms persisted, and she reported left-side weakness. In April 2022, she also reported anosmia, “brain fog,” and feeling disorganized. She stated she could not describe her cognitive symptoms with words. In August 2022, she also reported generalized weakness, loss of balance, dizziness, body temperature changes, and increased disorganization. She stated she couldn't go to walk-in psychotherapy due to her disorganization.

At this time, she also began experiencing significant impairments in her daily functioning. She reported difficulties with instrumental activities of daily living, such as cooking. In September 2022, she also reported trouble with word finding. In October 2022, she also reported concern regarding her sensation of touch and vision. She reported that things felt different, and she thought her vision “easily missed things.” For example, she would not have initially seen a trash bag and would suddenly notice it was there. In January 2023, she also expressed feeling unable to drive, although once she was in the car, she could complete the task. In March 2023, she noted not being able to feel her left hand and believed she may have had a stroke to cause this. Other than fatigue and difficulty with memory, the patient did not express any of these symptoms or concerns prior to August 2021.

Her social isolation, due to her symptoms, further exacerbated her distress. She reported excessive anxiety regarding the uncertain etiology of her symptoms. She frequently expressed concern that her physicians were not doing enough to diagnose and treat her. She requested a comprehensive work-up and hospital admission. She did not meet the criteria for hospital admission and was not admitted.",Illness anxiety disorder (IAD),case_reports_in_psychiatry,"**Considering possible diagnoses**

I wonder if ""Mild neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition (post-COVID)"" could be relevant. When identifying the top five diagnoses, we need the most likely primary one. ""Somatic Symptom Disorder"" comes to mind since she shows many physical symptoms and preoccupation. However, long COVID also seems plausible, especially given her cognitive symptoms and weakness. Excessive anxiety with physicians could suggest SSD, but if long COVID explains her symptoms, SSD can still apply too. Another possibility is ""Illness Anxiety Disorder,"" but she has actual impairments, unlike cases typically seen in IAD. ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder"" should also be considered due to her chronic worries.

**Exploring diagnosis possibilities**

Her anxiety might stem from the uncertain origins of her symptoms, suggesting health anxiety. Given her long-standing Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), which has worsened despite medication, GAD seems likely. ""Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent"" could contribute to her cognitive symptoms and fatigue, although it doesn't clearly meet current criteria. PTSD may also be stable but not present. ""Insomnia disorder"" is chronic, and I’m considering ""Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder"" due to her reported left-sided weakness and sensory changes. Finally, ""Adjustment Disorder with anxiety"" related to long COVID symptoms could be relevant since her symptoms have persisted for over six months.

**Evaluating diagnoses and history**

Symptoms of Adjustment Disorder typically don't last beyond six months after a stressor. However, if the stressor, like long COVID, is ongoing, symptoms may persist. Given her chronic preexisting anxiety, it's a possibility. I also need to consider ""Unspecified Neurocognitive Disorder"" among the options. I have to provide a structured list of DSM-5-TR diagnoses with F-codes. There’s a lot to parse from her history: she’s a 58-year-old female with GAD, MDD, PTSD, sleep difficulties, and a past of tobacco and alcohol use disorders, which she hasn’t fully met the criteria for recently.

**Assessing alcohol use and psychiatric history**

It sounds like she might be experiencing a mild relapse, but her history indicates ""alcohol use disorder in remission."" I could consider it ""Alcohol use disorder, severe, in sustained remission,"" although her occasional monthly use complicates that definition. The coding could be F10.21 for alcohol dependence in remission. 

Reviewing her psychiatric history, I see she's had worsening GAD, MDD, and PTSD starting at age 39. After a few medication trials and therapy, she returned at 53 with ongoing issues, resuming sertraline and zolpidem with some improvement in her symptoms. Telehealth began in April 2020 due to COVID, impacting her treatment continuity.

**Evaluating symptoms and possible diagnoses**

At age 49, she began experiencing fatigue and memory issues, which worsened over time, with significant symptoms manifesting after a mild COVID infection in August 2021. Since then, she has faced persistent issues associated with long COVID, such as fatigue, breathlessness, and cognitive confusion. She has high health anxiety and expressed concerns about the adequacy of her medical care.

For a top-five diagnostic list with F-codes, I believe primary should be ""Somatic Symptom Disorder,"" and secondary diagnoses could be ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder,"" ""Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in partial remission,"" ""Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,"" and possibly ""Conversion Disorder (Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder)."" While we should consider ""Mild Neurocognitive Disorder due to another medical condition,"" its coding might not match requested F-codes, since they typically use G codes.

**Identifying key diagnoses**

I’m diving into the details of diagnosing this case. For the mild neurocognitive disorder, I wonder whether we have enough evidence, as DSM-5 requires documented cognitive decline, which we lack. Instead, maybe ""Unspecified Neurocognitive Disorder"" (F09) fits, but still needs evidence.

We should narrow down to the top five diagnoses based on current symptoms. I think we can include ""Somatic Symptom Disorder,"" ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder,"" ""Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in partial remission,"" ""Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,"" and ""Tobacco Use Disorder."" Alcohol use disorder is in remission, but we can prioritize the most relevant ones.

**Prioritizing diagnoses and F-codes**

I need to narrow down to the top five diagnoses while ensuring the correct ICD-10 F-codes are used. I'm considering ""Somatic Symptom Disorder"" (F45.1) as primary, followed by ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder"" (F41.1), ""Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in partial remission"" (F33.41), ""Posttraumatic Stress Disorder"" (F43.10), and either ""Nicotine Dependence, cigarettes, uncomplicated"" (F17.210) or ""Alcohol Use Disorder in sustained remission"" (F10.21). 

I need to evaluate which diagnosis reflects her current symptoms best, given her history and long COVID-related health issues.

**Assessing psychiatric diagnoses**

I’m working on psychiatric diagnoses, focusing on whether ""Mild Neurocognitive Disorder"" might apply, especially given cognitive deficits affecting daily life. While there’s only concern and no objective evidence, F09 for ""Unspecified Neurocognitive Disorder"" may fit. However, the primary diagnosis may be ""Somatic Symptom Disorder,"" since long COVID symptoms seem to contribute to her cognitive complaints. I should finalize my top five diagnoses while ensuring they accurately reflect her overall presentation and symptoms, weighing their relevance.

**Determining psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm evaluating potential psychiatric diagnoses for a 58-year-old woman with a history of generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, PTSD, and substance use disorders. The primary diagnosis should reflect her current symptoms—persistent cognitive and physical issues post-COVID. ""Somatic symptom disorder"" might be fitting if her responses are excessive, but ""Mild neurocognitive disorder"" could also explain her cognitive difficulties. However, we need to prioritize diagnoses that best account for her current impairment, including anxiety exacerbated by her medical condition or long COVID symptoms.

**Listing psychiatric diagnoses**

I’m focusing on establishing probable psychiatric diagnoses for a patient with complex symptoms following COVID. Using the available information, I should prioritize five core diagnoses. The likely candidates include:  
1. Somatic symptom disorder (F45.1): affecting her with many physical symptoms and health anxiety.  
2. Generalized anxiety disorder (F41.1): her chronic worry seems evident.  
3. Mild neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition (F06.7): cognitive difficulties persist.  
4. Major depressive disorder, recurrent (F33.41): still affects her functioning.  
5. Tobacco use disorder (F17.210): it's active.

**Evaluating potential diagnoses**

I'm considering the patient's symptoms and how to classify them. The onset after COVID hints at possible unknown causes. While ""Unspecified neurocognitive disorder"" (F09) fits due to insufficient information, it might not be the best fit given her noticeable impairments. I think ""Somatic symptom disorder"" could be more relevant, capturing her cognitive complaints and health anxiety. I’ll prioritize the top five diagnoses: Somatic symptom disorder, Generalized anxiety disorder (F41.1), Major depressive disorder (F33.41), Nicotine dependence (F17.210), and consider Alcohol use disorder in remission (F10.21).

**Choosing psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm evaluating the patient's history and symptoms to determine her top psychiatric diagnoses. She has Generalized Anxiety Disorder, nicotine dependence, Major Depressive Disorder, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, along with a history of alcohol use disorder now in remission. While PTSD may be stable and less likely relevant, the somatic symptom disorder is new and significant. Therefore, I'm leaning towards selecting: Somatic symptom disorder (F45.1), Generalized anxiety disorder (F41.1), Major depressive disorder (F33.41), PTSD (F43.10), and tobacco use disorder (F17.210), excluding alcohol use disorder for this list.

**Selecting psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm considering the patient's history of PTSD, MDD, alcohol use disorder in remission, and current symptoms. It seems her PTSD might be minimal or stable, while her GAD and new somatic symptom disorder are more prominent. I need to narrow down to the top five diagnoses. I'll probably go with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Somatic Symptom Disorder, Insomnia Disorder, Tobacco Use Disorder, and Alcohol Use Disorder in remission. However, I might omit PTSD since specifics aren't currently described. It's a tough choice!

**Deciding on diagnoses**

I'm weighing the patient's diagnoses and need to choose the top five likely DSM-5-TR diagnoses. SSD is our new diagnosis based on current details, while PTSD is an old diagnosis that's stable. I could drop MDD, but its history still matters. Alcohol use disorder is in remission, but also relevant. I think I’ll prioritize SSD, GAD, MDD in partial remission, tobacco use disorder, and possibly PTSD. It feels more coherent to include the major diagnoses while acknowledging the patient’s substance history. It's a tricky balance!

**Choosing top diagnoses**

I need to provide the top five diagnoses based on the case details, including a primary diagnosis and four secondaries. The case highlights persistent cognitive and neurological symptoms post-COVID, significant impairments, and excessive anxiety. I could consider Anxiety Disorder due to a medical condition, but there's no clear evidence supporting it. Instead, I might choose Mild Neurocognitive Disorder due to another medical condition, along with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, to reflect her psychiatric needs. SSD might also play a key role, capturing the predominant issue presented. It's a careful balancing act!

**Deciding on diagnoses**

We need to finalize the top five psychiatric diagnoses based on the information we've gathered. I'm considering:

1. Somatic symptom disorder - F45.1  
2. Generalized anxiety disorder - F41.1  
3. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, in partial remission - F33.41  
4. Tobacco use disorder (nicotine dependence) - F17.210  
5. Unspecified neurocognitive disorder - F09 or neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition - F06.7

It seems that neurocognitive disorder is particularly relevant given the cognitive symptoms expressed. Although PTSD was initially considered, it may be less applicable given that her cognitive deficits might overshadow that diagnosis.

**Finalizing diagnoses**

To determine the most appropriate diagnoses, I need to ensure we have evidence connecting the cognitive deficits directly to another medical condition. Since we don't have sufficient evidence for that, I’ll opt for unspecified neurocognitive disorder, rather than provisional diagnoses. My proposed top five diagnoses are:

1. Somatic symptom disorder, persistent - F45.1  
2. Generalized anxiety disorder - F41.1  
3. Unspecified neurocognitive disorder - F09  
4. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, in partial remission - F33.41  
5. Tobacco use disorder (nicotine dependence) - F17.210

Considering the interplay of symptoms, somatic symptom disorder seems to be the primary diagnosis, reflecting her health anxiety.

**Deciding on diagnoses**

I’m considering the need to prioritize certain diagnoses. Major depressive disorder (MDD) might not be necessary if PTSD could replace it. Since the patient has improved symptoms, I can label it as “Major depressive disorder, recurrent, in partial remission.” The ICD-10 codes for these conditions check out. Finally, I've decided on the top five likely diagnoses based on her current symptoms and history:

1. Somatic symptom disorder, persistent - F45.1  
2. Generalized anxiety disorder - F41.1  
3. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, in partial remission - F33.41  
4. Posttraumatic stress disorder - F43.10  
5. Tobacco use disorder - F17.210  

This covers her significant health anxiety and maintains clarity.

**Finalizing Diagnoses**

I'm analyzing the vignette, noting that while it mentions worsening PTSD, it lacks detailed symptoms. Because of this, I'm inclined to include both PTSD and MDD as existing diagnoses. After considering the context, I believe the final list of five should include established diagnoses alongside a new one. I’m deciding to keep:

1. Somatic Symptom Disorder - ICD-10 F45.1  
2. Generalized Anxiety Disorder - ICD-10 F41.1  
3. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in partial remission - ICD-10 F33.41  
4. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder - ICD-10 F43.10  
5. Tobacco Use Disorder - ICD-10 F17.210  

This seems balanced based on her symptoms and history.

**Delivering Final Output**

I need to ensure I'm clear about the diagnoses and their corresponding ICD-10 codes. I’ve decided to include Tobacco Use Disorder (ICD-10 F17.210) rather than Alcohol Use Disorder since it fits better with the clinical picture. Now, I’ll finalize the output, making sure to clearly label one primary diagnosis and four secondary diagnoses without additional reasoning as requested. Here’s the structured list:

1. Somatic Symptom Disorder - ICD-10 F45.1  
2. Generalized Anxiety Disorder - ICD-10 F41.1  
3. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in partial remission - ICD-10 F33.41

15,"The patient is a 20-year-old single man. He is unemployed and has a history of polysubstance abuse and family problems. For the past 2 years, he has used alcohol, cocaine, and medical substance (Lyrica and other medications). He has a history of social anxiety with biological symptoms, which are unresponsive to medication. He expressed low self esteem and feelings of worthlessness. He was pessimistic about the future, saying, “I don't see anything ahead for me.” He described a passive death wish, but denied having any active suicidal thoughts. He described feeling fast heartbeats, blushing, trembling, sweating, trouble catching his breath, dizziness, and panic complaints, especially when talking to people and women in specific. He also described being unable to carry out a conversation with others, feelings of being watched and laughed at, and believing that he is ugly looking. He described having these complaints since adolescence. The patient has been an addict for the past 2 years. He started with Marijuana and alcohol, and then he tried several medical drugs.

His family's upbringing style is firm, authoritarian on the part of the mother, and permissive on the part of the father.",Social anxiety disorder (SAD) and major depressive disorder (MAD),case_reports_in_psychiatry,"**Analyzing substance classification**

I’m looking at the ICD and DSM-5 coding for substance use disorders. The DSM-5 uses code F19.20 for moderate/severe ""Other (or unknown) substance use disorder."" I'm checking the mapping and recalling related codes, like those for alcohol, cannabis, and stimulants. It seems pregabalin could fit under ""Other (or unknown) substance,"" rather than being categorized as a sedative. In clinical practice, F19.20 might capture those using unspecified medications. There's a lot to consider here!

**Deciding on substance coding**

I’m considering how to code the substance use disorder. F19.20 could represent the misuse of pregabalin and other medications, while possibly omitting cannabis or cocaine. However, since he did use cocaine, it’s significant to include both alcohol and cocaine in the assessment. He started with marijuana, but it's unclear if it's still relevant. To reflect polysubstance use accurately, I might note F19.20 while also highlighting his long-term use of alcohol, cocaine, and Lyrica. It'll be tricky to balance specificity and clarity!

**Considering substance use diagnosis**

I'm analyzing whether to include cannabis in the diagnosis. The user doesn't mention recent cannabis use, but there's a history with marijuana and alcohol. If it's not current, we might omit cannabis use disorder. However, since there's a polysubstance abuse history, I could still diagnose it if needed. I’ll include stimulant use disorder for cocaine, alcohol use disorder, and other substance use disorder covering pregabalin. This gives me a balanced list of diagnoses, including avoidant personality disorder or unspecified depressive disorder as the fifth. That fits the guidelines!

**Evaluating substance use classifications**

I'm considering how to classify the substance use disorders. Instead of saying ""Multiple substance use disorder,"" I can treat it as ""Other (or unknown) substance use disorder"" for medications like pregabalin, while still distinguishing between alcohol and cocaine use. I'm debating if ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder"" or ""Panic Disorder"" should be included since he experiences panic attacks related to social situations. The DSM-5 allows for specifiers like ""with panic attacks,"" but I might skip that. His feelings of being watched could suggest some social anxiety, but they don't seem delusional.

**Finalizing diagnoses**

I'm weighing the options for diagnosing disorders, considering if he meets criteria for Body Dysmorphic Disorder or other adjustment issues, but it seems insufficient. My current top five diagnoses are Social Anxiety Disorder, Alcohol Use Disorder, Cocaine Use Disorder, Other (or unknown) substance use disorder, and Unspecified Depressive Disorder. 

I could swap Unspecified Depressive Disorder for Avoidant Personality Disorder, since the vignette emphasizes low self-esteem and passive death wish, which aligns more with depression. I need to ensure I capture the most clinically significant issues while adhering to DSM-5 guidelines.

**Choosing appropriate diagnoses**

I'm reviewing potential diagnoses, focusing on depressive features like low self-esteem and feelings of worthlessness. Without explicit depressive moods or anhedonia, I can't diagnose Major Depressive Disorder, but Unspecified Depressive Disorder could work. I must choose between including Avoidant Personality Disorder and Unspecified Depressive Disorder in my top five. 

Given the patient's history of social anxiety, substance use, and depressive symptoms, I’ll prioritize Social Anxiety Disorder, Stimulant Use Disorder, Alcohol Use Disorder, Other Substance Use Disorder, and either Avoidant Personality Disorder or Unspecified Depressive Disorder to accurately capture significant concerns.

**Finalizing diagnoses and codes**

I've come to the conclusion that DSM-5’s code for social anxiety disorder should be F40.10. That’s simple. The other codes I need are for:  
- Alcohol Use Disorder - F10.20  
- Cocaine Use Disorder - F14.20  
- Other (or unknown) substance use disorder - F19.20  
- Unspecified depressive disorder - F32.9  

So, to summarize the top five diagnoses:  

1. Social anxiety disorder (social phobia) - F40.10  
2. Alcohol use disorder - F10.20  
3. Cocaine use disorder - F14.20  
4. Other (or unknown) substance use disorder (e.g., pregabalin/other medications) - F19.20  
5. Unspecified depressive disorder - F32.9

**Finalizing the substance use diagnosis**

For the ""Other (or unknown) substance use disorder,"" I’ll phrase it as ""Other (or unknown) substance use disorder (pregabalin/other medications)"" since pregabalin is relevant, but it's not strictly necessary. However, keeping it minimal while providing valuable context is crucial. 

To craft the final output and ensure it aligns with the requested format, I will go with:

1. Social anxiety disorder (social phobia) - F40.10  
2. Alcohol use disorder - F10.20

17,"A 39-year-old Caucasian male presented to inpatient psychiatry after initially presenting to the emergency department with psychosis. He had been found crawling in a parking lot with several feet of intestines dragging on the ground. The patient was only responding internally during the examination, and a urine drug screen was positive only for cannabis. He received an emergent exploratory laparotomy with a partial colectomy. He stabilized medically but became briefly catatonic on day six of hospitalization, which was resolved with intravenous diazepam. On day seven, he was transferred to the inpatient psychiatry unit on a voluntary basis.

On admission to inpatient psychiatry, the patient was fully oriented and able to recall stabbing himself in the abdomen because characters in his mind told him to, having an out-of-body experience as he watched himself pull out several feet of intestines. He felt compelled to follow the voices' commands because he had guilt about his history of sexual abuse towards women. He then recalls running out of his apartment and waking up in the hospital. He endorsed paranoia and auditory hallucinations for the last 10 years but never sought treatment. He felt hopeless, yet believed his potential was infinite. He had no suicidal ideation and expressed a fear of hurting himself upon returning home if the voices persisted.

He had never been diagnosed with a psychiatric illness or received treatment, but he did see a psychiatrist at age 17 after he was charged with indecent exposure. He recalled periods in his life when he had little need for sleep, had racing thoughts, and felt that signs and advertisements were speaking directly to him. His social history was notable for heavy cannabis use beginning at age 18. He was a daily user for 5-6 years and began experiencing paranoia and auditory hallucinations. Despite quitting for two years, the psychotic symptoms persisted, and he reported currently using cannabis 3-4 days per week. He also had a history of trauma and was emotionally and physically abused by his father who had alcohol use disorder.

On a physical exam, the patient had normal speech and appearance, an expansive affect, and poor insight. He endorsed auditory hallucinations of male voices that were commanding and feelings of paranoia.",Schizoaffective disorder,case_reports_in_psychiatry,"**Reviewing coding for disorders**

Okay, so in ICD-10-CM, F31.2 corresponds to ""Bipolar disorder, current episode manic with psychotic symptoms,"" while F31.13 is for manic without psychotic symptoms. I should confirm the DSM-5 coding as F31.2 for mania with psychotic features.

Then, I’m considering cannabis use disorder codes: F12.20 for uncomplicated dependence and F12.10 for abuse. Given the user's usage history, F12.20 seems appropriate for moderate/severe cannabis use disorder. I should remember that mild corresponds to abuse while moderate/severe aligns with dependence.

**Determining cannabis-induced psychotic disorder coding**

I can use F12.20 for cannabis use disorder. Now, for cannabis-induced psychotic disorder, I’m checking the codes. F12.259 might be correct, but is it for hallucinations or delusions? F12.159 corresponds to ""Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder with hallucinations,"" while F12.150 is for delusions. 

He has hallucinations and paranoia, so I need to choose the appropriate code. The DSM-5 specifies that I could label it as ""Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder,"" but I think it’s best to go with F12.159 for hallucinations.

**Selecting differential diagnoses for catatonia**

I'm considering ""Catatonia associated with another mental disorder,"" which is coded F06.1, possibly as a secondary diagnosis. I need to prioritize the top four differential diagnoses. 

My list could include schizophrenia (F20.9), moderate to severe cannabis use disorder (F12.20), schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type (F25.0), and bipolar I disorder with psychotic features (F31.2). 

While schizoaffective and bipolar I overlap, including both makes sense for differentials. I might also consider listing catatonia as separate since it's relevant, but I should focus on the top five diagnoses requested.

**Deciding on catatonia diagnosis inclusion**

I’m considering catatonia as it’s significant here, especially since he had a brief episode requiring benzodiazepine. If schizophrenia is the primary diagnosis, I could specify ""with catatonia."" However, since they want a structured list of diagnoses and F-codes, I might list ""Catatonia associated with another mental disorder"" (F06.1) as a secondary diagnosis. 

There’s also a mention of potential PTSD, but there are no symptoms described, so I can't include that. It seems best to prioritize catatonia here, reflecting its presence in this case.

**Evaluating psychotic disorder diagnoses**

I’m wrestling with identifying the most likely psychotic disorder. He exhibits mania-like episodes, which could suggest schizoaffective disorder, but confirming mood episodes is tricky. Considering his persistent psychosis for ten years, schizophrenia seems plausible, especially with hallucinations involved. 

However, he has elements of mania too. I need to assess the DSM criteria for schizophrenia versus schizoaffective disorder carefully. 

Ultimately, I think the best approach is: 
1. Schizophrenia (with catatonia)
2. Cannabis Use Disorder
3. Catatonia associated with another mental disorder
4. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type 
5. Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder. 

This way, I’m covering all the bases!

**Considering differential diagnoses for chronic psychosis**

I need to focus on likely psychotic disorders for someone showing chronic psychosis with some mania symptoms and heavy cannabis use. I have to consider options like schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar I disorder with psychotic features. Substance-induced psychotic disorder and cannabis use disorder are also in play.

While catatonia was present, it might not be a primary diagnosis since it seems brief. 

I might finalize the top five diagnoses like this:
1. Schizophrenia
2. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type
3. Bipolar I disorder with psychotic features
4. Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder
5. Cannabis Use Disorder, moderate to severe. 

This way, I’m considering both comorbidities and key differentials!

**Analyzing diagnoses for chronic psychosis**

I'm considering catatonia’s role in diagnosing schizophrenia. While it can be coded, it might not fit neatly into the requested list, especially since the focus is on DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses. I've got some solid options like schizophrenia, cannabis use disorder, and catatonia to include, as they are well-supported. However, filling the four secondary slots is tricky because schizoaffective and bipolar are less certain. 

I think the list may look like this:

1. Schizophrenia - F20.9
2. Cannabis Use Disorder - F12.20
3. Catatonia associated with another mental disorder - F06.1
4. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type - F25.0
5. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, with psychotic features - F31.2 

This keeps the most critical diagnoses right upfront!

**Evaluating psychotic symptoms and diagnoses**

I'm trying to untangle the timeline of psychotic symptoms here, which seem to have started around age 18-24 and persisted to 39—about 15-21 years. He reported paranoia and hallucinations specifically in the last 10 years, which might suggest a clearer onset at age 29. Heavy cannabis use started at 18, and after a brief period of quitting, it seems he resumed use.

From the details, I'd consider primary diagnoses of schizophrenia and secondary options like cannabis use disorder, catatonia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar I. Each diagnosis needs to be clear and supported by the evidence provided while being cautious not to overdiagnose. 

The relevant ICD-10 codes will be:

- Schizophrenia: F20.9
- Cannabis Use Disorder: F12.20
- Catatonia: F06.1
- Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type: F25.0
- Bipolar I Disorder with Psychotic Features: F31.2

This keeps it straightforward and focused on what was mentioned!

**Determining primary and secondary diagnoses**

I'm evaluating which diagnoses to include in the structured list. We have schizophrenia with catatonia, cannabis use disorder, and schizoaffective disorder as possibilities. There’s a concern about cannabis-induced psychotic disorder due to heavy usage; however, persistent symptoms after abstinence lean toward primary psychosis. 

The lineup could look like this:

1. Schizophrenia, with catatonia - F20.9
2. Cannabis Use Disorder, moderate to severe - F12.20
3. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type - F25.0
4. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic with psychotic features - F31.2
5. Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder - F12.159

I just have to ensure that all the codes fit the DSM-5 structure!

**Confirming diagnoses and codes**

I've reviewed the relevant F-codes for the diagnoses we need. For schizophrenia, it's F20.9, and F12.20 for cannabis use disorder. Catatonia associated with another mental disorder is F06.1. Then, we have schizoaffective disorder (F25.0) and bipolar I disorder with psychotic features (F31.2). 

Ultimately, I need to present these codes in a clear, structured format with exactly five lines, avoiding any reasoning to follow the rubric correctly. 

1. Schizophrenia - F20.9  
2. Cannabis Use Disorder, severe - F12.20  
3. Catatonia associated with another mental disorder - F06.1  
4. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type - F25.0  
5. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, with psychotic features - F31.2

**Deciding on psychiatric diagnoses**

I’m contemplating whether to include ""Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder - F12.159"" instead of bipolar I disorder. Given the patient’s symptoms have persisted for 10 years after cannabis use, that suggests primary psychosis rather than cannabis-induced psychosis. However, there's evidence for mania features that might support schizoaffective disorder.

After weighing these options, I think the top five likely diagnoses could include schizophrenia, cannabis use disorder, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar I disorder, and possibly catatonia as a specifier. I’ll finalize this full list of diagnoses with corresponding F-codes. 

1. Schizophrenia - F20.9  
2. Cannabis Use Disorder - F12.20  
3. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type - F25.0  
4. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic - F31.2  
5. Catatonia associated with another mental disorder - F06.1

**Finalizing diagnoses list**

I need to finalize the top five most likely diagnoses. My primary diagnosis will be schizophrenia, and the secondary diagnoses will be listed by their likelihood. I’m considering cannabis use disorder next due to its significance, followed by catatonia associated with another mental disorder. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type is also relevant, and I’ll wrap it up with bipolar I disorder reflecting the potential psychotic features. Here’s the list:

1. Schizophrenia - F20.9  
2. Cannabis Use Disorder, moderate - F12.20  
3. Catatonia associated with another mental disorder - F06.1  
4. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type - F25.0  
5. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic with psychotic features - F31.2

**Finalizing primary diagnosis**

I'm deciding on the primary diagnosis based on the most likely scenario. The patient's chronic psychotic symptoms have been present for 10 years, while episodes of mania are only noted as ""periods"" without treatment. This leads me to believe that a schizophrenia spectrum disorder, specifically schizophrenia, is more likely given the limited mood data. The patient has also experienced severe psychosis, including self-evisceration due to command hallucinations, which supports this diagnosis. 

Here's the finalized list:

1. Schizophrenia - F20.9  
2. Cannabis Use Disorder - F12.20  
3. Catatonia associated with another mental disorder - F06.1  
4. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type - F25.0

18,"A 39-year-old Indonesian woman complained of having had two seizures of 10-min duration. When the hand spasms are stiff, the eyes glance up, and the mouth is foaming and wetting the bed. After the seizure, the patient is unconscious. The patient had no history of previous seizures. The patient also has a history of SLE, diagnosed 5 years ago with high titer ANA and she received cyclophosphamide therapy. The patient had no experience of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, stroke, and tumor.

Her clinical condition showed facial and lingual palsy with central type on the right. Laboratory abnormalities included normochromic anemia (hemoglobin 10.6 g/dL, hematocrit 32.2%, MCV of 88 fL, MCH of 29 pg, MCHC of 32.9 g/dL) with slightly decreased platelet level (124,000 cell/µL), slightly decrease of albumin level (3.4 g/dL), the elevation of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (72 mm/hr), and slightly decrease of potassium (3.4 nmol/L). Meanwhile, PT/APTT, AST, ALT, bilirubin, BUN, creatinine, glucose, iron, sodium, and chloride levels were normal. Urinalysis examination showed proteinuria (+2), hematuria (+1), an increased albumin/creatinine ratio of ≥300 mg/g, and a protein/creatinine ratio of ≥0.5 mg/g. Blood gas analysis showed metabolic acidosis (pH of 7.34, pCO2 of 31 mmHg, HCO3 of 16.7 mmol/L, and base excess of −9.1 mmol/L).

Immunology results show an increase of procalcitonin (0.32 ng/mL), ferritin (427.6 mg/dL), positive ana test (ANA test ELISA index 392.66), low level of C3 (19 mg/dL) and C4 6 (mg/dL), elevated IgG anticardiolipin (91.10 GPLU/mL). Antinuclear antibody indirect immunofluorescence (ANA IF) positive using cytobead ANA with a homogenous pattern and cytoplasmic dense fine speckled titer 1/80 (Figure 1). In addition, the dsDNA test was positive (Figure 2). ANA profile was examined using euroline ANA profile three panels plus DFS70 showed strong positive for antinucleosome (++), antihistones (+++), anti-AMA-M2 (+++), and borderline for anti-RNP/Sm, PM-Scl100 (PM 100), and anti-dsDNA and negative for anti-Sm, SSA, Ro-52, SSB, Scl-70, Jo-1, centromere B, PCNA, and ribosomal protein (RIB).",Neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE),case_reports_in_psychiatry,"**Considering psychiatric diagnosis codes**

I’m thinking through whether we can code ""Other specified mental disorder due to another medical condition."" The DSM has F06.8 for that, but it seems like there aren’t any symptoms matching. F06.9 applies when symptoms are present but don’t fit a specific diagnosis. Though I wonder if we could associate seizures with a neurocognitive disorder, it seems better not to fabricate anything. So, it looks like I should provide a clear structure and say there's no evident psychiatric diagnosis based on the information given.

**Deciding on diagnostic coding**

I’m figuring out how to address the requirement for ICD-10 F-codes when there's no diagnosis. I could potentially use ""Unspecified mental disorder due to another medical condition - F06.9,"" but that feels inaccurate. Likewise, ""Other specified mental disorder due to another medical condition - F06.8"" isn't truly fitting. It seems best to indicate that no psychiatric diagnosis is evident, but I need to format this correctly. The user wants just the diagnoses without reasoning, so maybe I need to state that it’s not possible based solely on the given information.

**Considering diagnosis limitations**

The system emphasizes ""honesty"" and avoiding ungrounded diagnoses, so I can't force a diagnosis. I could say there's ""insufficient information for any DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnosis,"" noting that the primary issue seems to be epileptic seizures related to SLE. However, I can’t include non-psychiatric diagnoses. It looks like I should state ""No DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnosis can be made based on the vignette."" Since they request an F-code, I'm feeling stuck because I need to be truthful while also adhering to their requirements. The possibility of ""Dissociative convulsions"" arises, but it's still uncertain without more details.

**Analyzing seizure and symptoms**

I’m considering how there’s no previous seizure history, but the underlying SLE with antibodies suggests neuropsychiatric lupus, which could lead to seizures and psychiatric symptoms — though they aren't described here. The DSM doesn’t specifically label ""neuropsychiatric lupus,"" but it could manifest as ""Delirium"" or ""Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition."" I think ""Unspecified neurocognitive disorder - F09"" might fit, but since there aren’t any cognitive symptoms, it's a bit tricky. I wonder if the seizures with postictal unconsciousness could be categorized as ""delirium due to another medical condition"" instead.

**Navigating diagnosis codes**

I'm grappling with the F-code requirements and whether I could use F06.9 as a placeholder, but that feels inaccurate. The seizures could be neuropsychiatric manifestations of SLE, but DSM doesn't categorize them as mental disorders. While “Other specified mental disorder” is an option, seizures don't fit there either. Without cognitive symptoms, it seems I can't establish a psychiatric diagnosis. I should be honest and state that there isn't a diagnosis while considering the user’s request for a list; perhaps mentioning there's no applicable F-code is viable. But this conflicts with their instruction to avoid reasoning.

**Determining top psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm tasked with producing the top 5 DSM-5-TR diagnoses along with F-codes based on the user's request. However, I'm realizing that assigning a psychiatric diagnosis without symptoms is challenging. While seizures might point toward ""dissociative convulsions,"" there are characteristics that suggest they are more likely due to an underlying medical condition, such as SLE. Despite considering different psychiatric categories, none fit due to lack of cognitive symptoms or other defining traits. Ultimately, I think it’s best to respond with a statement indicating that there are no psychiatric diagnoses supported by the provided vignette.

**Clarifying psychiatric diagnoses**

I need to state that there is no DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnosis supported by the available information, and no applicable ICD-10 F-code. While I could consider various psychiatric conditions, it seems that none are a fit. The most honest response is to clearly indicate that there are no psychiatric diagnoses present. I might structure my answer to reflect that, potentially listing it as the first item, followed by placeholders for the remaining entries since the user requested five. Ultimately, it’s vital to maintain accuracy throughout.

**Summarizing psychiatric diagnosis status**

It appears that there is no DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnosis supported by the information provided, and no applicable ICD-10 F-code for this case. Though there may be conditions to rule out, the evidence leans strongly toward a medical explanation rather than a psychiatric one. The most accurate response is to clearly state that no psychiatric diagnosis is available and refrain from fabricating a list of diagnoses. Instead, I’ll present only the relevant structured response needed for clarity.

**Determining psychiatric diagnosis codes**

I’m trying to work through possible F-codes that fit, but none seem to apply directly. The request is for a top five list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses with their corresponding F-codes, based on a vignette involving seizures and systemic lupus erythematosus. It doesn’t appear to show psychiatric disorders, so I think the best approach is to clearly state that no psychiatric diagnosis exists and avoid including irrelevant codes. Ultimately, I need to focus on conveying that accurately.

**Evaluating psychiatric diagnoses**

I’m working to produce a list of five psychiatric diagnoses for the user based on the information provided, but it's challenging because it doesn't seem to support any valid diagnoses. The request requires F-codes, yet I’m struggling to find applicable ones, and it feels like I'm caught in a loop with the lack of evidence for a mental disorder. My best course might be acknowledging that no appropriate diagnosis can be made while considering creative options to stay compliant. It's quite the puzzle!

**Reviewing psychiatric diagnosis options**

I’m considering the task of providing five psychiatric diagnoses based on the user’s request and the given information, but it’s tough since there doesn’t appear to be a diagnosis supported here. I'm looking at codes like Z03.89 for ""no diagnosis,"" but the user specifically wants F-codes, which complicates things. Maybe I can suggest differential diagnoses that are low-ranked, but I need to be careful not to misinform. Ultimately, I think the most accurate response is to acknowledge that no psychiatric diagnosis can be made.

**Evaluating possible psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm trying to figure out if a diagnosis could fit here, with ""Delirium due to another medical condition"" seeming plausible since seizures can cause delirium. However, the case doesn't provide clear evidence for this. I'm considering Z03.89 for ""no diagnosis"" since it's applicable, but the user wants F-codes. Given the circumstances, I think I’ll present this single diagnosis while acknowledging the absence of support for additional psychiatric conditions. It needs to be organized and succinct!

**Determining psychiatric diagnosis**

I'm trying to assess whether ""Delirium due to another medical condition"" fits here, but uncertainty looms because the unconscious state may not align with typical delirium definitions. The clinical vignette indicates seizures but no solid evidence for delirium or a clear psychiatric diagnosis. I think the best output would be ""Encounter for observation for suspected mental disorder ruled out - Z03.89."" However, since the user requested five items with F-codes, I'm concerned this may not meet their requirements! I need to balance everything carefully!

**Finalizing psychiatric diagnosis summary**

I'm grappling with the best way to convey that the vignette supports no psychiatric diagnosis. My best output appears to be: ""Encounter for observation for suspected mental disorder ruled out - Z03.89."" The user wanted five lines, so I'm considering how to present that effectively. However, focusing on accuracy seems more important than meeting their request for formatting. I plan to keep it minimal, ensuring consistency and clarity while adhering to their requirements as much as possible!",1.

19,"A 50-year-old male from Nuwakot (nearby Kathmandu), married and unemployed, presented with a history of regular alcohol usage, meeting the ICD-10 diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence over the last 20 years. The Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) score of the patient was 30, indicating severe alcohol dependence. He had delirium tremens twice in the last 4 years. In the past, abstinence was prompted by a cultural factor (mourning of a brother) and a physical factor (pancreatitis). This time, the reason for abstinence was the COVID-19 lockdown. Following the lockdown, the patient was forced to stop alcohol due to its unavailability and inaccessibility. Due to movement constraints, family members had trouble getting treatment during the early withdrawal period. After three days of abstinence, the patient started having symptoms of agitation, decreased sleep, tremors of the hand and body, decreased awareness of the surroundings, visual hallucinations, and was hearing frightening voices. While having these symptoms, the patient tried to jump from the house (but was stopped by family members) and later inflicted a cut injury over the neck with a kitchen knife, stating that it was better to die on own than to die from others. A 3∗1 cm horizontal laceration in the anterior neck was sustained.

He was rushed to Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital (TUTH) for an emergency. He was attended by the emergency, otorhinolaryngology, and psychiatry teams. The mental status examination (MSE) at admission showed that the patient had psychomotor agitation, sweating, tremors of both hands and body, disorientation to time and place, impaired attention and concentration, impaired immediate recall, and recent memory. The Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment Alcohol Scale Revised (CIWA-AR) score was 45, indicating severe withdrawal. The initial investigations revealed thrombocytopenia (9 lac/cu.mm), alcoholic hepatitis (total bilirubin—1.4 mg/dL, direct bilirubin—0.6 mg/dL, SGOT—269 IU/L, SGPT—56 IU/L), hyponatremia (123 mEq/L). However, other electrolytes, random sugar, serology markers, urine routine examination, electrocardiogram, and thyroid profile were all within the normal range. The COVID-19 PCR was negative. The blood sodium level was normalized on the next day of admission. A provisional diagnosis of alcohol withdrawal delirium was made based on the findings.",Alcohol dependence syndrome; withdrawal state with delirium without convulsions (F10.40),case_reports_in_psychiatry,"**Considering psychiatric diagnoses**

I’m thinking through potential psychiatric diagnoses related to alcohol use. We should list the top five DSM-5-TR diagnoses. I'm noting things like Alcohol Use Disorder and Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium, as well as Alcohol-Induced Psychotic Disorder, where hallucinations may occur. However, we also need to consider delirium caused by medical conditions. With hyponatremia involved, which can lead to delirium, it complicates the diagnosis. This situation has many layers to think through!

**Outlining withdrawal diagnoses**

I'm analyzing a situation where withdrawal signs began after three days of abstinence, which fits the typical timeline. The primary concern is alcohol withdrawal delirium. We can consider ""Delirium due to another medical condition” as a differential, but that’s not alcohol-induced, and I need to use the F code properly. 

Listing probable diagnoses, I think the first is Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium, potentially coded as F10.231 in ICD-10. That matches what we see: alcohol dependence with withdrawal delirium. Sounds reasonable!

**Identifying alcohol-related diagnoses**

I'm sorting through alcohol-related diagnoses and deciding on codes. According to the ICD-10, F10.4 refers to withdrawal state with delirium, which is simpler and well-recognized, so I think I'll use that. 

Next is Alcohol Dependence Syndrome (F10.2). Alcohol withdrawal state is not uncomplicated here, since we have delirium. I could note ""Psychotic disorder due to alcohol"" (F10.5) as a differential, but it seems less likely. There’s also the idea of ""Unspecified neurocognitive disorder"" due to chronic alcohol, but the memory issues seem more linked to delirium right now. It's quite complex!

**Finalizing possible diagnoses**

I’m thinking about diagnosing based on alcohol-related issues. So, I’ll consider ""Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium"" as the primary diagnosis. Then there’s ""Severe Alcohol Use Disorder"" as a secondary option. I can also think about ""Delirium due to another medical condition"" like hyponatremia as a rule-out. 

I'm including ""Alcohol-Induced Psychotic Disorder"" with hallucinations as another differential. It seems like we have to keep it plausible with the limited info I have, avoiding anything fabricated. It’s all so intricate!

**Identifying possible diagnoses**

I’m reviewing possible diagnoses for a patient with severe alcohol dependence who attempted suicide. First, I consider ""Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium"" as the primary diagnosis. 

Next would be ""Severe Alcohol Use Disorder."" I could also consider ""Alcohol-Induced Psychotic Disorder,"" but the hallucinations don't fit perfectly here. 

Then there's ""Delirium due to another medical condition,"" like hyponatremia, which is a possible rule-out. Including ""Other specified alcohol-induced disorder"" might work too. It's a lot to sift through, but I need to stay focused!

**Outlining DSM-5-TR diagnoses**

I need to ensure that the diagnoses I choose are psychiatric and have corresponding F-codes. My primary pick is ""Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium"" with F10.4 or F10.231. Next is ""Severe Alcohol Use Disorder"" or F10.20. For possible psychosis, I’ll consider ""Alcohol-Induced Psychotic Disorder"" with hallucinations, F10.5, and also ""Delirium due to another medical condition,"" like hyponatremia, F05.

Lastly, I’m debating whether to include ""Alcohol-Induced Depressive Disorder,"" but I need to make sure it fits with the details of the case.

**Compiling top psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm trying to determine the top five psychiatric diagnoses for the case. The primary diagnosis will be ""Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium"" with code F10.231. Next, I'll include ""Severe Alcohol Use Disorder"" as F10.20. For possible hallucinations and psychosis, I want to add ""Alcohol-Induced Psychotic Disorder"" with hallucinations, maybe as F10.5, along with ""Delirium due to another medical condition,"" like hyponatremia, coded as F05. Lastly, I'm looking at including an unspecified psychotic disorder as another option, but keeping in mind that this should be based on the symptoms presented.

**Listing psychiatric diagnoses and codes**

I need to provide a structured list of psychiatric diagnoses along with their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes. 

1. Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium - ICD-10 F10.231 
2. Alcohol Use Disorder, severe - F10.20 
3. Alcohol-Induced Psychotic Disorder, with hallucinations - F10.5 
4. Delirium due to another medical condition - F05 
5. Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder - F29 

It's important to ensure these correspond to DSM-5-TR diagnostic criteria while using the appropriate ICD-10 codes.

**Determining psychiatric diagnoses**

I need to identify the top five psychiatric diagnoses along with their corresponding ICD-10 codes. For the primary diagnosis, I can list ""Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium"" with an F10.231 code. As a secondary diagnosis, ""Alcohol Use Disorder, severe"" can be coded F10.20. 

I can consider ""Delirium due to another medical condition""—like hyponatremia—with code F05. Lastly, I might include ""Unspecified Psychotic Disorder"" coded as F29 as a differential, although it's less likely. Let’s confirm these align with the patient's situation for accuracy.

**Assessing alcohol-related diagnoses**

I need to finalize a list of top diagnoses and their corresponding ICD-10 codes. For alcohol withdrawal delirium, I can use F10.231 as primary. Then, for severe alcohol use disorder, I'll use F10.20 as a secondary diagnosis. Additionally, I can consider ""Alcohol-Induced Psychotic Disorder"" with a code like F10.251. I should confirm that F10.4 isn’t a valid ICD-10-CM code, but might be acceptable in WHO classifications. Overall, it’s important to ensure the codes align with DSM-5-TR, confirming accuracy.

**Clarifying potential diagnoses**

I'm analyzing possible diagnoses for a patient with alcohol-related issues. Starting with the primary diagnosis of Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium (F10.231), I also look at Alcohol Use Disorder (F10.20) and consider including Alcohol Withdrawal with perceptual disturbances (F10.232). 

I think I need to confirm if Alcohol-induced Psychotic Disorder (F10.251) is appropriate, given the patient's hallucinations occur during delirium. However, it might be better to focus on Withdrawal related symptoms. I’m settling on a list that balances support from symptoms and diagnostic criteria.

**Finalizing diagnosis codes**

I'm refining the list of potential diagnoses, ensuring they align with DSM-5-TR criteria. For Delirium due to Another Medical Condition, I'll use code F05, while for Unspecified Psychotic Disorder, F29 fits. I’m considering that Brief Psychotic Disorder is less suitable since it requires sudden onset lasting under a month.

Confirming the codes, F10.231 for Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium works since the patient meets alcohol dependence criteria. Alcohol-induced psychotic disorder will be coded as F10.251 for hallucinations. This pattern looks correct!","1. Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium (delirium tremens) - F10.231  
2. Alcohol Use Disorder, severe - F10.20  
3. Delirium due to Another Medical Condition (e.g., hyponatremia) - F05

20,"A 40-year-old male, separated, non-skilled worker from Dhading presented with a history of alcohol consumption for around 20 years and met the criteria for alcohol dependence syndrome for the last 10 years. His AUDIT score was 24, indicating moderate to severe alcohol dependence. The patient's usual work was disrupted as a result of COVID-19, causing his alcohol relapse. The patient drank alcohol from local neighborhood stores. As a result of the COVID-19 lockdown, shop owners stopped preparing and selling alcohol entirely, resulting in forced abstinence. Following two days of abstinence, he began to claim that the 10–15 individuals were after him and were planning to hurt him. In full consciousness, the patient could hear these voices. The patient fled to hide at a relative's residence nearby. Later, the patient inflicted a cut injury with a kitchen knife, claiming that his act would hold those who followed him accountable for his death. Unlike in the previous case, symptoms arose while the patient was conscious and able to recall all of the events. A 4∗1 cm cut in the anteriolateral neck was sustained.

At the time of admission, the MSE showed that the patient was restless, had tremors of the hands and body, was sweating, was oriented to time, place, and person, his attention and concentration were intact, and his CIWA-AR score was 35, indicating severe withdrawal. The initial investigations revealed alcoholic hepatitis (total bilirubin—1.8 mg/dL, SGOT—356 IU/L, SGPT—231 IU/L), Hypokalemia (3.3 mEq/L), USG abdomen and pelvis showed-moderate fatty liver. However, other electrolytes, random sugar, serology markers, urine routine examination, electrocardiogram, and thyroid profile were all within the normal range. The COVID-19 PCR was negative.",Alcohol Dependence Syndrome — Psychotic Disorder: Mixed: hallucination and delusion (F10.56),case_reports_in_psychiatry,"**Considering diagnoses for alcohol dependence**

I’m trying to determine the top 5 diagnoses for ""alcohol dependence syndrome,"" possibly ICD-10 F10.2. A primary diagnosis could be ""alcohol use disorder, severe,"" considering it meets criteria in DSM-5-TR and has been present for the last 10 years. I’m weighing the F codes — F10.20 for uncomplicated dependence might be preferred. They specifically mention not including non-psychiatric diagnoses, so I need to choose carefully among the relevant F codes, like potentially including ""alcohol withdrawal with psychotic symptoms"" as a secondary diagnosis.

**Exploring alcohol-induced disorders**

I'm considering ""alcohol-induced psychotic disorder"" with hallucinations and delusions that began during withdrawal. It should meet DSM criteria, where these symptoms develop during or soon after intoxication or withdrawal, and they can't be better explained by a primary psychotic disorder. If symptoms occur exclusively during withdrawal, we could go with ""alcohol withdrawal with perceptual disturbances."" But if the psychosis stands out significantly, then ""alcohol-induced psychotic disorder"" might be appropriate, especially since the individual has severe withdrawal symptoms and is oriented.

**Analyzing primary diagnoses for psychosis**

I'm considering the primary diagnosis since the main issue is psychosis with withdrawal. According to DSM criteria, I could diagnose both alcohol withdrawal and alcohol-induced psychotic disorder if criteria for both are met. However, I’m unsure since hallucinations are part of withdrawal criteria, but delusions are not typically included. His prominent paranoia suggests possible ""alcohol-induced psychotic disorder"" (or alcoholic hallucinosis), characterized by hallucinations and delusions that occur during heavy use or shortly after, while maintaining a clear sensorium for days or weeks.

**Clarifying diagnosis codes for psychotic disorders**

I'm distinguishing this case from delirium tremens since symptoms began two days after stopping alcohol, with signs like tremors and restlessness. This suggests ""alcoholic hallucinosis"" related to withdrawal. For primary diagnosis, I might go with ""alcohol-induced psychotic disorder"" with hallucinations and delusions. The ICD-10 codes are a bit tricky—F10.5 is for ""psychotic disorder,"" while the DSM-5 aligns with F10.951 for the alcohol-induced type. I may also consider using F10.23 or F10.3 to meet their needs for F-codes.

**Formulating top diagnoses for the case**

I need to assess top diagnoses based on the case details of a 40-year-old male with a long history of alcohol use. He experienced severe withdrawal symptoms, including hallucinations and delirium. I’m considering “Alcohol-induced psychotic disorder” as a primary diagnosis, along with corresponding ICD-10 codes. It seems appropriate to include ""Alcohol withdrawal with perceptual disturbances"" as a secondary diagnosis, along with ""Severe alcohol use disorder."" I could also consider ""Substance-induced psychotic disorder."" While I'm differentiating between diagnoses, I want to ensure these align and express the complexities of his condition accurately.

**Selecting appropriate diagnoses and codes**

I’m carefully considering the diagnoses for this case, which includes severe alcohol use disorder, withdrawal symptoms, and psychotic features. The primary diagnosis could be “Alcohol withdrawal with perceptual disturbances,"" while secondary ones might include “Alcohol use disorder, severe” and “Alcohol-induced psychotic disorder.” I have to select five top diagnoses and find the right ICD-10 codes to match. It seems best to focus on what's most pertinent, like F10.232 for alcohol withdrawal with perceptual disturbances. As I move forward, I want to ensure my choices align with the user’s request for specificity.

**Determining primary and secondary diagnoses**

I’m trying to clarify the diagnosis for this case. The DSM defines alcohol use disorder and alcohol withdrawal as distinct yet related, allowing for both to be diagnosed. The primary focus appears to be on either “Alcohol withdrawal with perceptual disturbances” or “Alcohol-induced psychotic disorder.” Given the severe withdrawal symptoms and notable psychotic features, I think I should prioritize the diagnosis based on the prominence of these symptoms. I’ll need to prioritize carefully, ensuring I capture both the dependence and acute withdrawal aspects clearly in the codes.

**Assessing diagnoses for alcohol-related disorders**

I’m evaluating the DSM criteria for alcohol withdrawal and alcohol-induced psychotic disorder. The patient clearly meets the criteria for alcohol withdrawal based on several symptoms following cessation. The key diagnosis could be ""Alcohol withdrawal with perceptual disturbances"" due to hallucinations. However, he also shows signs of an alcohol-induced psychotic disorder that requires juggling the symptoms' severity and context. Ultimately, I will define a primary diagnosis, secondary options, and their corresponding ICD-10 codes, ensuring a comprehensive overview.

**Analyzing ICD-10 codes for alcohol-related disorders**

I’m working through the ICD-10 codes related to alcohol use and psychosis. F10.1 represents alcohol abuse, F10.2 indicates dependence, and specific sub-codes detail conditions like intoxication or withdrawal. For alcohol-induced psychotic disorder, I suspect F10.259 could be the correct code, as it encompasses this category. I need to ensure I select codes that are accurate yet broad enough to describe the patient's condition properly. I'll finalize the top diagnoses and codes, prioritizing clarity and specificity.

**Evaluating potential diagnoses**

I'm assessing possible diagnoses, including the ""Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder,"" coded as F29. This could indicate unspecified psychosis, but I need to ensure I provide exactly five. The patient’s history of self-harm complicates things, leading me to consider major depressive disorders, adjustment disorders, and alcohol dependence. 

For the top five, I’m leaning towards:

1. Alcohol withdrawal with perceptual disturbances (F10.232),
2. Severe alcohol use disorder (F10.20),
3. Alcohol-induced psychotic disorder (F10.259),
4. Alcohol withdrawal delirium (F10.231), 
5. Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum disorder (F29). 

I must ensure the selected codes reflect the patient's condition accurately.

**Structuring psychiatric diagnoses**

I need to ensure that I include only psychiatric diagnoses and not non-psychiatric ones, like hypokalemia or alcoholic hepatitis. I want a structured list of five psychiatric diagnoses with their ICD-10 F-codes. The names must align with the DSM-5-TR. 

So, here's my proposed lineup:

1. Alcohol withdrawal with perceptual disturbances - F10.232
2. Severe alcohol use disorder - F10.20
3. Alcohol-induced psychotic disorder with hallucinations - F10.251
4. Alcohol withdrawal delirium - F10.231
5. Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder - F29

I'll confirm that all these codes align with the ICD-10-CM.

**Clarifying diagnoses list**

The user asked for a list of diagnoses with the top five included. I realize it's fine to mention all relevant diagnoses, including “Alcohol use disorder, severe, in withdrawal,” while considering the DSM classifications. It might be helpful to specifically list both the general diagnosis and the withdrawal aspect, as it provides a clearer picture. Being thorough ensures that the user has all the information they need.","1. Alcohol withdrawal, with perceptual disturbances - ICD-10 F10.232

21,"Our patient, a 16-year-old male with a remote history of rigid thinking, dyslexia, possible auditory processing challenges, and subtle difficulties with math in early childhood, presented to the children's hospital with a 10-month history of abrupt onset and progressively worsening symptoms of marked anger, aggressive behavior, obsessions, intrusive homicidal thoughts, intrusive thoughts about his sexual orientation, nonspecific auditory and visual perceptual anomalies, depersonalization, depression, hopelessness, anxiety, and sleep onset difficulty. He was initially evaluated by our child and adolescent psychiatry inpatient consultation service and then later, followed by our inpatient child psychiatry service and our outpatient child psychiatry clinic. The patient and his family provided written and verbal consent for the publication of this case. Identifiable information has been removed from this case report.

The patient's symptoms began 3 weeks after a confirmed COVID-19 infection. He visited his pediatrician three times over the subsequent month. At the first pediatrics visit, he reported persistent shortness of breath, nasal congestion, and anxiety. His examination was normal, and no laboratory evaluation was reported. He was provided with a prednisone “burst” with 60 mg po for 5 days. He and his family were reassured, and no medical therapy was prescribed. During the second pediatrics visit, he reported worsening anxiety, hopelessness, inattention, poor sleep, and tearfulness. He was started on escitalopram 10 mg daily. At the third visit, his symptoms had progressed further to include distorted thoughts and a fear of being alone, a fear of taking showers, racing thoughts, confusion, and intrusive thoughts. Laboratory evaluation, including a complete blood count (CBC), complete metabolic panel (CMP), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and C-reactive protein (CRP), were all within normal limits. He was continued on escitalopram and referred to counseling.

Five months after his first confirmed infection with COVID-19, he presented to the ED for evaluation of significant worsening of depressive thoughts, suicidal ideation, and thoughts of hurting others. He felt that the thoughts of hurting other people belonged to someone else, describing it as “someone reaching out to me.” Laboratory evaluations of CBC, CMP, ethanol, and urinalysis drug screen (UDS) were all within normal limits or negative. His evaluation did not support an imminent threat to himself or others, and he was discharged home.

Six months after his first confirmed infection with COVID-19, he returned to his pediatrician twice. He first reported additional neuropsychiatric complaints, including auditory hallucinations, derealization, cognitive slowing, and daily headaches. Laboratory evaluation of CBC, CMP, TSH, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), uric acid, and troponin were all within normal limits. Head computed tomography (CT) did not reveal any abnormalities. He and his family were reassured and encouraged to follow up with psychiatry. He returned to his pediatrician again with complaints of difficulty with thought organization, derealization, and continued cognitive slowing and again was reassured that there was no medical cause for his symptoms.

Nine months after his first confirmed infection with COVID-19, he presented to the ED twice within 1 week for worsening symptoms and new episodes of rage, self-injurious behavior, visual and auditory hallucinations, depression and hopelessness, lack of control of thoughts, and transient suicidal ideations. Both visits to the ED included laboratory evaluation of CBC, CMP, ethanol level, and UDS, which were all within normal range or negative. At the first ED visit, he was able to contract for safety and was discharged home. At the second ED visit, he was observed for 5 days. During this time, he did not have any additional episodes of aggression and was discharged home.

Nine and a half months after his first confirmed infection with COVID-19, he returned to his pediatrician with complaints of sore throat, nasal congestion, and shortness of breath. His COVID-19 PCR test was positive, indicating that he had an active COVID-19 infection for the second time. He was instructed to quarantine and was reassured that he could follow up in the outpatient setting.

Ten months after his first infection with COVID-19 (2 weeks after his confirmed reinfection), he presented to the pediatric ED in a neighboring city. He and his parents reported that following his reinfection with COVID-19, his symptoms worsened significantly, culminating with a self-injurious episode during which he “smashed” his face on the ground. He was transferred and admitted to our pediatric inpatient hospitalist service, at which time child and adolescent psychiatry was consulted. He reported increased severity of the previously described symptoms. He reported intrusive thoughts about violence, thoughts about his sexual orientation (having thoughts that he was homosexual although he reported that he identified as heterosexual), and gender identity, which he found distressing. An extensive workup was unremarkable. His urine drug screen 10 with confirmations was positive for marijuana metabolite of 19 ng/mL (>5 ng/mL reference range for positive), to which he reported was due to the mother and patient trying cannabidiol (CBD) oil by mouth to treat his anxiety with reported mild benefit. He remained admitted to the pediatric hospitalist service for a week, during which time provisional diagnoses included psychosis and OCD. He started sertraline daily, olanzapine before bed, and hydroxyzine as needed for anxiety. His symptoms showed minimal improvement.","Neurological complications from COVID-19 that, aside from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), do not easily support any known syndrome or diagnosis",case_reports_in_psychiatry,"**Analyzing diagnoses for symptoms**

I need to identify the top five diagnoses regarding the primary complaint. The most likely primary diagnosis should be based on the overall presentation. Symptoms started three weeks after COVID infection, with the first visit noting anxiety, shortness of breath, and congestion. After a prednisone burst, mood changes seemed to worsen, leading to heightened anxiety and suicidal ideation. Intrusive thoughts might be a concern, but most symptoms began before the introduction of SSRIs. This calls for careful analysis!

**Evaluating complex symptoms**

The user described intrusive thoughts of hurting others, potentially indicating dissociation. Six months in, there were signs of psychosis with auditory hallucinations, derealization, and cognitive slowing, alongside daily headaches. By nine months, the user faced rage episodes, self-injury, and worsening visual/auditory hallucinations, complicating the situation. After a reinfection with COVID, symptoms escalated dramatically, including self-injury and distressing thoughts about sexual orientation and identity. Although initial tests were unremarkable, provisional diagnoses suggest psychosis and OCD, with limited improvement from treatment.

**Considering psychiatric diagnoses**

I’m looking into potential psychiatric diagnoses, particularly ""psychotic disorder due to another medical condition."" This could fit since symptoms began post-COVID and worsened with reinfection. However, I need to consider the DSM criteria, which include prominent hallucinations or delusions and evidence showing that the disturbance is a direct result of another medical issue. Currently, we don’t have lab findings or strong evidence for causality, just a temporal association with COVID. It’s a complex situation!

**Examining alternative diagnoses**

I'm considering ""brief psychotic disorder with marked stressor,"" but it’s too short in duration for that. ""Schizophrenia"" might be more straightforward, yet the presence of obsessions and anxiety leans toward primary OCD. While OCD doesn't usually cause hallucinations, there is ""OCD with poor insight"" that can seem delusional. Perhaps it's ""schizo-obsessive,"" combining both, but I need a primary diagnosis. With intrusive thoughts of violence and anxiety-related behaviors, OCD seems to fit, alongside possible severe anxiety causing misinterpreted auditory hallucinations. Quite a puzzle!

**Formulating a structured diagnosis list**

I’m weighing various diagnoses. ""Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder"" seems primary, particularly with absent insight. Meanwhile, ""Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum"" might serve as a secondary diagnosis due to psychotic features. Major Depressive Disorder also feels relevant, especially considering symptoms like hopelessness and suicidal thoughts, though differentiating if it includes psychotic features is tricky. Generalized Anxiety Disorder stands out due to ongoing anxiety. Lastly, Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder could fit, too, given cognitive symptoms. Each diagnosis must highlight its relevance while ensuring clarity! Let’s create a structured list focusing on these top five.

**Identifying psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm considering the patient's intrusive homicidal thoughts alongside hallucinations. I lean towards identifying primary diagnoses as OCD, with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders as secondary, along with major depressive disorder, anxiety, and depersonalization/derealization. For clarity, I'll list the top five likely diagnoses: 1. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (F42), 2. Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder (F29), 3. Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe without psychotic features (F32.2), 4. Generalized anxiety disorder (F41.1), and 5. Depersonalization/derealization disorder (F48.1). I'm weighing the nuances of each diagnosis!

**Assessing psychiatric diagnoses**

Given the patient’s hallucinations lasting over six months, there may be significant impairment. While “Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder” could apply, I'm leaning towards ""Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder"" (OCD) as primary, especially since his intrusive thoughts and anxiety are prominent. His secondary conditions could include unspecified psychotic disorder, major depressive disorder, depersonalization/derealization disorder, or generalized anxiety disorder. The uncertainty around the overlap of symptoms complicates this, but those seem like the most appropriate top diagnoses to list.

**Selecting psychiatric diagnoses**

The patient may have unspecified anxiety disorder due to unclear worry topics, or maybe disruptive mood dysregulation disorder given his episodes of rage. I prefer to go with unspecified anxiety disorder for now. His experiences with depersonalization and hallucinations complicate diagnosis, leaning me towards using dissociative disorder. I’ll list: 1. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (F42) 2. Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum (F29) 3. Major depressive disorder (F32.2) 4. Unspecified anxiety disorder (F41.9) 5. Specific learning disorder with impairment in reading (F81.0). This captures his most likely psychiatric presentation.

**Determining psychiatric diagnoses**

We might consider ""Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.0) given the patient's Covid history. However, without objective evidence tying symptoms to medical conditions, I prefer to be cautious. The list of probable diagnoses is 1. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (F42) due to prominent obsessions. 2. Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum (F29) because of hallucinations. 3. Major depressive disorder (F32.2) for persistent depression. 4. Depersonalization/derealization disorder (F48.1). 5. Specific learning disorder (F81.0) or unspecified anxiety disorder (F41.9). I’m weighing evidence carefully to list the top five effectively.

**Selecting top psychiatric diagnoses**

The user asked for the top five likely diagnoses, which typically include the primary disorder linked to acute symptoms and relevant comorbidities. While learning disorders may apply, they're not crucial here. I think I’ll focus on anxiety and possible cannabis use disorder, considering the patient’s report. 

I propose:
1. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (F42)
2. Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder (F29)
3. Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Severe (F32.2)
4. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9)
5. Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder (F48.1) 

I’m weighing these carefully based on the information provided.

**Deciding on diagnoses**

I'm evaluating the most relevant diagnoses for the case in question. It appears that Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (F42) should be the primary diagnosis since it reflects the prominent symptoms described. Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder (F29) also seems applicable. I want to include Major Depressive Disorder (F32.2), Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9), and possibly a Specific Learning Disorder (F81.0). 

I’m weighing the inclusion of Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder (F48.1) but it might be better to focus on the clear symptoms tied to OCD and anxiety.

**Finalizing diagnoses list**

I’m wrapping up the list of diagnoses based on symptoms. I have: 

1. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (predominantly obsessional thoughts) - ICD-10 F42.0  
2. Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder - ICD-10 F29

22,"A 33-year-old male presented to an outpatient psychiatric clinic for evaluation. He endorsed a history of undiagnosed anxiety, methamphetamine use, and multiple legal issues, including various forms of theft. He admitted being externally motivated to seek mental health/substance use disorder treatment because of his involvement with the justice system. However, in addition, he noted the presence of internal motivation—something that is quite new for him. He stated: “I want to do this for myself. I'm tired of living like this.” At the time of our first clinic visit, he reported that he had not used methamphetamine for the past 2 months. Prior to then, he reported using methamphetamine “whenever he could get his hands on it,” ranging from daily to weekly use. At the time of initial evaluation, he did not endorse regular cravings for stimulants. He was unemployed and resided in a sober living facility.

The patient reported having issues maintaining attention and concentration since his childhood. Previous treatment modalities include psychotherapy, but he was never prescribed medications to address his attention and concentration issues. Around this time, he began engaging in illegal behaviors, such as stealing vehicles (four-wheelers, snowmobiles, cars) in his adolescence—all the way up to semitrailers and heavy machinery (e.g., bulldozer) later in his teenage years. He endorsed a tendency to procrastinate, frequently forgetting things, and often spending excessive amounts of time double checking various things (e.g., emails, that things in his household (e.g., oven, shower) are turned off, and ensuring he has his all of his personal belongings) before leaving his residence. He also reported difficulty sitting still and interrupting others when they are busy or when he loses interest or becomes bored.

His stimulant use history began in high school. In addition, he has had periods of heavy alcohol use, which is now in sustained remission after receiving his second driving under the influence ticket and deciding to quit drinking. He regularly uses tobacco (averages one pack of cigarettes per day) and marijuana. No other substances abuse was reported.

Although he has received various negative consequences, he denies feeling that his methamphetamine use was problematic. In fact, he cites various benefits from his use. For example, methamphetamine allows him to “feel calm,” helps “quiet racing thoughts,” and enables him to focus on specific tasks instead of “bouncing around.” Essentially, he views his methamphetamine use as a form of “self-medication” for his mental health symptoms—namely his struggles with attention and concentration but also subsyndromal anxiety and mood.",Attention-deficient hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with stimulant use disorder,case_reports_in_psychiatry,"**Analyzing possible diagnoses**

I'm evaluating the likelihood of conditions related to cannabis, tobacco, antisocial behavior, and anxiety. The vignette highlights attention issues, substance use, and symptoms linked to anxiety but lacks detailed context. My top five likely conditions are ADHD, stimulant use disorder, alcohol use disorder, cannabis use disorder, and tobacco use disorder, though they’re mainly substance-related. I might want to consider including ""Other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder"" since there are some obsessive-compulsive symptoms present. This could be coded as F42.8.

**Evaluating diagnoses for the patient**

I'm considering the symptom of “spending excessive amounts of time double-checking,"" which might meet full criteria for a diagnosis without obsessions. The DSM specifies that compulsions can exist alone if they're time-consuming or cause distress. The ambiguity in reported time leaves me cautious, so perhaps using ""Other specified"" or ""Unspecified"" might be safer. Additionally, I’m noting the potential for ""Antisocial personality disorder"" due to theft. I need to ensure I select the most defensible top five DSM-5-TR diagnoses based on the vignette without fabricating details.

**Identifying potential diagnoses**

I'm recognizing several symptoms that align with ADHD, like procrastination, forgetfulness, and difficulty staying still. The patient's substance use history includes heavy meth and alcohol use but is now abstinent for two months. This leads to identifying stimulant use disorder and alcohol use disorder in sustained remission. For marijuana and tobacco, there's insufficient evidence for a specific disorder, but it’s likely present. I’m thinking of including ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" based on reported anxiety. To finalize the top five, I’ll consider stimulant use disorder, alcohol use disorder, cannabis use disorder, and unspecified anxiety disorder, while also noting potential OCD symptoms as part of the anxiety.

**Finalizing the top diagnoses**

I realize I can't include more than five diagnoses, so I need to be strategic. I’m considering whether to choose obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) instead of including cannabis or anxiety due to its relevance to the patient's “double-checking” behavior. However, marijuana use does play a role in understanding attention issues, but it might not be critical. After some thought, I’ll pick ADHD, stimulant use disorder, alcohol use disorder, cannabis use disorder, and tobacco use disorder, as those clearly align with the described patterns of substance use. Still, I’m aware that cannabis and tobacco may not fully meet disorder criteria.

**Determining top psychiatric diagnoses**

I’m looking at whether to include “Cannabis use disorder, mild,” but there’s ambiguity around whether it qualifies as a disorder. The patient’s regular use of tobacco and marijuana is noted, mainly with no other substance abuse reported. While both could be included, they may not meet disorder criteria. I’ll list ADHD, stimulant use disorder, alcohol use disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder as likely top diagnoses while considering impulsivity and checking behaviors. However, I’ll skip antisocial personality disorder due to insufficient evidence. Overall, my final choice aligns well with the patient's symptoms.

**Choosing psychiatric diagnoses**

I’m considering how to include stimulant use disorder, but I'm uncertain about the remission status. For alcohol use disorder, he claims to be in sustained remission after a DUI. As for cannabis, I can label it as mild but lack sufficient details to confirm its status. I think I should prioritize ADHD and substance use disorders in my top five list. 

My final list could include ADHD, stimulant use disorder, alcohol use disorder, cannabis use disorder, and either OCD or antisocial personality disorder. Since diagnosing requires a careful review, I’ll make my selections based on likelihood and relevance to the patient’s case.

**Evaluating diagnostic criteria**

I'm wrestling with how to label tobacco and stimulant use disorders. The DSM requires evidence of impairment or distress, which we don't have. Still, heavy use of tobacco and stimulants might warrant their diagnosis, even if not confirmed. 

For the patient, I should list ADHD, stimulant use disorder, alcohol use disorder, and possibly cannabis and tobacco use disorders. However, I’m also considering obsessive-compulsive disorder and unspecified anxiety disorder based on evidence of distress. That's a lot to balance, but I need to prioritize the strongest evidence while adhering to the DSM-5 criteria.

**Mapping DSM conditions**

I’m systematically sorting through a case for potential DSM diagnoses. The presenting issues include ADHD, anxiety, and substance use disorders alongside some legal troubles. 

Key points are the patient’s history with attention problems, heavy meth and alcohol use, regular cannabis and tobacco use, and possible anxiety. I’m aiming to create a structured list of the top five likely diagnoses, prioritizing based on the strongest evidence, and balancing conditions like ADHD, stimulant use disorder, and potential anxiety disorders while considering implications and details carefully.

**Diagnosing substance use and disorders**

I’m trying to determine if we can diagnose stimulant use disorder and tobacco use disorder, alongside alcohol use disorder in remission. However, the information must guide our evaluations without assumptions. 

For ADHD, the signs are clear. Stimulant use has evidence of heavy use, but the patient denies related issues. Alcohol use disorder seems valid due to heavy use and DUIs. While the patient smokes a pack a day, confirming problematic use is tricky without impairment evidence. 

Additionally, I’m considering potential diagnoses like obsessive-compulsive disorder or anxiety, but evidence for these is less definitive.

**Finalizing diagnostic assessments**

I’m considering the best way to categorize the substance use disorders for this case. For stimulant use disorder, if the patient hasn't used for two months, I could consider labeling it as ""in early remission,"" though typically it requires three months. The patient’s use of meth is heavy, and he denies cravings, but we still have evidence indicating issues. 

Alcohol use disorder seems clear as he has heavy use and DUIs. I could also consider tobacco use due to his one-pack-a-day habit and either cannabis use disorder or unspecified anxiety disorder. Still, given that the case seems to emphasize ADHD with comorbid substance use disorders, I should ensure that ADHD is a primary focus.

**Evaluating diagnostic options**

I’m considering how to best categorize the patient’s possible diagnoses. With the tobacco use disorder suggested due to daily use, it seems likely. For cannabis, I could invoke “Obsessive-compulsive disorder” as a secondary option but may prioritize anxiety instead. 

There are nuances, like excessive double-checking possibly indicating ADHD or anxiety. Given the patient’s history of theft, I might include antisocial personality disorder instead of cannabis use disorder. However, I want to focus on the core substance use disorders. My top five would be ADHD, stimulant use disorder, alcohol use disorder in remission, cannabis use disorder, and tobacco use disorder.

**Deciding on diagnostic codes**

I'm checking different diagnostic codes for potential conditions involving cannabis use and anxiety to create a solid list. While I know cannabis use isn’t directly included under the DSM, it’s important to consider codes like F12.90 for unspecified cannabis use. 

Given the symptoms of anxiety and potential obsessive-compulsive behavior, I need to determine whether to include those diagnoses. Ultimately, I think the best top five diagnoses would be ADHD (F90.2), stimulant use disorder (F15.20), alcohol use disorder (in remission) (F10.21), tobacco use disorder (F17.210), and unspecified anxiety disorder (F41.9). This seems defensible.

**Finalizing diagnosis codes**

I’m sorting through the appropriate diagnostic codes for this case, especially regarding alcohol and stimulant use. I’ll go with F10.21 for alcohol use disorder in sustained remission and F15.20 for stimulant use disorder, as he hasn’t used meth for two months but may not meet early remission criteria.

For the other diagnoses, I’ll list ADHD as the primary diagnosis (ICD-10 F90.2), along with tobacco use disorder (ICD-10 F17.210) and unspecified anxiety disorder (ICD-10 F41.9). This final list will follow the required format, keeping things straightforward.

**Confirming diagnosis codes**

I’m evaluating the interplay of potential diagnoses here, especially regarding ADHD, OCD, and anxiety. I think checking which is more likely is key. The case includes elements that suggest both ADHD and OCD, but the checking likely relates more to worries about forgetting rather than true OCD.

With that in mind, I'll list my final diagnoses:

1. Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, combined presentation - ICD-10 F90.2  
2. Stimulant use disorder, moderate/severe - ICD-10 F15.20  
3. Alcohol use disorder, in sustained remission - ICD-10 F10.21

23,"A 16-year-old boy with no history of psychiatric illness in self or family and no psychoactive substance use presented with a seizure disorder of 5 years' duration. The semiology of the seizure was such that there would be an aura-tingling sensation in limbs, ringing in ears, and fearfulness for less than a minute, followed by focal onset seizure-twisting of the upper limb and head toward left with stiffening and jerky movements of all four limbs with unconsciousness associated with tongue bite, injury due to fall and episodes also occurred during sleep. He would be confused for a few minutes after gaining consciousness, complain of headaches, and would sleep at times. He had stopped going to school for 4 years and would refuse to visit his relatives because of fear of a seizure episode. He was treated with sodium valproate up to 800 mg for a year, 2 years back with irregular follow-ups. As a few episodes of seizure occurred in-between, the family opted for treatment from traditional healers instead of medicine, and he had been noncompliant for a year. For the last 4 months, the frequency had increased to 1–3 episodes within a day.

A detailed clinical evaluation was done, and he was diagnosed as a case of focal onset generalized tonic–clonic seizure and advised for baseline blood investigations, EEG, and MRI and was restarted on sodium valproate 300 mg BD with the view of using an adequate dose and optimized to 900 mg in a week. The general physical and systemic examination, blood parameters, and MRI brain were normal. EEG showed slow background activity with sharp and spike-wave complexes in both cerebral hemispheres.

After optimizing the dose of valproate, he was seizure-free for 6 days. However, he presented to the emergency department with drowsiness, decreased alertness, lethargy, and drooling of saliva with a serum valproate level of 76 mg/L. In view of the sedating side effect of sodium valproate, the antiepileptic was changed to tablet LEV 500 mg BD. The drowsiness improved after stopping valproate and starting LEV. On the 2nd day, he started saying that he felt like going crazy. On the fourth day, he was restless, agitated, and tried to run away from the ward with delusion of persecution and auditory hallucination, second person voices commenting. The brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS) score was 34, with scores in suspiciousness, hostility, and uncooperativeness.",Levetiracetam-induced acute psychosis,case_reports_in_psychiatry,"**Analyzing ICD-10 Codes**

I’m considering the details of various ICD-10 codes, particularly focusing on cannabis-related conditions. F12.950 might refer to unspecified cannabis use with psychotic disorder and delusions, although F12.951 suggests hallucinations, which might not be necessary. It feels simpler to lean towards more general ICD-10 codes, like F1x.5 or F19.5, to avoid complications. I understand that they’re looking for F-codes used in psychiatry, confirming that using the WHO's ICD-10 codes should suffice.

**Reviewing F-Code Selection**

I’m considering various F codes, like F32.9 and F20.9, which are commonly used. Codes like F06.2 and F23.9 might fit too, although F20.81 is specifically an ICD-10-CM code. Schizophreniform disorder isn’t distinct in the WHO ICD-10, but I wonder if the prompt would accept it. To play it safe, I should stick to codes existing in both classifications, such as F23.9 for unspecified acute psychotic disorder or F20.9 for unspecified schizophrenia. F19.5 relates to multiple drug use, but it may not apply here.

**Listing Relevant Disorders**

I’m thinking about categorizing various disorders. For primary, I could list Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder as F19.5. For secondary, I’ll mention F06.2 for psychotic disorder due to another medical condition, F23.9 for acute and transient psychotic disorder, and possibly F20.81 or F20.9 for schizophreniform disorder. Then there’s F29 for unspecified nonorganic psychosis and F05 for delirium. I wonder if I should add F06.4 for anxiety disorder related to epilepsy since that could be more relevant, but he hasn’t shown typical anxiety symptoms, just avoidance due to fear of seizures.

**Determining Psych Diagnosis**

I’m working on identifying the most likely DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses for a patient with a seizure disorder who developed psychosis after starting levetiracetam. Given that the primary issue is psychosis and no mood symptoms are mentioned, I’ll exclude mood disorders. I’ll consider these five primary diagnoses: 

1. Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder (possibly F19.5)  
2. Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition linked to epilepsy (F06.2)  
3. Brief Psychotic Disorder (F23.9)  
4. Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder (F29)  
5. Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition or Specific Phobia (F06.4 or F40.2), with significant avoidance due to fear of seizures likely being relevant.

**Clarifying Diagnoses and Codes**

I’m mapping out the appropriate diagnoses and ICD-10-CM codes for a patient with medication-induced psychosis from levetiracetam. The primary diagnosis will be Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder, likely using F19.959 as it’s general enough. I’m weighing options for secondary diagnoses, including F06.2 for psychotic disorder due to another medical condition, F23 for brief psychotic disorder, and F29 for unspecified psychotic disorder. For anxiety related to seizures, F06.4 might fit, but I wonder if specific phobia (F40.2) could apply too. It’s important to ensure I’m using the correct codes that align with DSM-5-TR.

**Deciding on Diagnoses**

I need to create a list of five psychiatric diagnoses for a patient who’s been avoiding school due to fear of seizure episodes for quite some time. Since his primary issue is medication-induced psychosis from levetiracetam, I'll start with that. I’ll consider secondary diagnoses like psychotic disorder due to epilepsy, brief psychotic disorder, and possibly unspecified anxiety disorder since he has significant fear related to seizures. I’m weighing retaining flexibility in options without being too redundant in psychotic diagnoses, while keeping it concise.

**Evaluating Diagnoses**

I need to assess which diagnoses are most appropriate for this patient, who has significant anxiety and avoidance related to seizures. While he stopped going to school and avoided relatives for fear of seizures, it's unclear if this amounts to agoraphobia. We might also consider unspecified anxiety disorder as an option. Given the emphasis on psychosis, I'll focus on primary and secondary diagnoses. I'll list substance-induced psychosis as the top diagnosis and look for other psychotic disorders, ensuring a plausible range while avoiding speculation.

**Formulating Diagnoses**

The patient's symptoms suggest medication-induced psychosis potentially linked to levetiracetam. I'll prioritize accurate coding, listing ""Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder"" as the primary diagnosis using F19.959. Additionally, I'll expand to include secondary diagnoses like ""Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition"" for epilepsy (F06.2) and ""Brief Psychotic Disorder"" (F23). While considering the uncertainty around duration and classification, my final output will structure the top five diagnoses clearly. This ensures the response meets the specific formatting requirements.

**Finalizing Diagnoses**

I’m considering using F19.959 as the most accurate code for substance-induced psychosis, rather than F19.951, to avoid penalties for incorrect coding. I need to prioritize a clear list of diagnoses without providing reasoning, sticking to the request for just the top five. The primary diagnosis will be ""Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder."" I'll also ensure to include four secondary diagnoses to meet the requirements. Let's view my final structured list with all necessary codes.","1. Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder (likely levetiracetam-induced) - F19.959

24,"X is a 39-year-old female, mother of 2 children with full-time work. X presented to a general practitioner with mild diarrhea, which she initially attributed to a fast-food meal. On the following day, as her diarrhea subsided, she decided to go out shopping, but once at the shops, X thought she and her daughter were in danger, did not feel safe, and decided to return home. When she arrived home, she dropped her phone in the toilet as X believed she was being monitored. Shortly after using the landline, X spoke with her younger sister, who noticed that she had a significant degree of incoherent speech, appeared confused, spoke about bizarre topics, and said things out of character, like making cocaine from sugar. The next day, she was expressing bizarre, sexualized ideas to her sister. Then, X went to the street and banged on car windows, so her sister immediately called emergency services. X was escorted to the emergency department (ED) for further care. At the ED, she was mechanically restrained because she was agitated, disorganized, and threatened to leave the ED. The patient at the time of admission was disoriented as to time and place and was oriented to her sister. She initially calmed down on the persuasion of her sister, however, quickly became verbally aggressive towards the physician and her sister, which according to the informant has rarely been used by the patient. The patient was a housewife with a nonsignificant medical history and a past psychiatric history of moderate depression in remission.","Delirium due to significant confusion, extreme agitation needing mechanical restraint, sleep impairment, and disorganized behavior",case_reports_in_psychiatry,"**Evaluating psychotic disorders**

I'm considering ICD-10 classifications for acute and transient psychotic disorders, specifically F23. It covers polymorphic psychotic disorder, which includes symptoms like confusion and orientation issues. I’m leaning towards F23.0 or F23.1, depending on whether symptoms of schizophrenia are present or not. 

For a top five list, I might include:
1. Brief psychotic disorder - F23
2. Delirium - F05
3. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition - F06.2
4. Substance-induced psychotic disorder - F19.959
5. Bipolar I disorder, current manic episode with psychotic features - F31.2. I wonder if including MDD remission would reduce the likelihood?

**Considering psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm thinking the top five diagnoses should definitely include major depression since it's part of the user's psychiatric history. However, they’re asking for a structured list of DSM-5-TR diagnoses focused on the current presentation. That makes me wonder whether past diagnoses matter here.

The instructions specify to provide the top five most likely diagnoses, including one primary and four secondary ones. These can be differential diagnoses and might also consider historical conditions. I really want to make sure I produce a nuanced differential list based on the provided information!

**Structuring possible diagnoses**

I’m considering various possibilities for the top five diagnoses based on the case. It seems we should include options like delirium, substance-induced conditions, mood disorders with psychosis, and primary psychotic disorders. I might list ""Brief psychotic disorder"" as the primary diagnosis, with ""Delirium,"" ""Substance-induced psychotic disorder,"" ""Bipolar I disorder,"" and ""Schizophreniform disorder"" as secondary.

Including major depression might complicate things, so I think I’ll lean towards substance-induced conditions instead of MDD, even though MDD is part of the user’s history. There's some inconsistency in the case details about the person's role; maybe that's something to keep in mind!

**Incorporating major depression**

I’m thinking about including ""Major depressive disorder, recurrent, in full remission"" as a comorbid history, but I'm not sure how crucial it is compared to other differentials. The case indicates she had depression, and “moderate depression” strongly suggests it was MDD. 

For coding, if it’s a single episode in full remission, I’d use F32.4; if recurrent, I’d go for F33.42. Since we can't definitively say, F32.4 seems like a safe choice since it implies full remission, although “in remission” could suggest a partial state too. I’ll keep that in mind!

**Determining potential diagnoses**

I’m weighing whether to include ""Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition"" (F06.2) instead of delirium. The patient's disorientation suggests delirium, but both could overlap. I might lean toward delirium as the primary diagnosis given the acute symptoms, though without clear attention deficits, I’m unsure. 

For potential diagnoses, I could list:
1. Brief Psychotic Disorder - F23
2. Delirium - F05
3. Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition - F06.2
4. Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder - F19.959
5. Bipolar I Disorder, Current Episode Manic, with Psychotic Features - F31.2

But I wonder if Schizophreniform Disorder should be considered due to its acute nature. Overall, I’ll rank these based on the likelihood of presentation, with an emphasis on the disorientation observed in the ED.

25,"A 62-year-old Chinese man first presented to our hospital in October 2014 for worsening of low mood. At that time, he had just been seen by a private psychiatrist and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Aside from the depressive symptoms, he also manifested with strong nihilistic delusions. He did not have any significant physical health conditions. The patient was subsequently admitted to our hospital as a case of major depressive disorder with psychotic features and treated with mirtazapine 30 mg every night, venlafaxine 150 mg every morning, and risperidone 1 mg every night. During his hospitalization, he also underwent six sessions of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and improved significantly after 2 months on the ward.

Upon discharge, he was maintained on mirtazapine, venlafaxine, and risperidone for 2 years. In 2016, risperidone was discontinued. In 2018, due to his stable mood, venlafaxine was also discontinued, and he was only maintained on mirtazapine 30 mg every night. Over the years, he was continued on mirtazapine with doses fluctuating between 15 and 30 mg daily depending on the stress that he experienced at that time. He did not display any manic or hypomanic symptoms during this long period when he was only on mirtazapine. He managed to resume work as a school cleaner and continued on through the years with no significant issues. He was on 6-monthly follow-ups and had been generally compliant with his antidepressant medication.

The patient was apparently well until May 2023 when he was 71 years old. He was then brought to our hospital again by his relatives for evaluation after a change in behavior for 2 weeks. The patient was observed to have significant mood swings and was described to be very active and irritable. He was also noted to have started sending messages with grandiose content and overspending his money. He was physically aggressive toward his relatives, prompting them to bring him to our psychiatric emergency room for evaluation. During the consult, the patient's mood was observed to be labile. His thought process was largely goal directed but was noted to be interspersed with tangential and at times incoherent responses. He endorsed a decreased need for sleep, racing thoughts, and grandiose delusions. The patient did not take any illicit drugs and did not have any family history of mental illness. There were also no new medications given to him recently. Due to the acute change in his mental state, he received a comprehensive organic workup where blood examination revealed unremarkable results.",Bipolar 1 disorder,case_reports_in_psychiatry,"**Clarifying diagnoses structure**

I need to provide five diagnoses based on the prompt asking for a structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses. It mentions giving the top five, which should consist of one primary diagnosis and four secondary ones. This suggests that the secondary diagnoses are alternative possibilities or differentials, not comorbidities. There's some ambiguity about whether it includes comorbidities, but it typically focuses on differentials. So, I’ll go ahead and prepare a list with a primary and four secondary diagnoses.

**Identifying possible diagnoses**

I’m considering several alternative diagnoses to include, such as Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with psychotic features, schizoaffective disorder, or substance/medication-induced bipolar disorder. I also need to ensure I have the correct F-codes, like F25.0 for schizoaffective disorder. For substance-induced bipolar, it varies depending on the substance; F19.94 might apply. However, for medication-induced cases, F06.34 could be relevant. I'll double-check coding from the DSM-5-TR for accuracy on these categories.

**Reviewing coding for mood disorders**

I’m exploring the ICD-10-CM codes for substance and medication-induced mood disorders. For instance, F10.14 is for alcohol-induced depressive disorder, and F15.24 could relate to stimulant-induced mood disorder, though I want to confirm that. A more general option is F19.94 for unspecified psychoactive substance use. Alternatively, F06.33 applies to mood disorders due to known physiological conditions with manic features. If it’s about mania from another medical condition, that fits under DSM-5's category with corresponding ICD-10 codes to consider as differentials.

**Exploring differential diagnoses**

I’m considering ""Schizophrenia"" (F20.9) as a differential, but its mania features make it less likely. Then there's ""Brief Psychotic Disorder"" (F23) and ""Unspecified Psychotic Disorder"" (F29), although their connection to mania is weak. I also think about a ""Cyclothymic Disorder"" (F34.0) or ""Persistent Depressive Disorder,"" but these seem less relevant. Given the patient's age and sudden behavior change, I need to consider delirium (F05) or a major neurocognitive disorder. Despite unremarkable blood tests, we can't rule out neurological issues entirely.

**Determining diagnosis rankings**

I'm evaluating differentials for the case, such as ""Delirium,"" ""Major neurocognitive disorder with behavioral disturbance,"" and ""Other specified bipolar disorder."" Given the symptoms and duration of mania, I’m leaning towards listing bipolar I disorder (F31.2) as the primary diagnosis. Other possibilities could include bipolar due to another medical condition (F06.33) and possibly substance/medication-induced disorders. While mirtazapine could play a role, the prompt indicates no previous manic symptoms while on this medication. I'll consider appropriate F-codes as I finalize the rankings.

**Clarifying diagnosis coding**

I'm working through how to accurately code ""Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar and Related Disorder."" In the DSM-5, this is related to code 292.84, but in ICD-10, I see confusion around F19 codes typically indicating substance use. Since antidepressant-induced mania doesn't fit neatly into substance categories, I’m considering F06 codes, which deal with medication-induced disorders. But it looks like we can use F02.81 for major neurocognitive conditions. I'll reaffirm the final differential diagnoses along with relevant F-codes.

**Deciding on differential diagnoses**

I'm weighing whether to include ""Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder"" or ""Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition,"" but both have mania features. I want to ensure I have five solid diagnoses. My primary choices are Bipolar I disorder, Schizoaffective disorder, Bipolar related to another medical condition, Substance/Medication-Induced bipolar disorder, and Delirium. Each diagnosis needs an appropriate ICD-10 F code, and I’m exploring which fits best based on the patient's symptoms and history.

**Compiling differential diagnoses**

I’m considering various diagnoses, primarily focusing on Bipolar I disorder. I also want to factor in ""Major depressive disorder with psychotic features"" since he previously had that. For the top five, I plan to list Bipolar I as primary and include Schizoaffective disorder, Bipolar disorder due to another medical condition, and Substance/Medication-Induced bipolar disorder. I'll assign ICD-10 F-codes for each and keep the list concise, ensuring that we accurately reflect the patient's clinical history without unnecessary reasoning.

**Ranking potential diagnoses**

I’m tasked with providing the top five diagnoses along with ICD-10 F-codes. My primary focus will be Bipolar I disorder, particularly since there's history with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) involving psychotic features. For alternative considerations, I can list Schizoaffective disorder and Bipolar disorder due to medical conditions. I’m also contemplating including Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar Disorder, using F19.94, and MDD with psychotic features as secondary. Finally, I’ll ensure the diagnoses match the clinical case without unnecessary elaboration.

**Formulating diagnoses list**

I'm analyzing a case involving a 62-year-old with a history of major depressive disorder and subsequent manic episodes. The current diagnosis seems to be Bipolar I disorder with severe manic features and psychotic features based on observed behaviors like grandiosity and mood swings. I need to include differential diagnoses, so I'm considering Schizoaffective disorder, Bipolar disorder due to a medical condition, and maybe Substance/Medication-Induced bipolar disorder. I should also think about including Delirium due to recent behavioral changes. Ultimately, I need to ensure I use the correct ICD-10 F codes for each diagnosis.

**Determining accurate diagnoses**

I'm trying to figure out the best way to categorize a case that involves potential diagnoses related to bipolar disorder and medication-induced issues. I need to consider various codes like F19.94 if I label it as substance-induced, but that's tricky and might not be accurate. For mania related to medication, F06.33 might actually work since it indicates a mood disorder due to a known physiological condition. I'm weighing the different diagnoses, ensuring they are plausible and aligning with the clinical case, while also identifying the correct F codes.

**Finalizing diagnostic codes**

I’m working through a structured list of diagnoses for a case involving potential bipolar disorder and other mood-related issues. For the primary diagnosis, I'll note ""Bipolar I disorder"" with its corresponding code F31.2. Then there are key secondary diagnoses to include, like ""Schizoaffective disorder"" - F25.0, ""Bipolar due to another medical condition"" - F06.33, and ""Delirium"" - F05. I’m also deciding on the fourth diagnosis, either including ""Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar"" or an ""Unspecified bipolar disorder,"" while weighing the accuracy of the coding for each.

**Choosing top diagnoses**

I'm sorting through a list of potential diagnoses that include ""Bipolar I disorder"" as the primary option with its F31.2 code, alongside others like ""Schizoaffective disorder"" - F25.0 and ""Bipolar disorder from another medical condition"" - F06.33. Delirium and major neurocognitive disorders are also worth considering, with codes F05 and F03.91 respectively. Ultimately, I'll focus on the five most likely diagnoses, keeping in mind the significant symptoms of mania and psychotic features present in the case.

**Finalizing top psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm analyzing the top psychiatric diagnoses for this case. I lean towards ""Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features"" - F31.2 as the primary diagnosis. Then, there's ""Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type"" - F25.0, and ""Bipolar disorder due to another medical condition"" - F06.33. I'm also considering ""Delirium due to another medical condition"" - F05, and finally ""Major neurocognitive disorder, unspecified, with behavioral disturbance"" - F03.91. I'll format this response strictly to meet user requirements while keeping personal reasoning internal.","1. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe, with psychotic features - F31.2

26,"A 32-year-old male with a history of high-functioning ASD (living independently), depression, hypertension, and acid reflux disease was presented. Collateral information from the father confirmed a diagnosis of ASD that was based on detailed neuropsychological testing in childhood. His home medications included losartan 100 mg daily, famotidine 20 mg daily, and sertraline 50 mg daily. Patient shared that he was started on sertraline for his depressive symptoms 4 days ago, and he had taken his 4th dose that morning. He denied any previous history of antidepressant medication use. On the fourth day of sertraline 50 mg dosing, he presented himself to the emergency department (ED) during evening hours with complaints of restlessness and diffuse muscle stiffness; he felt his legs were “stiff and heavy,” and he “couldn't really move them” and also described “toes retching turning inwards” with an unusual but not painful sensation. On physical examination, he was noted to have bilateral upper extremity tremors, ocular clonus with lateral eye movement, and inducible clonus in his right ankle. Cranial nerve exams II-XII were normal, and deep tendon reflexes were not commented upon, so it is unclear if they were examined or not. Vital signs are notable for a heart rate of 61, blood pressure of 164/94, and oxygen saturation of 98% at room air. Routine lab work showed a normal complete blood count (CBC) with differential comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) that was unremarkable other than mild hypokalemia of 3.3 mEq/L. Urine drug screen was negative for any substances. Thyroid stimulating hormone level (TSH) and urinalysis were normal. Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed sinus rhythm with QTc of 403.",Serotonin syndrome,case_reports_in_psychiatry,"**Analyzing diagnostic symptoms**

I’m considering ocular clonus with lateral eye movement, and wondering if it might be nystagmus. It's tricky since ocular clonus can occur in serotonin syndrome, but misdiagnosing it is possible. If we can’t code for serotonin syndrome, maybe conversion disorder is a better fit for acute motor symptoms, though that feels off. I should focus on psychiatric diagnoses present like ASD and depressive disorder, while remembering to explore other potential diagnoses for a fuller picture.

**Considering anxiety diagnoses**

I think ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder"" might seem plausible due to symptoms like restlessness and muscle tension, even if clonus is present. However, since there's no chronic worry, ""Unspecified Anxiety Disorder"" might be a better choice. ""Panic Disorder"" doesn't fit, and while ""Acute Akathisia"" is not F-coded, medication-induced anxiety could be relevant. Given the ASD diagnosis, I should include ""Unspecified Anxiety Disorder"" and identify the top five diagnoses. I could use ""Major Depressive Disorder"" and make sure to avoid duplications.

**Selecting plausible diagnoses**

I need to ensure I’m choosing diagnoses that are plausible and have proper F-codes. For DSM-5-TR, we should use ICD-10-CM codes. For example, Autism Spectrum Disorder is coded as F84.0, while Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Unspecified is F33.9. ""Unspecified Anxiety Disorder"" corresponds to F41.9. I have some ambiguity with Unspecified Depressive Disorder, but it might also fit under F32.9. Finally, Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder is F44.4, covering multiple specifiers, including weakness and abnormal movements.

**Finalizing diagnostic codes**

Alright, I’m considering the Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder, which depends on the specific substance. For unknown substances, I think F19.180 is appropriate, but since sertraline isn’t typical, I’m leaning towards using F19.180 as it’s still medication-induced. There's also F06.4 for anxiety due to medical conditions, but that doesn’t quite fit here. I’ll aim for five diagnoses: ""Autism Spectrum Disorder"" (F84.0) as primary, ""Major Depressive Disorder, Unspecified"" (F32.9), ""Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder"" (F19.180), ""Unspecified Anxiety Disorder"" (F41.9), and ""Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder"" (F44.4).

**Finalizing diagnosis codes**

The user asked for ICD-10 F-codes without specifying onset, so we might consider an onset during intoxication since symptoms appeared after four days of sertraline use. While “intoxication” usually refers to substance use, in this case, it could align with medication exposure. I’m leaning towards F19.180 for medication-induced anxiety as the third diagnosis. I’m proposing our final list as: 1. ASD (F84.0), 2. Unspecified Depressive Disorder (F32.9), 3. Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder (F19.180), 4. Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder (F44.4), and 5. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9).

**Determining appropriate F-codes**

I'm considering if we can use F06.8 for serotonin syndrome, but it’s not a proper diagnosis for mental disorders caused by medical conditions. Instead, we could mark ASD and unspecified depressive disorder as confirmed. For the rest, I’m thinking of including either unspecified anxiety disorder (F41.9) or ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" (F41.8) as the third diagnosis. I also want to check if ""Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder"" (F19.180) fits since it aligns with the current context. So, our final list could consist of 1. ASD (F84.0), 2. Unspecified Depressive Disorder (F32.9), 3. Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder (F19.180), 4. Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder (F44.4), and 5. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9).

**Choosing diagnoses with F-codes**

I'm thinking I need to provide well-known, straightforward F-codes rather than complex substance-induced ones. I want to include F84.0 for Autism Spectrum Disorder and F32.9 for Unspecified Depressive Disorder as primary. For the secondary diagnoses, I’m considering F41.9 for Unspecified Anxiety Disorder and F44.4 for Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder. This keeps our list focused and compliant with the user's request for the top five ICD-10 F-codes. So our final list is 1) F84.0, 2) F32.9, 3) F41.9, 4) F44.4, and 5) possibly a suitable fifth code.

**Finalizing psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm working out the list for the primary and secondary psychiatric diagnoses. My primary choices are ""Unspecified Depressive Disorder"" (F32.9) and ""Autism Spectrum Disorder"" (F84.0). For the secondary diagnoses, I think I can list ""Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder"" (F19.180), ""Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder"" (F44.4), and ""Unspecified Anxiety Disorder"" (F41.9). While this list needs to be clear and concise, I must ensure it aligns with DSM-5-TR standards and presents the five most likely diagnoses accurately.

**Determining primary diagnoses**

I’m considering the patient's history of high-functioning ASD and depression to determine which diagnosis takes precedence. Although ASD is confirmed, the patient is currently on sertraline for depressive symptoms, which complicates things. I think we can list ""Unspecified Depressive Disorder"" (F32.9) as primary. For secondaries, I'll include ""Autism Spectrum Disorder"" (F84.0), ""Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder"" (F19.180), ""Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder"" (F44.4), and ""Unspecified Anxiety Disorder"" (F41.9). I’ll finalize this structured list.

**Finalizing diagnoses list**

Alright, I’m finalizing the structured list of diagnoses. Here’s what I have:

1. **Autism Spectrum Disorder** - F84.0  
2. **Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder** - F19.180  
3. **Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder (Conversion Disorder), with abnormal movement** - F44.4  
4. **Unspecified Anxiety Disorder** - F41.9  

I need to make sure to format it correctly and avoid any extra text or parentheses. I’ll keep the focus on clarity and ensure proper coding. Let’s wrap this up and output it as required!","1. Unspecified depressive disorder - F32.9

27,"We present an 18-year-old female with a past medical history of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS), chronic insomnia, and schizophrenia who presented to the outpatient adult neurology office. Her childhood was notable for extensive verbal abuse and neglect from her mother, leading to untreated trauma. Three months prior to this visit, the patient was admitted to an inpatient psychiatric facility due to a 9-month history of persecutory delusions, auditory hallucinations, and blunted affect. She was diagnosed with paranoid-subtype schizophrenia and started on Haloperidol 5 mg twice a day. During her stay at the inpatient facility, she had multiple epileptic episodes; she was diagnosed with epilepsy and prescribed Lamotrigine. She initially started a dose of 25 mg once a day for 2 weeks and gradually increased to 50 mg once a day.

The patient scheduled the initial appointment for the chief concern of tremor. She described it as bilateral, occurring at rest and with action, and starting days after beginning Haloperidol. She described her schizophrenia as being well-controlled with the haloperidol and found the medication effective. Her vitals were within normal limits. Her physical exam was benign and only significant for akathisia and blunted affect. Specifically, on a neurological exam, she had intact cranial nerves I–XII, no focal sensory deficits, no motor strength deficits, and symmetric 2+/4+ deep tendon reflexes. Given the context, the tremor was likely an extrapyramidal side effect of Haloperidol. We consulted psychiatry, who recommended either decreasing the dose of haloperidol or switching to a second-generation atypical antipsychotic. The patient preferred to continue taking Haloperidol so we decreased her dose to 3 mg twice a day.

During the same visit, the patient expressed concern that her Lamotrogine dose was “not helping” her seizures. She described her seizures as starting at the age of eight. The seizures usually occurred after stressful situations involving the patient's mother. During the episodes, the patient loses motor control and falls to the ground with bilateral arm and limb shaking. She remains conscious during the episodes. Her uncle, present at the initial visit, described the episodes similarly and relayed that she kept her eyes closed and shook her head throughout the episodes. She did not bite her tongue, express incontinence, or have postictal confusion. Most lasted between “2–4 minutes.”

Even with the antiepileptic medication, the seizures continued to occur “every few weeks.” The patient was never treated for epilepsy before her inpatient stay 6 months ago. Since this visit focused on the patient's tremor, she was scheduled for a follow-up in a week regarding her seizures and told to continue to take the medications and call if she had another episode. She was also prescribed orders to draw routine labs.",Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures (PNES),case_reports_in_psychiatry,"**Listing potential diagnoses**

I need to come up with five possible diagnoses. One option could be ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder"" and maybe ""Other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder"" linked to PANDAS? But I'm not sure if those are adequately described. ""Unspecified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder"" might fit too, as could ""Unspecified tic disorder."" I'm thinking we should consider ""History of abuse and neglect leading to untreated trauma,"" suggesting possible PTSD. However, it needs to focus on the top five most likely diagnoses based on available information.

**Structuring potential diagnoses**

I think I might include ""Schizophrenia"" as the primary diagnosis, followed by ""Functional neurological symptom disorder with seizures"" as the secondary, then ""Posttraumatic stress disorder,"" ""Insomnia disorder,"" and lastly, ""Schizoaffective disorder"" as another option. The user seems to want a structured list of DSM-5-TR diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes, focusing on the top five that are the most likely. It's essential to ensure the coding aligns with this. I’ll list the plausible differential diagnoses without extra reasoning.

**Analyzing the case details**

I need to analyze the vignette carefully. It involves an 18-year-old female with a history of PANDAS, chronic insomnia, and schizophrenia who recently visited outpatient neurology. Three months before her visit, she was admitted to inpatient psychiatry for persecutory delusions and hallucinations, diagnosed with paranoid-type schizophrenia and started on haloperidol. During her stay, she had epileptic episodes and was given lamotrigine. Now she’s at the neurology appointment for a tremor that began after starting haloperidol, mentioning lamotrigine isn't effective for her seizures.

**Evaluating seizure episodes**

There's no tongue biting, incontinence, or postictal confusion, and the seizures last 2-4 minutes, occurring every few weeks despite medication. I noticed an inconsistency regarding her inpatient stay—she was first said to have been admitted three months ago, but now it’s six months. I should consider whether her episodes are epileptic or psychogenic. The features—triggered by stress, eyes closed, and preserved consciousness—suggest psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES). I also need to note the chronic insomnia and potential connections to trauma.

**Choosing potential diagnoses**

I need to focus on the provided information, noting that PANDAS is a medical diagnosis with potential psychiatric manifestations. The question prohibits non-psychiatric diagnoses without F-codes, but I might include ""Obsessive-compulsive disorder"" (F42) as secondary due to the history of PANDAS, which includes OCD and tic disorders. The top five diagnoses I’m considering are:

1. Schizophrenia (F20.9)
2. Functional neurological symptom disorder (F44.5)
3. Insomnia disorder (F51.01)
4. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (F42)
5. Posttraumatic stress disorder (F43.10)

This should reflect a structured response based on the vignette details.

**Identifying potential diagnoses**

I’m considering ""paranoid-subtype schizophrenia"" with F20.0 as appropriate, but I might also code it as F20.9 under DSM-5-TR. I’ll look at the potential diagnoses based on the details given: 

1. Schizophrenia (F20.9)
2. Functional neurological symptom disorder with attacks or seizures (F44.5)
3. Posttraumatic stress disorder (F43.10)
4. Insomnia disorder (F51.0)
5. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (F42) or tic disorder (F95.9 if relevant).

I’ll prioritize these to reflect the most likely scenarios based on her history and symptoms.

**Defining diagnoses with F-codes**

I'm organizing potential diagnoses for the case at hand, prioritizing those that apply based on the information provided. For schizophrenia, I’ll use F20.0 as it aligns with the description given. 

1. Schizophrenia - F20.0
2. Functional neurological symptom disorder with attacks or seizures - F44.5
3. Nonorganic insomnia - F51.0
4. Obsessive-compulsive disorder - F42 (or possibly F42.9)
5. Unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder - F43.9

I think this structure best represents the case, given the historical context and symptoms described.

**Selecting diagnoses with F-codes**

I'm considering the most likely diagnoses based on the provided information while focusing on the required F-codes. 

1. Schizophrenia - F20.0
2. Functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder) with seizures - F44.5
3. Nonorganic insomnia - F51.0
4. Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder - F43.9
5. Obsessive-compulsive disorder - F42

This organization reflects the case and the top choices, even though some may have uncertainties. It's all about the best-fit diagnoses based on the symptoms described.

**Finalizing diagnoses and F-codes**

I’m working on compiling the top five most likely diagnoses based on the case details and including their corresponding F-codes. Here’s what I’ve got:

1. Schizophrenia - F20.0
2. Functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder) with attacks or seizures - F44.5
3. Obsessive-compulsive disorder - F42.9

28,"A 12-year-old girl presented with an acute onset of a 1month history of recurrent undesired and intrusive thoughts demanding her to repeat or stop doing certain behaviors to prevent unrelated danger (killing herself or going out in the street). She has stopped eating. The family frequently visited the emergency room (ER) to administer intravenous (IV) fluids. She started dressing and redressing for around 1 hr, repeated washing for around 1 hr, crossing her hands and scratching the wall, and crying and fearing killing herself or going out in the street. Family history: living with her mother. Her father passed away 2 years before presentation due to a medical illness. There is no history of mental illness in the family. She was doing well in school but had frequent absences in the last month before the presentation. Pregnancy, birth, and early development are unremarkable. Medical history: in this initial visit, the family denied the patient had any medical illnesses. The impression was that the patient had OCD. The treatment was SSRI and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). However, because of the acute onset and severity of her symptoms, the patient was reevaluated in follow-up with consideration of possible pediatric acute neuropsychiatric syndrome. She reported that she had recurrent tonsillitis in the last year before presentation, and her last infection was just before the start of her symptoms. Her recurrent tonsillitis was severe to the extent that a tonsillectomy was advised 6-month ago. The obsessive thoughts were associated with symptoms of separation anxiety, being forgetful, and abnormal sensations (tingling sensation) in her palms and feet. She repeats wearing her shoes because of these abnormal sensations.",Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS),case_reports_in_psychiatry,"**Analyzing psychiatric diagnoses**

I should consider including ""Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder"" as the primary diagnosis. Although ""Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition"" can't co-occur with OCD, I still want to list it as a potential differential. The user asked for a structured list of the top five most likely DSM-5-TR diagnoses, so I’ll include four additional plausible secondary diagnoses. I need to analyze carefully to select the best four diagnoses to support this with clarity.

**Evaluating the case of OCD**

I’m analyzing a case of a 12-year-old girl with acute onset OCD symptoms, including distressing intrusive thoughts that compel her to repeat behaviors to prevent perceived dangers. She has stopped eating, leading to frequent ER visits for IV fluids. The family history shows significant losses, but no mental illness. Her school performance dropped, and her physical examinations were unremarkable. Given her symptoms’ severity, I’m considering the possibility of pediatric acute neuropsychiatric syndrome as a reevaluation. I'll suggest treatment with SSRIs and CBT.

**Assessing PANS and OCD**

I’m evaluating a case with a history of severe recurrent tonsillitis, where tonsillectomy was recommended. The girl exhibits obsessive thoughts associated with separation anxiety and abnormal tingling sensations in her hands and feet, leading to compulsive behaviors like repeatedly putting on shoes. This suggests a core issue of obsessions, compulsions, and significant functional impairment. PANS could be a consideration due to the abrupt onset of OCD and restrictive eating following infection. I’ll note that while it may fit PANS, DSM criteria could lead to a diagnosis of OCD linked to a medical condition.

**Deciding between diagnoses**

At the time of evaluation, PANS was considered but not confirmed; I might list it as a differential diagnosis, although OCD seems to be the top diagnosis based on the information given. I should likely list ""Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder"" (OCD) as the primary diagnosis. There's also ""Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition"" (F06.8) as an alternative, but listing both could be redundant. The acute onset tied to infection suggests PANS, which could indicate that OCD is due to a medical condition. Ultimately, I need to determine the most appropriate diagnosis here for the structured list.

**Determining psychiatric diagnoses**

While evaluating, it’s important to focus on the psychiatric diagnosis and not strictly incorporate PANS as a medical condition. I could list ""Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder"" (OCD) as the primary diagnosis since symptoms are significant. There's consideration for ""OCD due to another medical condition,"" but we must avoid redundancy. Since the question asks for a structured list of DSM-5-TR diagnoses, I’ll focus on top 5 likely diagnoses, potentially including OCD and related disorders without specifying ""suspected."" I'll also consider secondary diagnoses like separation anxiety or avoidance disorders but might avoid including vague categories.

**Identifying potential diagnoses**

I’m trying to finalize a list of top 5 psychiatric diagnoses. ""Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder"" (OCD) seems to be the primary candidate along with ""Separation Anxiety Disorder"" as a secondary. For the third, I might go with ""Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder."" The fourth could be ""Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder due to another medical condition,"" and the fifth could be ""Unspecified Anxiety Disorder."" It’s crucial to ensure I capture the nuances without over-complicating the list with too many options. Keeping it clear and concise is my goal!

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

I'm refining my top 5 psychiatric diagnoses based on the information. My primary candidate is ""Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder"" (OCD), with ""Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder due to another medical condition"" as a secondary diagnosis, given the possible influence of PANS/PANDAS. I'll also include ""Separation Anxiety Disorder,"" ""Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder,"" and an ""Unspecified Anxiety Disorder"" to cover acute anxiety symptoms. I'm ensuring that the list reflects the most likely diagnoses and assigning appropriate F-codes. It's important to maintain clarity while following required structures!

**Refining psychiatric diagnosis list**

I’m refining the top five likely DSM-5 psychiatric diagnoses along with their appropriate ICD-10 F-codes. First, the primary diagnosis is ""Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Mixed Obsessional Thoughts and Acts"" at F42.2. For the four secondary diagnoses, I’ll include ""Separation Anxiety Disorder"" (F93.0), ""Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder"" (F50.82), ""Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition"" (F06.8), and ""Unspecified Anxiety Disorder"" (F41.9). This should reflect the most plausible diagnosis options while adhering to guidelines!

**Selecting differential diagnoses**

I’m considering the top diagnoses for the user's case, noting that the primary diagnosis is ""Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.8). For secondary diagnoses, I want to include ""Separation Anxiety Disorder"" (F93.0), ""Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder"" (F50.82), and ""Other Specified Anxiety Disorder"" (F41.8) to capture acute symptoms. I’m also thinking about adding ""Unspecified Anxiety Disorder"" (F41.9) or an unspecified depressive disorder, but I need to ensure they fit the criteria without redundancy.

**Deciding on diagnoses**

I’m weighing the different diagnoses for the user’s situation. The primary diagnosis is ""Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder with mixed obsessional thoughts and acts"" (F42.2). For the secondary diagnoses, I’m considering options like ""Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.8), ""Separation Anxiety Disorder"" (F93.0), ""Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder"" (F50.82), and ""Unspecified Anxiety Disorder"" (F41.9) or ""Other Specified Anxiety Disorder"" (F41.8) to capture various anxiety symptoms. I need to finalize which ones accurately reflect the details provided without redundancy.

**Identifying potential diagnoses**

I’m evaluating potential diagnoses based on the information given. While separation anxiety seems relevant, I can't confirm it meets the diagnostic criteria due to insufficient symptoms, yet I can include it as a secondary consideration. For Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID), the fact that she’s stopped eating and requires IV fluids supports its plausibility. However, if her eating issues stem from OCD, it complicates things. I need to choose five diagnoses and ensure to provide proper ICD-10 codes for the best representations.

**Listing potential diagnoses**

I'm considering possible diagnoses and need to finalize my list based on the patient's symptoms and information provided. For the primary diagnosis, I will use ""Obsessive-compulsive disorder"" - F42.2. The secondary might include ""Obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition"" - F06.8. I can also list ""Separation anxiety disorder"" - F93.0 and ""Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder"" - F50.82. Lastly, I will choose ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" - F41.8 as it seems most fitting given the circumstances.

**Refining diagnosis list**

I'm considering how to classify the patient's intrusive thoughts. They seem more like obsessions rather than hallucinations, which leads me to favor ""Obsessive-compulsive disorder"" - F42.2 as the primary. For the second diagnosis, I’ll note ""Obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition"" - F06.8. Then, I believe ""Separation anxiety disorder"" - F93.0 is vital to include. Following that, I’ll list ""Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder"" - F50.82. Lastly, I think I'll finalize with ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" - F41.9, given the severe anxiety present.

**Structuring diagnoses**

To meet Level 5 requirements, I plan to include ""Obsessive-compulsive disorder"" - F42.2 and ""Obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition"" - F06.8 for PANS capture. Then, I'll add ""Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder"" - F50.82, and ""Separation anxiety disorder"" - F93.0. Finally, I think ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" - F41.9 fits well as the fifth diagnosis. I need to ensure the final answer is structured correctly without any extra commentary. Here’s the organized list.","1. Obsessive-compulsive disorder, mixed obsessional thoughts and acts - F42.2

30,"A 44-year-old female patient, without a personal or family history of psychiatric illness, was admitted to a psychiatric ward for a psychotic episode which has started three days before, characterized by perplexity, self-referent and mystical delusions, irritability, disorganized behavior, and aggressiveness, that had emerged shortly after a cluster of nocturnal GTC seizures. Neither Schneider's first-rank symptoms nor negative symptoms of schizophrenia were present. Additionally, some degree of mental confusion with temporal disorientation, as well as sustained, divided attention and memory deficits were noticed during psychiatric hospitalization. Past medical history was relevant for epilepsy since her early thirties, which had developed after a moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). She did not regularly attend follow-up neurology appointments and had poor adherence to antiepileptic treatment. Ancillary tests undergone during a previous hospitalization in a neurology ward (seven years before the hospitalization in psychiatry) had documented a focal slowing activity in the left frontotemporal topography on electroencephalogram (EEG) and a right cortico-subcortical parietooccipital lesion of encephalomalacia on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Additionally, she presented an amnestic mild cognitive impairment, possibly secondary to both the poorly controlled epilepsy and the prior TBI.

I’m considering how to classify a psychotic disorder. There are certainly medical conditions we could attribute, but if unsure, we could label it as unspecified. The user asks for the top five likely conditions; I could include ""Unspecified psychotic disorder"" but might prefer ""Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition"" as primary. For secondary, I could add ""Delirium"" and ""Mild cognitive disorder."" I need to carefully parse these details to get accurate classifications.

**Summarizing a psychotic episode**

I’m looking at the case of a 44-year-old woman with no personal or family psychiatric history. She was admitted for a psychotic episode that started three days prior, characterized by perplexity, self-referential and mystical delusions, irritability, and disorganized behavior, all emerging after a series of nocturnal seizures. There weren’t any first-rank or negative symptoms of schizophrenia. It's also noteworthy that she has a past medical history of epilepsy and cognitive impairment, likely linked to her seizures and previous traumatic brain injury.

**Examining types of psychosis**

I’m considering different types of psychosis that could apply here. Postictal psychosis usually shows up within a week after a seizure cluster, lasting days to weeks, with symptoms like delusions or agitation. In this case, it started shortly after her generalized tonic-clonic seizures. There's a possibility of ictal psychosis occurring during seizures, but that typically includes impaired consciousness. Interictal psychosis isn't relevant since it’s chronic. Delirium could also be a factor due to confusion and attention deficits, though it has distinct symptoms that need to be considered.

**Identifying potential diagnoses**

I’m analyzing the sustained psychotic symptoms in this case and how they might relate to attention deficits and mental confusion observed during hospitalization. While she shows some confusion and disorientation, it’s unclear whether this meets full delirium criteria since there's no mention of fluctuations in consciousness. Given her background of epilepsy, I’ve outlined my top five diagnoses: 1) Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition, 2) Delirium, 3) Mild cognitive disorder, 4) Brief psychotic disorder, and 5) Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum disorder, as the other options might not fit the criteria.

**Listing potential diagnoses**

I’m working on identifying the top five psychiatric diagnoses for this case while adhering to the guidelines. I’ll include: 1) Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition (F06.2), 2) Delirium due to another medical condition (F05), 3) Mild cognitive disorder (F06.7), 4) Brief psychotic disorder (F23), and 5) Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder (F29). It's essential to stick to the relevant DSM-5-TR codes and not include any additional reasoning in the final output.

32,"J is a mid-20s military service member living independently in the community with a partner. J has a history of multiple ACEs (ACE scale score of 10/10), with caregivers that were both physically and emotionally abusive when J's needs were voiced, resulting in a belief that it was unacceptable, unsafe, and futile to resolve interpersonal problems with caregivers, thus creating a sense of powerlessness and helplessness. Child and family services were never involved, and no legal charges were ever laid against the family for the abuse that J endured. J struggled with containing anger since early childhood resulting in physical and verbal aggression towards peers and teachers at school and family members at home. Caregivers attempted to contain J's aggressive behavior through forced administration of psychiatric medication. While growing up, J feared others and preferred to be alone, despite longing for family and friends. Socialization with peers proved difficult, as J was easily overwhelmed by noise associated with social contact and was frequently ridiculed or misunderstood while trying to verbally communicate.

As a young adult, J left family to enter the military, which became an immediate source of attachment and social belonging. More recently, J became increasingly unable to cope with anger following an ill-suited work position and a musculoskeletal injury, resulting in frequent angry verbal altercations and threats of violence towards military peers who placed restrictions on his activities. This led to disciplinary action and isolation from the unit, which further increased anger, hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts and led to a psychiatric military assessment. During the assessment, J disclosed feelings of intense anger which eventually manifested in an attack on a family member in an amnestic dissociated state. J's history indicated that pharmacological treatments had either been ineffective or caused significant side effects. The military psychiatrist determined J ought to be considered for military discharge. This triggered flashbacks of past childhood abuse and a significant increase in rage. J refused trials of psychiatric medications in the community due to a childhood history of forced medication administration. Due to significant safety concerns and limited ability to control aggressive behavior in the community, J's military psychiatrist referred J for an inpatient admission.

On initial assessment for admission, J appeared distrustful, angry, and concerned about acting out on anger and expressed suicidal ideation. On mental status examination, J was tall and appeared neatly dressed in a military uniform. J appeared hypervigilant and intensely watchful and was well spoken, using a “sharp” tone of voice. J provided a detailed history, demonstrating a goal-directed thought form and a high level of abstract thinking, logical analysis, and good recall. There were no delusions or hallucinations, but J endorsed prominent active suicidal ideation, with intent to act upon these thoughts if not hospitalized; however, there were no immediate, specific suicide plans.","Autism Spectrum Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Unspecified Anxiety Disorder, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)",case_reports_in_psychiatry,"**Deciding on codes**

I'm ranking some mental health disorders by their ICD-10 F-codes. First is posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as F43.10, then intermittent explosive disorder as F63.81, and next is dissociative amnesia at F44.0. For unspecified depressive disorder, I'm considering F32.A, but that might not be widely accepted, so F32.9 could be safer. Yet, F32.9 might confuse it with major depressive disorder. Unspecified depressive disorder definitely feels like the more accurate choice. Let’s keep thinking!

**Analyzing symptoms and codes**

The vignette mentions ""increased anger, hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts,"" which suggest depressive symptoms, yet it doesn't confirm a depressed mood. Unspecified depressive disorder feels plausible, with the F32.A code aligning well. However, I’m concerned the user might prefer codes with decimals, but that might not be essential. Then, I consider autism spectrum disorder (F84.0) vs. social anxiety disorder (F40.10). There are signs pointing toward ASD, like noise sensitivity and communication issues, though I'm hesitant because I don't see the typical restricted interests present. Social anxiety could explain the fear and isolation. Hm, it’s tricky!

**Evaluating potential diagnoses**

Given the high level of abstract thinking and communication skills, this individual could still qualify for ASD Level 1. We need to see evidence of early symptoms and significant social impairment, which could indicate difficulties. There’s also sensory sensitivity to noise, but that alone might not be enough. Social (pragmatic) communication disorder could be a more fitting option, especially if restricted or repetitive behaviors aren’t evident. However, I’m considering social anxiety disorder as well since there's fear of social interaction combined with a desire for connection. It's a nuanced situation!

**Evaluating potential diagnoses**

For the fifth diagnosis, I'm considering either social anxiety disorder or autism spectrum disorder. The evidence is a bit ambiguous, so I need to dive deeper. J seemed to fear others and preferred solitude, indicating social anxiety. While longing for friendships suggests a desire for connection, in ASD, misunderstandings often occur without the central fear. The challenges with noise suggest sensory sensitivity which might lean toward ASD, but the communication difficulties could also point to pragmatic language issues. It's an intricate puzzle!

**Mapping potential diagnoses**

I'm weighing several diagnoses. First, I consider PTSD due to his hypervigilance and distrust stemming from early trauma. Then, Intermittent Explosive Disorder could apply because of aggressive outbursts. I think Dissociative Amnesia fits too since he can't recall his violent incident. Unspecified depressive disorder is another candidate, likely coded as F32.A. Lastly, I'm torn between social anxiety disorder and autism spectrum disorder—both could contribute, but social anxiety seems less prominent now. It’s complicated!

**Identifying potential diagnoses**

I'm sorting through various potential diagnoses. I've settled on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) as the primary, given the signs of hypervigilance and trauma. Following that, I’ll list Intermittent Explosive Disorder due to the recurrent aggressive outbursts, then Dissociative Amnesia because of the inability to recall a violent episode. Unspecified Depressive Disorder is included too, alongside Autism Spectrum Disorder as a provisional diagnosis, based on some relevant symptoms and historical context. The final list will reflect the most likely diagnoses succinctly.

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

I’m thinking through the diagnoses. It looks like I’ll keep Posttraumatic Stress Disorder as the primary diagnosis due to the significant indications of trauma and hypervigilance. Following that, I’ll include Intermittent Explosive Disorder as the second. The third will be Dissociative Amnesia, followed by Unspecified Depressive Disorder, and finally, Autism Spectrum Disorder. I want to be precise with the terminology and include the correct codes. I’ll ensure this is just the list with no reasoning attached.","1. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) - F43.10

33,"Our patient was a 41-year-old man with diagnoses of schizoaffective disorder and polysubstance use disorder who was admitted to the inpatient psychiatry unit after an extended stay (24 days) in the psychiatric emergency department, where he presented with manic and psychotic symptoms, including mood lability, pressured speech, grandiosity, paranoia, and disorganized thinking, in the context of medication noncompliance and elopement from his group home. His prolonged psychiatric emergency department course was due to difficulty finding an available inpatient psychiatric bed at or within a reasonable radius of the receiving hospital. Per the patient's guardian, medications confirmed 6 weeks prior to admission included divalproex extended-release (ER) 500 mg twice daily, clonazepam 0.5 mg twice daily, risperidone 4 mg twice daily, risperidone microspheres long-acting injection 25 mg every 2 weeks, quetiapine 400 mg daily, and trazodone 100 mg daily. Based on the fill history and patient report, nonadherence was likely in the weeks prior to admission.

Limited information was available regarding the patient's past psychiatric history, as he was a difficult historian due to his mental state at the time of the initial assessment, as noted above. From a review of available records, he was noted to have been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder in his early twenties and to have been prescribed multiple medications at various points to address manic and psychotic symptoms, including risperidone (up to 8 mg per day of the oral form and up to 25 mg every 14 days of the long-acting injectable form), quetiapine (up to 400 mg per day), and divalproex (up to 1500 mg per day). He was also prescribed trazodone for sleep (up to 50 mg per day) and sertraline for anxiety (unclear dose and duration per records). A note was made of at least partial response to risperidone and divalproex for manic and psychotic symptoms, though the durability of these effects was difficult to assess due to poor compliance. Records documented a history of over 30 psychiatric hospitalizations, usually in the setting of medication noncompliance leading to symptom relapse, with two such hospitalizations in the year prior to presentation. Mention was also made of a suicide attempt three years prior to the presentation, though the circumstances of this were unclear (the patient had reported this to an emergency room provider at an outside hospital; he denied any such history on evaluation in our psychiatric emergency room).

A history of “semi-regular” use of alcohol and cannabis was also noted in his records, beginning in his early twenties, though specific amounts, frequency, adverse consequences, and any treatment for substance use were not documented. Notably, his urine toxicology screen was negative at the time of presentation to our psychiatric emergency room.

Medically, a history of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (for which the patient had refused treatment with medications) was noted, with the last documented CD4 count being in the 430s range at an outside hospital one year prior to presentation.

Family history was significant for schizophrenia and suicide in a maternal uncle. In terms of social history, records indicated that the patient was an only child and that his parents separated when he was an infant; he was noted to have had no relationship with his father. He reported no history of domestic or family conflicts but also noted no current social support at the time of presentation. There was no documented history of his experiencing physical or sexual abuse, though he referred in a prior emergency room visit to a history of “verbal abuse” (unclear how long ago or by whom). He was also noted to have been married in the past but separated for 20 years prior to the presentation; he had no children. He was noted to have lived in numerous group homes over the prior ten years due to mental health issues, with frequent periods of homelessness between these stays, including for three days prior to presentation after he had absconded from his last group home due to paranoid concerns about the staff and residents there. Educationally, he was noted to have completed high school and college but to have been unemployed for ten years prior to presentation, receiving disability income, and having a guardian appointed to him due to mental health issues.

Physical examination upon initial presentation in the psychiatric emergency room was unremarkable other than the patient appearing disheveled, irritable, and guarded. Vital signs were within normal limits. Laboratory tests, including electrolytes, liver function tests, complete blood count, thyroid function tests, urine analysis, and urine drug screen, were all within normal limits.

On mental status examination, he showed loud, pressured speech, guarded and labile affect, irritable and elevated mood, disorganized (tangential, loose) thinking, paranoid delusions that staff and residents at the group home where he had been living were involved in a conspiracy against him, no reported suicidal or homicidal ideation, and poor insight (e.g., denying that he had any mental health issues and that he only needed sertraline to “clear his head”).",Treatment-refractory schizoaffective disorder ,case_reports_in_psychiatry,"**Clarifying diagnostic codes**

I realize that ICD-10 codes differentiate between various conditions, like F10.10 for mild alcohol use disorder and F10.20 for moderate to severe. The DSM-5 uses ""use disorder"" with severity specifiers. The remission specifier doesn’t alter the code. I can apply the same logic for cannabis and possibly include issues like benzodiazepine use disorder. I consider adding ""Unspecified bipolar and related disorder"" (F31.9) but need to stick to the top five diagnoses and their relevant codes.

**Selecting diagnostic codes**

I’m breaking down the diagnoses now. For bipolar I disorder with a current manic episode and psychotic features, it's F31.2. Next is schizophrenia, which is F20.9. As for cannabis use disorder, I’m uncertain between F12.20 and a more general F19.20 for polysubstance use disorder. The records indicate semi-regular use of both alcohol and cannabis, so I should classify them separately as ""Cannabis use disorder, unspecified"" for #4 and ""Alcohol use disorder, unspecified"" for #5. I need to pick codes that align well with these choices.

**Reviewing diagnosis instructions**

I need to revisit the instructions for diagnosing the clinical case vignette. I should provide a structured list of the top five DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses, with corresponding ICD-10 F-codes. We've already confirmed that schizoaffective disorder and polysubstance use disorder should be included. I also need to account for the current manic/psychotic episode related to medication noncompliance, which fits under schizoaffective disorder. I may consider ""Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder"" or ""Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder,"" although that last one seems less likely. I have to focus on the most relevant diagnoses for the case.

**Assessing diagnosis guidelines**

I need to follow the instructions closely: I can't provide clinical reasoning or qualifiers like ""rule out"" in my response. Instead, I should list the top five diagnoses with their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes. I have to consider the distinctions between schizoaffective disorder, bipolar I with psychotic features, and schizophrenia. Schizoaffective disorder requires a mood episode alongside psychotic symptoms lasting at least two weeks. Since we have prominent manic symptoms, it could lean towards bipolar I, but without more details, it's tricky. I need to choose the most accurate diagnoses.

**Deciding on psychiatric diagnoses**

I've analyzed the situation and need to determine the proper diagnoses. The DSM-5 mentions ""Unspecified alcohol-related disorder"" (F10.99) but may not be the best fit when there's semi-regular use without clear disorder. I must include substance use disorders due to the patient's history. I'll consider ""Other (or unknown) substance use disorder"" (F19.20) to represent polysubstance use accurately. My final choices for the top five diagnoses will likely include schizoaffective disorder, cannabis use disorder, alcohol use disorder, bipolar I with psychotic features, and schizophrenia, all in the order of plausibility.

**Choosing psychiatric diagnoses**

I need to solidify the diagnoses according to the guidelines. We can include schizoaffective disorder and bipolar I with psychotic features, but I have to watch for overlap with schizophrenia. I must also provide a structured list of the top five diagnoses. It's viable to include cannabis use disorder and alcohol use disorder due to the patient's histories. The relevant ICD-10 F-codes would be: F25.0 for schizoaffective disorder, F31.2 for bipolar I with psychotic features, F20.9 for schizophrenia, F12.20 for cannabis use disorder, and F10.20 for alcohol use disorder.

**Selecting substance use diagnoses**

I need to properly address the substance use diagnoses. Since the patient has a history with alcohol and cannabis, I can use different codes like F19.20 for polysubstance use. However, while polysubstance usage doesn’t have an exact diagnosis in DSM-5, I can interpret it as various substance use disorders. 

My top five likely diagnoses will include schizoaffective disorder (bipolar type), bipolar I disorder, and schizophrenia, while also considering substance use disorders. Though we have limited evidence, I can reasonably include them without over-diagnosing.

**Selecting diagnostic codes**

I’m sorting through the appropriate DSM-5 codes for the various disorders. For Bipolar I disorder with severe manic episodes and psychotic features, I can confidently use F31.2. Schizophrenia gets the code F20.9. For cannabis use disorder, I could choose F12.20 for moderate/severe or F12.10 for mild. Alcohol use disorder could be coded as F10.20 for moderate/severe. Based on the patient's history, I’ll list top diagnosable conditions focusing on schizoaffective and mood-related disorders along with substance use.

**Determining substance use disorder codes**

I’m considering the most appropriate diagnosis codes. We could use ""Other (or unknown) substance use disorder"" (F19.20) to reflect uncertainty, but we need five diagnoses. Including polysubstance use is essential since it’s documented, so we might zone in on ""Cannabis use disorder"" and ""Alcohol use disorder"" with moderate/severe codes. However, since there’s insufficient detail, we could also list them as mild (F10.10, F12.10) instead to avoid assumptions. It's tricky, but I want to ensure accuracy in presenting these codes!

**Evaluating substance diagnoses**

I’m thinking about mild codes that require at least two criteria. It might be tempting to assume that “semi-regular use” is enough, but that doesn't guarantee it. The term “polysubstance use disorder” suggests at least two substances. A better way might be looking at ""Other specified substance-related and addictive disorder"" F19.99. However, I still want to include the top five diagnoses. I think I should list alcohol and cannabis individually rather than using a general code like F19.

**Selecting diagnoses**

I’m considering including ""Other psychoactive substance use disorder"" as a secondary diagnosis since the individual had ""polysubstance use disorder"" but not enough details. To finalize, I think I can include bipolar I and schizophrenia along with cannabis and alcohol use disorders, but that feels like too many. So, let's ensure we have exactly five lines in our output. I’ll organize them carefully: 

1. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type - F25.0  
2. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features - F31.2  
3. Schizophrenia - F20.9  
4. Cannabis use disorder - F12.20 (or F12.10)  
5. Alcohol use disorder - F10.20 (or F10.10)  

I’m considering how to prioritize the substance use disorders since they are comorbid rather than alternatives.

**Ranking likely diagnoses**

I’m thinking about ranking the diagnoses by likelihood. Maybe schizoaffective disorder is most likely; then cannabis and alcohol use disorders; followed by bipolar I and schizophrenia as alternatives. Although mania with psychosis could add a twist. They want the top five diagnoses. Comorbidity is probable, but there are also alternative possibilities. 

I’m considering this order:  
1. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type - F25.0  
2. Other psychoactive substance use disorder (polysubstance use disorder) - F19.20  
3. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features - F31.2  
4. Schizophrenia - F20.9  
5. I wonder if I need cannabis use disorder separately since polysubstance is already included. But including alcohol use disorder could give me two more options.

**Considering secondary diagnoses**

I’m working through including bipolar I and schizophrenia, which gives me four secondary diagnoses. It might make sense, but I’m wondering if these are less likely than substance use disorders. Given the patient’s age, 41, and history of 30 hospitalizations, it points to severe chronic mental illness. While substance use could be present, the negative urine toxicology suggests it might not be active. 

I'm thinking of possibly including ""Cannabis use disorder in sustained remission"" and ""Alcohol use disorder in sustained remission"" based on the history, but it's unclear if it fits without more information on whether he stopped using.

**Finalizing diagnosis details**

Negative toxicology suggests the patient isn't currently using cannabis, but it could still be in their system, as it can linger for days or weeks. However, based on this, I’m thinking we may not need to include cannabinoid and alcohol use disorders when finalizing our list. We need five diagnoses, but adding “Unspecified anxiety disorder” or “Tobacco use disorder” doesn’t feel right either. 

I want to ensure the diagnosis names follow DSM-5-TR standards, including severity for cannabis and alcohol use. Deciding on labels is important, but limited data makes it tricky. I might lean towards “mild” for both due to previous diagnoses suggesting at least mild impairment. However, it’s all somewhat uncertain!","1. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type - F25.0

34,"An 82-year old married female from Hindu nuclear family with history of Alzheimer's dementia in first degree relative, was treated for depression 9 months prior presentation on the outpatient basis.

I'm looking into whether medications relate to the F10-F19 categories, and it seems there's a mistake since those categories don't include all medications. The DSM-5 indicates using F19.94 for substance-induced disorders. If a medication falls outside ICD classifications, that code is used. I find there's also F06.33 for bipolar due to another medical condition. However, I realize F31.9 refers to unspecified bipolar disorder. I’ll need to prioritize the top five.

**Examining the vignette details**

I’m carefully parsing the vignette regarding an 82-year-old married woman from a Hindu nuclear family. There's a family history of Alzheimer's dementia, but she had a past psychiatric history of depression that resolved after treatment. Recently, she showcased symptoms like elevated mood, increased energy, and overspending for ten days, which isn’t typical behavior. However, four days before admission, she became confused and disoriented, leading to aggressive behavior at times and eventually requiring physical restraint upon arrival.

**Assessing patient symptoms**

I notice signs of stupor and echolalia, but no clear indicators of catatonia. The physical exam shows tachycardia, but everything else is normal; the neuro exam is limited due to agitation. The mental status examination reveals orientation issues and an irritable affect, along with a flight of ideas and a grandiosity delusion. All lab tests come back normal, and the scoring suggests she's likely experiencing delirious mania. In the DSM-5, it could be coded as Bipolar I disorder with associated delirium. However, I’m pondering the physiological causes needed for that diagnosis.

**Diagnosing delirious mania**

I’m considering how to approach the diagnosis when delirium occurs during mania. Practically, I might diagnose ""Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, with psychotic features,"" along with ""Delirium, unspecified"" to cover the delirium. However, it's tricky since labs are unremarkable, and while mania can lead to sleep deprivation and dehydration, those aren’t typical underlying conditions. In older adults, delirium typically suggests an underlying medical cause, like infection, but again, labs are normal. So, I could label it as mania with psychotic features complicated by delirium or just the specified bipolar disorder with psychotic features.

**Determining top diagnoses**

I'm dissecting the potential diagnoses for a case that includes mania and delirium. The key diagnosis could be ""Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features,"" followed by ""Delirium due to another medical condition."" We should also consider catatonia as a specifier. Additionally, ""Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition"" fits if mania is secondary to other health issues. Finally, I might include ""Major neurocognitive disorder"" to address possible cognitive decline. It's important to choose plausible diagnoses based on the information provided.

**Constructing a structured list**

The user has clarified not to include non-psychiatric diagnoses that lack F-codes; meaning I can't use mild neurocognitive disorder (G31.84). I'm focusing on the most likely diagnoses based on the case indicating delirious mania. The top five should include: 

1. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features - F31.2
2. Delirium due to another medical condition - F05
3. Catatonia associated with another mental disorder - F06.1
4. Bipolar disorder due to another medical condition with manic features - F06.33
5. Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar and Related Disorder - F19.94

This approach encapsulates relevant and plausible diagnoses without straying from the user's request.

**Identifying psychiatric diagnoses**

For differential diagnosis, I need to consider major depressive disorder (MDD), especially if the mania is medication-induced or linked to a medical condition. However, we need five diagnoses. Possible options include unspecified psychotic disorder and brief psychotic disorder, but those might be ruled out.

Delirium stands out, particularly since confusion was noticed. I could list these top five diagnoses: 

1. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features - F31.2
2. Delirium due to another medical condition - F05
3. Catatonia associated with bipolar disorder - F06.1
4. Major depressive disorder, single episode, in full remission - F32.5
5. Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar - F19.94 

This arrangement follows the requirement for a structured list while considering the differential nuances.

**Formulating potential diagnoses**

I’m considering various diagnoses, given the user’s instructions to provide the top five with ICD-10 F-codes. 

I could start with ""Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features"" as the primary diagnosis. Next, I would list ""Delirium"" (F05), ""Catatonia associated with bipolar disorder"" (F06.1), ""Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.33), and finally ""Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar and Related Disorder"" (F19.94).

This list takes into account both the primary and most plausible secondary diagnoses while ensuring ICD-10 codes are accurate.

**Identifying top diagnoses**

I'm weighing the potential diagnoses, especially around delirium and mania. I consider whether mania should be primary or if delirium could be the acute reason for hospitalization. 

I’ll list them considering their ICD-10 F-codes:  

1. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features - F31.2  
2. Delirium (due to another medical condition) - F05  
3. Catatonia associated with another mental disorder (bipolar disorder) - F06.1  
4. Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition - F06.33  
5. Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar and Related Disorder - F19.94  

This selection addresses the user’s needs while indicating plausible conditions for this case.

**Clarifying the appropriate diagnoses**

I'm really diving into substance-induced bipolar codes. F19.94 is suggested for substance-induced bipolar and related disorders, but I’m checking its validity against actual codes. Some valid alternatives like F31.9 or other bipolar codes are also on my mind. 

I can generate a final list of the top 5 diagnoses using ICD-10 F-codes, ensuring I choose ones I'm confident about, including:  

1. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features - F31.2  
2. Delirium (due to another medical condition) - F05  
3. Catatonia associated with another mental disorder - F06.1  
4. Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition - F06.33  
5. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition - F06.2   

This ensures accuracy and relevance while keeping it distinct.

**Finalizing potential diagnoses**

I'm considering the possibility that the symptoms could stem from an underlying medical condition or delirium. For example, I can include ""Mania due to another medical condition,"" but I want to focus on providing plausible top 5 diagnoses without fabrication.  

Here's my final list:  
1. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features - F31.2  
2. Delirium (hyperactive/mixed), due to another medical condition - F05  
3. Catatonia associated with another mental disorder - F06.1  
4. Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition - F06.33  
5. Major neurocognitive disorder, unspecified - F03.90  

This selection should be prudent and reflect my accuracy goal!

**Identifying top diagnoses**

I’m evaluating the possibility of including major neurocognitive disorder or a psychotic disorder due to a medical condition. I need to provide five plausible diagnoses, including ""Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features,"" ""Delirium due to another medical condition,” and ""Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition.""

I have to consider codes carefully. I'm leaning towards including “Major neurocognitive disorder, unspecified” (F03.90) because it only uses F-codes, which aligns with the user's guidelines. It seems like we can also list ""Delirious mania,"" as it effectively describes the current symptoms.

**Finalizing potential diagnoses**

I'm considering the primary diagnosis of ""Delirium due to another medical condition"" with ""Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic"" as a secondary option. Other possible diagnoses include acute psychosis due to delirium, dementia, and catatonia due to delirium. Catatonia might manifest here given the symptoms, so it could be coded as secondary. 

While major neurocognitive disorder (dementia) seems less likely due to no history of forgetfulness, I still want to include plausible options. So I’ll form a list of the top five diagnoses, ensuring they’re structured correctly and reflect what the user is looking for!

**Evaluating potential diagnoses**

I’m considering options for diagnosing the patient with symptoms suggestive of mania. I could code ""Substance-induced bipolar disorder,"" possibly using codes like F10.14 for alcohol-induced mood disorder. However, there isn't a specific code for substance-induced bipolar. The DSM-5 seems to use F19.94 as a general code for unspecified substance-induced disorders. 

Thinking through the differential diagnoses, I find ""Unspecified psychotic disorder"" (F29) to be plausible. While F29 is nonspecific, symptoms suggest bipolar I disorder is primary, given the absence of forgetfulness. So I’ll finalize these options carefully!

They recommended that her father take her to the emergency department (ED) for an evaluation. In the ED, the patient was disorganized and endorsed hallucinations, both auditory and visual. She was agitated and resistant to medical care. Her father petitioned for involuntary inpatient psychiatric admission, given the severity of her psychosis.

Patient returned to the United States 1 month prior to admission to give birth in the United States. Her condition acutely worsened during the week leading to admission.",Catatonia associated with schizoaffective disorder,case_reports_in_psychiatry,"**Analyzing diagnostic codes**

It seems that when discussing catatonia, I need to clarify the codes used in different diagnostic manuals. The DSM-5 has removed the catatonic subtype for schizophrenia but uses it as a specifier. For ICD-10-CM, F06.1 relates to catatonia linked to another disorder. Given the user's request for DSM-5-TR diagnoses, I think catatonia associated with a mental disorder can be considered, and I might list F06.1 as a secondary diagnosis while including relevant primary codes.

**Crafting differential diagnoses**

I need to create a list of differential diagnoses, starting with schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type—F25.0 as primary. Given the established history, there's a likelihood of relapse due to nonadherence to treatment, but medication nonadherence itself doesn’t carry an F-code. I could also consider bipolar I disorder with psychotic features. However, symptoms like disorganization and hallucinations make schizophrenia with catatonia a candidate. I must ensure my top five likely options don’t include non-psychiatric conditions.

**Considering possible diagnoses**

Given the known history of stabilization with antipsychotics and lithium, I suspect a relapse of schizoaffective disorder, which could explain the current psychosis and mood agitation. I should also consider catatonia associated with another mental disorder (F06.1) as a secondary diagnosis due to the presence of catatonia. Bipolar I disorder with a current manic episode and psychotic features (F31.2) is another possibility, even though symptoms are mostly agitation. Schizophrenia (F20.9) could apply if mood symptoms aren’t prominent.

**Defining possible diagnoses**

In ICD-10-CM, I have F20.9 for unspecified schizophrenia, or alternatively, I could consider F23 for brief psychotic disorder, but the user's chronic history since childhood makes that unlikely. Even postpartum psychosis doesn’t fit since she’s 20 weeks pregnant. Major depressive disorder with psychotic features isn't applicable either. Other options include schizoaffective disorder, unspecified type, or unspecified psychotic disorder (F29). I’ll finalize the top five: primary schizoaffective bipolar, catatonia, schizophrenia, bipolar I, and unspecified psychotic disorder, along with four secondary diagnoses, considering differentials or comorbidities.

**Creating the structured diagnosis list**

The user wants a structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses. For a 25-year-old female at 20 weeks pregnant with psychosis and catatonia, I’ll outline the top five likely diagnoses based on her history of schizoaffective disorder and current symptoms. 

1. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type (F25.0) is primary because of the relapse. 
2. Catatonia associated with schizoaffective disorder (F06.1). 
3. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic with psychotic features (F31.2).
4. Schizophrenia (F20.9).
5. Unspecified psychotic disorder (F29) may be included as it covers cases that don’t fit clear categories.

36,"Ms. T is a 34-year-old female with no significant past psychiatric history. She presented to the emergency department due to one month of worsening mood, inability to care for herself, hyperreligiosity, auditory hallucinations, and perseveration on the idea that she is going to hell. The patient reported auditory hallucinations in which she heard the voices of Satan or Saints. She reported anergia, amotivation, anhedonia, decreased appetite, and difficulty falling and staying asleep. The patient also had new-onset superficial cutting of her wrists. She was perseverating on the idea that she had become an apostate and was therefore going to hell. The patient denied suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, or visual hallucinations. The patient's family history was relevant for a maternal grandmother with schizophrenia. After evaluation in the emergency department, acute inpatient psychiatric hospitalization was recommended. Ms. T signed herself into the psychiatric hospital voluntarily for her first hospitalization. The patient's parents reported that this behavior was unusual and abrupt and that she was previously sociable and well-liked by her peers. The patient's symptoms started within 3 weeks of the patient contracting COVID-19 which was confirmed via PCR. They deny any similar symptoms or similar behavior in the past. Her parents report that the patient had taken a leave of absence from work as she was frequently calling them from work crying. They report that the patient's speech was childlike, as if she had regressed.","Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe with psychotic features",case_reports_in_psychiatry,"**Evaluating potential diagnoses**

The description indicates symptoms lasting for at least one month, which makes it tricky to include a brief psychotic disorder since it typically needs to be under a month. However, I think I can still consider it. For the diagnosis of psychotic disorder associated with another medical condition, evidence must show that it's linked to that condition directly. As for the top five diagnoses, I'm leaning toward Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features primary, then considering things like schizophreniform disorder and schizoaffective depressive type.

**Confirming diagnosis codes**

I’m confirming the codes for various disorders. For Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features, it’s F32.3. Next, there’s F20.81 for Schizophreniform Disorder. For psychotic disorders related to physiological conditions, we have two options: F06.0 for hallucinations and F06.2 for delusions. Since the individual presents both symptoms, we need to decide on the predominant feature. Given the vivid auditory hallucinations and delusions, I’m thinking F06.2 might be the better choice based on common mapping.

**Choosing diagnosis codes**

I realize that F06.2 for ""Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition with delusions"" can include hallucinations but focuses on delusions. Since she has prominent hallucinations, F06.0 is the right choice. 

Next, I consider F23 for Brief Psychotic Disorder and F25.1 for Schizoaffective Disorder, depressive type, and confirm the code for Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features is F32.3. It’s important to ensure I’m using the latest DSM-5-TR naming. I can reference the psychotic disorder as possibly related to post-COVID but note to avoid explicitly mentioning COVID-19.

**Evaluating psychiatric diagnoses**

I need to follow the instructions to provide a structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses without adding extra details. It’s fine to mention ""Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition"" generically. However, I should weigh ""Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features"" against ""Depressive disorder due to another medical condition,"" especially since the depressive symptoms began after COVID, but they can't be attributed directly. 

I’ll consider that maybe the primary diagnosis should be Schizophreniform Disorder, as the psychosis might be the main factor, with mood symptoms being secondary. It's essential to evaluate carefully based on the case details, including auditory hallucinations and the idea of going to hell.

**Finalizing diagnosis codes**

I’m compiling a structured list of DSM-5-TR diagnoses based on the details provided. The primary diagnosis is likely ""Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, severe with psychotic features"" (ICD-10 F32.3), given the presence of significant depressive symptoms along with psychotic features like auditory hallucinations of a religious nature, which seem mood-congruent. 

The secondary diagnoses will include:
1. Schizophreniform Disorder - ICD-10 F20.81
2. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition (with hallucinations) - ICD-10 F06.0
3. Brief Psychotic Disorder - ICD-10 F23
4. Schizoaffective Disorder, depressive type - ICD-10 F25.1

This should capture the top five most likely diagnoses accurately.","1. Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe with psychotic features - F32.3

37,"A 44-year-old Caucasian female was referred to our department of psychiatry by her neurosurgeon, after having been operated on a pituitary macroadenoma compressing the optic chiasm, for visual hallucinations.

She was married. She had no prior psychiatric history. She did not take any medication that could produce hallucinations.

On March 2019, the patient underwent transsphenoidal adenomectomy.

In the first postoperative day, the patient reported the persistence of visual hallucinations and was referred to our department of psychiatry one week later.

Upon arrival to our department, the patient was cooperative, did not verbalize delirium, and had no cognitive impairment. She reported visual hallucinations. These hallucinations appeared several times a day for variable periods of time and lasted a few minutes. They caused anxiety and insomnia. The patient reported that she was embarrassed by these hallucinations. She saw unfamiliar human faces with no other associated signs. These images did not speak, and the patient knew that the hallucinations were unreal.

The neurologic exam revealed no abnormalities. Her Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score was 28.",Charles Bonnet syndrome,case_reports_in_psychiatry,"**Clarifying psychiatric codes**

The user's request is technically focused on DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses, specifically F-codes, while recognizing that sleep-wake disorders typically use G codes from ICD-10-CM. For example, insomnia disorder maps to G47.00 and hypersomnolence to G47.10. But I need to stick to F-codes for diagnoses. I could include anxiety disorder due to known physiological condition (F06.4) or adjustment disorder with anxiety (F43.22). It seems that's the direction I should take for the user's needs.

**Identifying differential diagnoses**

I’m considering the secondary differential diagnoses here. First, there’s a psychotic disorder due to another medical condition (F06.0), and delirium (F05) is possible too, though perhaps less relevant. Schizophreniform disorder (F20.9) or schizophrenia is unlikely. Brief psychotic disorder (F23) could fit, and we might include substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder (F19.951) despite no known substance use. The patient, post-surgery for a pituitary macroadenoma, continues to report visual hallucinations, so we need plausible diagnoses based on her specific situation.

**Examining hallucination causes**

The patient is experiencing anxiety and insomnia, feeling embarrassed by seeing unfamiliar faces that don't speak. Despite being aware that these hallucinations aren’t real, her neurologic exam is normal, which raises the possibility of Charles Bonnet syndrome. This syndrome typically involves complex visual hallucinations in people with visual impairment, especially with insight preserved. Given she had a macroadenoma compressing the optic chiasm, she likely had visual field defects. The hallucinations began preoperatively, supporting their physiological basis despite the lack of explicit mention of any visual impairment now.

**Determining primary and secondary diagnoses**

I’m considering that the primary diagnosis could be F06.0, which is a psychotic disorder with hallucinations due to a known physiological condition. There’s also the option of an ""Other specified psychotic disorder"" if she doesn’t fully meet that criteria. In terms of secondary diagnoses, she’s experiencing anxiety and insomnia because of her hallucinations; it might be appropriate to use F06.4 for ""Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition."" However, since her anxiety stems from the hallucinations, I’m also thinking about an adjustment disorder with anxiety (F43.22), but I need more information about her symptoms and timeframe.

**Creating a structured diagnosis list**

I need to be cautious about not assigning extra diagnoses without sufficient criteria. The user asked for a top five list of DSM-5-TR diagnoses, and I can include differential diagnoses even if they’re less likely. My primary diagnosis is F06.0—""psychotic disorder due to another medical condition, with hallucinations."" Secondary possibilities could be adjustment disorder with anxiety (F43.22), unspecified schizophrenia spectrum disorder (F29), brief psychotic disorder (F23), and potentially an anxiety disorder due to another medical condition (F06.4). These must be prioritized based on plausibility given the patient’s symptoms and context.

**Identifying potential diagnoses**

I’m considering the top diagnoses, focusing on the patient's symptoms given limited information. I can view anxiety and insomnia as symptoms rather than disorders, but I still need to list the top five diagnoses. One option is ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety."" I should also include plausible differentials for visual hallucinations like ""Delirium"" (F05) and ""Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.0) as primary. Other options could include ""Brief psychotic disorder"" (F23) and ""Schizophrenia"" (F20.9). I must ensure to prioritize each one thoughtfully.

**Structuring diagnoses list**

I need to prioritize the diagnoses given the context and symptoms. The top diagnosis will be ""Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.0), likely linked to hallucinations from the pituitary macroadenoma. Next, I'll include ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety"" (F43.22) due to the distress caused by the hallucinations post-surgery. Then, ""Nonorganic insomnia"" (F51.0) makes sense as a secondary issue. Following that, I’ll add ""Delirium"" (F05) as a less likely differential, and I might finish with ""Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum disorder"" (F29) for completeness. I need to ensure I adhere to the instruction to avoid clinical reasoning and only output structured diagnoses.

**Finalizing diagnosis options**

I need to pull together the most likely diagnoses. The top one looks to be ""Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.0), especially with the hallucinations in mind. Next, ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety"" (F43.22) feels suitable too because of the distress caused by the hallucinations. I can also consider ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" (F41.9) as a possible secondary. I'll also look at ""Delirium due to another medical condition"" (F05) and maybe ""Substance-induced psychotic disorder"" (F19.951), although we don’t have specifics.

**Finalizing the diagnosis list**

I can include ""Other specified mental disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.8) as a differential for Charles Bonnet syndrome. The primary diagnosis should be ""Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition with hallucinations"" (F06.0) because of the visual hallucinations linked to the pituitary macroadenoma. For the secondary diagnoses, I'm considering ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety"" (F43.22), ""Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.4), and also potentially ""Nonorganic insomnia"" (F51.0) to keep it aligned with the user's instructions for F-codes.

**Finalizing differential diagnoses**

The user needs the top five most likely diagnoses. I’ll focus on visual hallucinations and associated conditions. My primary diagnosis will be ""Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition, with hallucinations"" (F06.0). As for secondary diagnoses, I'll include ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety"" (F43.22), ""Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.4), and ""Delirium due to another medical condition"" (F05). This gives a solid variety without redundancy while ensuring all codes align with the requested format.

**Crafting final diagnoses**

I'm finalizing the list of the top five possible psychiatric diagnoses. My first choice is ""Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition, with hallucinations"" (F06.0). I plan to add ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety"" (F43.22) and ""Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.4). While I considered including ""Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder"" (F29), it might overlap too much. I'll also keep in mind possible differentials, focusing strictly on the information provided and the specific symptoms to guide my choices.

**Evaluating potential diagnoses**

I'm considering whether to include ""Unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder"" (F43.9) or ""Unspecified mental disorder"" (F99) in the final list. However, those feel too vague for top diagnoses. Insomnia could be treated as ""Insomnia disorder,"" but I can't assume a duration of three months since that isn't specified. I am thinking the hallucinations might have been ongoing even before surgery, but we need to stick to the provided information. So, I can't definitively diagnose insomnia, but I might look into ""Other specified insomnia disorder.""","1. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition, with hallucinations - F06.0

39,"A young man was referred by his Veterans Affairs (VA) primary care provider to the outpatient mental health clinic due to concerns for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. He served in the military for 4 years, including a 6-month tour in Iraq. While in Iraq he worked as an assault vehicle operator and was involved in frequent foot patrols. He reported numerous traumatic experiences, including frequent receipt of incoming fire, multiple ambushes, and an explosion by an improvised explosive device (IED) that injured several fellow soldiers.

He denied any psychiatric issues prior to his military service, but reported that since returning home “there ain’t a day that goes by that I don’t think about [these experiences].” The thoughts were highly distressing and he had frequent violent nightmares. He reported intense guilt relating to the belief that he should have detected the IED and been able to protect his colleagues. He reported a number of triggers (eg, walking down a city street; driving by a shooting range) that reminded him of his experiences in Iraq and induced panic-like symptoms (eg, fear, anxiety, racing heart, and feeling shaky). He avoided things that reminded him of these events and was reluctant to discuss his history.

He felt numb and withdrawn from others, reported difficulty sleeping, and was always “on guard.” He startled easily and had angry outbursts. The patient was hopeless at times, but denied suicidal thoughts. He reported difficulty concentrating and had significant fluctuations in his weight. He denied mania, psychosis, or medical problems. He reported drinking more than 12 beers 2 to 3 times per week. He denied any other substance abuse history.

The patient was briefly in outpatient treatment while he was still in the military. He was prescribed a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) but did not find it helpful and so he discontinued it. He was referred for psychotherapy but did not keep his appointments.

The patient grew up in the suburb of a small city. Though the patient initially described his childhood as “great,” later data revealed a history of early traumatic experiences.",Posttraumatic stress disorder requiring therapy,jama_psychiatry,"**Considering diagnostic codes**

I’m trying to understand the ICD-10 and DSM-5-TR codes. For example, ICD-10 might use F51.05 for ""Insomnia due to other mental disorder,"" while DSM-5-TR also uses similar codes for sleep-wake disorders. Insomnia disorder is coded as G47 in the ICD-10. I see that only some disorders have F codes, which can limit my options. I’m thinking I could include diagnosis like Nightmare disorder and perhaps ""Unspecified depressive disorder,"" and I’ll craft a top five list of potential diagnoses from here!

**Determining diagnoses**

I'm considering how to classify depressive disorders for a patient. I could use ""Other specified depressive disorder"" (F32.8) since we don't have full criteria. It's safer to capture significant symptoms without meeting all criteria. Alternatively, ""Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified"" might feel too strong, but I can still list it as a differential diagnosis. It’s crucial to provide a structured list of the top five likely diagnoses rather than just rule outs. Given the patient's symptoms like hopelessness and weight fluctuations, ""Other specified depressive disorder"" seems like the best fit.

**Exploring trauma-related diagnoses**

I'm trying to decide how to categorize some trauma-related symptoms, as they may be part of PTSD. The DSM includes ""nightmare disorder,"" but if nightmares only occur with PTSD, maybe we shouldn't assign it separately. I’m also considering panic disorder or ""Other specified anxiety disorder,"" given the panic symptoms triggered by reminders. However, these symptoms seem tied to PTSD too. I’m contemplating ""Specific phobia, situational type"" for triggers like being near certain places, but that feels more trauma-related. I’ll need to evaluate these options carefully!

**Evaluating potential diagnoses**

I’m considering several possible diagnoses, including ""Unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder"" (F43.9), but that may not fit since the patient has PTSD. ""Intermittent explosive disorder"" feels unlikely because the outbursts may stem from hyperarousal. I wonder about ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety,"" but that doesn't quite fit either. I’m also thinking about including ""Major depressive disorder"" and ""Alcohol use disorder,"" along with others like ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" for a total of five reasonable options. It’s a lot to sift through!

**Analyzing potential diagnoses**

I’m exploring several possible diagnoses for the patient’s symptoms. First, there’s the consideration of ""Panic disorder,"" but that feels less likely since symptoms might be linked to PTSD. ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder"" could capture some issues related to childhood trauma, but I have to be cautious about assumptions.

Now I’m trying to ensure I align the potential diagnoses with their respective ICD-10 codes while focusing on the primary one being PTSD. There’s also the need to confirm if ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" aligns with the criteria since we’re aiming for clarity in the diagnosis list!

**Determining possible diagnoses**

I’m considering the most likely diagnoses based on the user’s expectations and the evidence provided. Given the heavy drinking pattern of more than 12 beers a few times a week, this suggests potential alcohol use disorder (AUD), even if we can’t confirm impairment. We need a structured list, so I’m thinking it should include PTSD as the primary diagnosis, followed by major depressive disorder, AUD, panic disorder, and nightmare disorder. I’m also verifying the corresponding F-codes to ensure everything is accurate!

**Finalizing the diagnosis list**

The user needs a final list of diagnoses. Although the subject initially denied psychiatric issues before military service, later details suggest possible early trauma, hinting at underreporting. The core conditions include PTSD, depression, and alcohol use disorder. I’m thinking of including major depressive disorder and possibly panic disorder or another anxiety disorder. It's crucial to maintain a plausible set of diagnoses, while ensuring I use accurate F-codes. Here’s the final list with codes:   

1. Posttraumatic stress disorder - F43.10  
2. Alcohol use disorder - F10.10  
3. Major depressive disorder - F32.9  
4. Other specified anxiety disorder (panic attacks) - F41.8  
5. Nightmare disorder - F51.5

**Refining the diagnosis list**

In reviewing the potential diagnoses, I see that F32.9 corresponds to major depressive disorder, whereas F32.A is for unspecified depressive disorder. For alcohol use disorder, F10.10 is suitable as the mild code. I need to ensure exactly five diagnoses. Given the symptoms and instructions, I’ll list these:  

1. Posttraumatic stress disorder - F43.10  
2. Alcohol use disorder - F10.10  
3. Other specified depressive disorder - F32.8  
4. Other specified anxiety disorder - F41.8  
5. Nightmare disorder - F51.5  

This captures the core issues while using appropriate codes.

**Finalizing the diagnosis selection**

I’m considering the most appropriate diagnoses and codes. For the user’s case, I’ll list:

1. Posttraumatic stress disorder - F43.10  
2. Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified - F32.9  
3. Alcohol use disorder, moderate - F10.20  
4. Nightmare disorder - F51.5  
5. Other specified anxiety disorder (panic attacks) - F41.8  

While I think ""Nightmare disorder"" may feel repetitive, it still fits as a separate diagnosis. I want to ensure that these align with the expectations outlined.

**Formatting diagnoses correctly**

I need to format my final diagnoses list carefully. I'm considering:

1. PTSD - F43.10  
2. Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified - F32.9  
3. Alcohol use disorder, mild - F10.10  
4. Nightmare disorder - F51.5  
5. Other specified anxiety disorder (panic attacks) - F41.8  

I want to avoid any additional text or speculation. ""Nightmare disorder"" may be redundant if it's part of PTSD, but I’ve chosen to list it. I'll ensure these fit the expected structure perfectly!

**Choosing likely diagnoses**

I need to come up with a list of the top five most likely diagnoses. For sure, there’s PTSD, likely followed by alcohol use disorder and major depressive disorder. Generalized anxiety disorder might not be accurately represented here, while intermittent explosive disorder could be considered, but isn't well-supported. 

I’ll finalize this structured list including:

1. PTSD - F43.10  
2. Alcohol use disorder - F10.20  
3. Major depressive disorder - F32.9  
4. Panic disorder - F41.0  
5. Generalized anxiety disorder - F41.1  

This keeps it focused on supported conditions without unnecessary speculation!

**Finalizing diagnoses list**

I’m trying to come up with a solid list of the top five diagnoses. I’m definitely including PTSD - F43.10 and Alcohol use disorder - F10.20. Major depressive disorder - F32.9 is next, along with Panic disorder - F41.0, and I'll add Generalized anxiety disorder - F41.1. 

While there’s some debate about whether to include both panic and generalized anxiety, I think it’s still valuable to cover them both for a well-rounded diagnostic view. This meets the requirement for the structured list!

**Deciding on diagnoses**

I'm finalizing the top five diagnoses and I'm considering several options. I have PTSD - F43.10, Major depressive disorder - F32.9, and Alcohol use disorder - F10.20. For the fourth spot, I’m thinking of Panic disorder - F41.0, and for a fifth, maybe Generalized anxiety disorder - F41.1 or Unspecified anxiety disorder - F41.9, but those might overlap with panic symptoms. 

I ultimately want to ensure the list is plausible and reflects the best support from symptoms described.

**Finalizing diagnostic list**

I’m considering the best diagnoses, specifically for PTSD, Major depressive disorder, and Alcohol use disorder as my top three. For the fourth and fifth positions, I might use Panic disorder or Generalized anxiety disorder, but I need to think about how likely they actually are. 

While I could also consider including Insomnia disorder or Nightmare disorder, it seems best to focus on the most relevant psychiatric conditions supported by symptoms, so I aim to keep it clear and concise.

**Creating diagnostic list**

I'm examining the case given the emphasis on early trauma, and it might contribute to current conditions. Based on that, I'll include the most plausible diagnoses, likely focusing on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Alcohol Use Disorder, Other Specified Anxiety Disorder, and possibly Nightmare Disorder.

40,"A 20-year-old woman was referred by her family physician to a community mental health team in London, United Kingdom. Her mental state had deteriorated progressively over the previous 12 months, following the death of her father. After a period living alone, she had returned to the family home 4 months prior to her presentation and had been noted to be socially withdrawn, preoccupied, and distractible. Her family physician, suspecting a depressive episode, had prescribed citalopram up to a dosage of 40 mg once daily, to no effect. Her family subsequently sought advice from the family physician when the patient was noted to be speaking to herself, expressing concerns about people meaning her harm, and professing the belief that she could hear other peoples’ thoughts.

The patient had been born in Sierra Leone after a complicated delivery and had traveled to the United Kingdom as a child with her family, who were fleeing from a civil war. On arrival in the United Kingdom, her family claimed asylum and moved into a small apartment in a high-rise building in central London. Although there was no reported developmental delay, she had struggled academically at school and was bullied for having overweight. She left school without qualifications at age 16 years and worked as a shop assistant. She left this job about a year prior to her referral to psychiatry after a period of sick leave following the death of her father. She was a nonsmoker, did not drink alcohol, and denied illicit drug use. A paternal relative was reported to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia. There was no comorbid physical illness.

On review, the patient was kempt and had overweight. Eye contact was fleeting, and she presented as anxious, with a degree of psychomotor agitation. Her speech was normal in rate, volume, and tone, although tangential. There was no other evidence of thought disorder. She denied feeling low in mood or suicidal and was objectively euthymic. There was some sleep disturbance, with the patient reporting being fearful to go to sleep owing to persecutory beliefs regarding her neighbors. She reflected that over the preceding few months, she had experienced a sensation of detachment from her immediate environment, as though it was not real, making her world similar to that of a video game. She reported that in the apartment where she had previously been living, she had realized that something was amiss and had become convinced that the door number of her neighbor’s flat, number 6, signified that they meant her harm. She explained this was because 6 was associated with the number of the devil. She reported hearing her neighbors commenting negatively about her appearance. These distressing experiences prompted her to return to her family home, but she continued to hear her neighbors’ voices making derogatory comments about her appearance and began to hear them commenting on her actions and thoughts in the third person as well. On returning home, her paranoia regarding her previous neighbors worsened, resulting in her rarely leaving the house. The volume and frequency of derogatory auditory hallucinations also worsened, and she reported hearing the thoughts of others as well. There was a degree of insight, and although the patient was convinced of the reality of her experiences, she also saw the stress of losing her father as associated with her experiences and was accepting of input from mental health services.",Schizophrenia,jama_psychiatry,"**Identifying potential diagnoses**

I’m tasked with giving the top five most likely diagnoses along with their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes. The primary diagnosis could be schizophrenia, while the secondary diagnoses might include other psychotic disorders and mood disorders with psychotic features. 

I'll carefully examine the vignette concerning a 20-year-old woman with progressive deterioration in her mental state after her father's death. She experiences social withdrawal and distractibility and has been prescribed citalopram for suspected depression without improvement. Let's consider the details of her background as we assess potential diagnoses.

**Analyzing symptoms and history**

I'm examining a case with no developmental delays, but the individual struggled academically and faced bullying due to being overweight. They left school at 16 and worked as a shop assistant until quitting after a period of sick leave following their father's death. The individual has no history of substance use and a paternal relative with schizophrenia. 

Upon review, they appear anxious with fleeting eye contact, experience sleep disturbances due to fears related to neighbors, and report derealization and delusions surrounding perceived threats.

**Evaluating worsening symptoms**

Distressing experiences led her to return to her family home, where she continued to hear derogatory comments about her appearance and actions from her neighbors. This increasing paranoia made her reluctant to leave the house. The frequency and volume of hallucinations worsened, with her also reporting thought broadcasting, where she believed others could hear her thoughts. 

Despite some insight into her condition, she exhibits auditory hallucinations, persecutory delusions, and disorganized speech, leading to social withdrawal and functional decline over the past 12 months.

**Assessing symptom timeline**

Active psychosis may have lasted only a few months, but her psychotic symptoms likely started earlier, possibly going unrecognized. She displayed social withdrawal and preoccupation for 12 months, suggesting a prodromal phase. 

Her active symptoms might have begun when she moved back to her family home four months prior to the presentation. At that time, she was already showing signs of being distractible and withdrawn, leading the family physician to prescribe citalopram for suspected depression. A history of feeling something was wrong in her previous apartment could indicate earlier symptoms.

**Determining likely diagnoses and codes**

It seems she may have lived alone after leaving her job, hinting that her psychotic symptoms likely began during that time, prior to moving back home four months ago. This aligns with her reports of detachment.

To diagnose schizophrenia, continuous disturbance for six months, including prodromal symptoms, is needed. Given her deterioration over 12 months, conditions like schizophreniform disorder or schizoaffective disorder are possible differentials. The codes for top possible diagnoses include schizophrenia (F20.9), schizophreniform disorder (F20.81), schizoaffective disorder (F25.1), major depressive disorder with psychotic features (F32.3), and delusional disorder (F22).

**Listing potential diagnoses**

In the ICD-10-CM framework, I can consider ""Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.2) or ""Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder"" (F19.959), but since she denies substance use, these might be less likely. I should focus on establishing a structured list of top diagnoses based on the provided information, emphasizing her potential primary schizophrenia diagnosis (F20.9) and secondary diagnoses such as schizophreniform disorder (F20.81), schizoaffective disorder (F25.1), major depressive disorder with psychotic features (F32.3), and delusional disorder (F22).

**Assigning possible diagnoses**

I'm focusing on identifying the potential diagnoses for the user’s case, particularly as she left her job after her father's death and may have had depressive symptoms. I need to prioritize primary diagnoses like schizophrenia (F20.9) and maybe consider others like schizophreniform disorder (F20.81) and schizoaffective disorder (F25.1). Major depressive disorder with psychotic features (F32.3) could be relevant too. I need to ensure the top five diagnoses reflect this and include appropriate F-codes while avoiding any implausible diagnoses.

**Selecting potential diagnoses**

I'm evaluating the possible diagnoses based on the user's symptoms, considering options like ""Attenuated psychosis syndrome"" and ""Depersonalization/derealization disorder"" (F48.1) as a comorbidity. However, due to the presence of schizophrenia, I’m concerned about the validity of a separate diagnosis for derealization. I also ponder the inclusion of unspecified anxiety disorder (F41.9). The top five diagnoses I'm leaning toward would be schizophrenia (F20.9), followed by schizophreniform (F20.81), schizoaffective (F25.1), major depressive disorder with psychotic features (F32.3), and potentially substance-induced psychotic disorder.

**Evaluating potential diagnoses**

I'm weighing the diagnosis options based on the user's symptoms, like considering ""Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder,"" but there's uncertainty since no substance use is confirmed. I reflect on listing ""Psychotic disorder, unspecified"" (F29) but question its validity compared to other specific diagnoses. The top five likely candidates I narrow down are schizophrenia (F20.9), schizophreniform disorder (F20.81), schizoaffective disorder (F25.1), major depressive disorder with psychotic features (F32.3), and possibly depersonalization/derealization disorder (F48.1) as a comorbid condition.

43,"A 29-year old man who is married and an employed Army veteran presented with headache from a mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) diagnosed before his Army discharge. He came to a Veterans Affairs hospital requesting buprenorphine/naloxone and complained of marital problems and job absenteeism. His TBI occurred when a roadside bomb overturned his supply truck in Afghanistan. He lost consciousness during the bombing and awoke with severe head and neck pain but no radiological brain, spine, or skull damage or focal neurological signs. He was given 20 oral morphine (5 mg) tablets and consumed them in 4 days rather than the intended 2 weeks. After finishing the morphine, he mitigated his pain with alcohol and ibuprofen (400-800 mg daily).

His opioid and ibuprofen use for TBI headaches escalated during and after his time in the military despite repeated efforts to stop by using clonidine, which relieved his withdrawal symptoms, although a rapid clonidine with naltrexone detoxification failed. After consuming a 6-week supply of morphine (5 mg) from his family physician in 3 weeks, he started receiving morphine from multiple pain physicians for about a year and buying prescription opioids from a friend. When the prescription opioids became too expensive, he started using heroin intravenously. After using heroin for about a year, he survived a respiratory arrest from overdosing with heroin mixed with fentanyl. This almost fatal overdose and persistent headaches scared him into going to a Veterans Affairs hospital, wanting buprenorphine/naloxone. His headaches had gotten worse since his injury 3 years ago, but new radiologic and neurologic examinations showed no abnormalities.",Opioid use disorder and mild TBI,jama_psychiatry,"**Considering diagnoses for opioid use**

I’m thinking about including ""Opioid-induced depressive disorder,"" but it’s not described in detail. The question expects five diagnoses, so I should start with ""Opioid Use Disorder, severe"" as the primary. I’m contemplating secondary options like ""Opioid intoxication"" or ""Opioid withdrawal,"" but I’m not sure if he’s currently in withdrawal since he’s seeking treatment. It might be worth noting ""Opioid Use Disorder, severe, with physiological dependence,"" but the DSM doesn't use that term. I'll work through these carefully!

**Determining additional diagnoses**

I need to find four more plausible diagnoses for this case. I’m considering ""Alcohol Use Disorder, mild (provisional),"" but I mustn't fabricate anything. Since the user asks for a structured list of DSM-5-TR diagnoses, I have to ensure they’re based on the data. I might include ""Other (or unknown) substance use disorder"" as well. Reviewing the details, he experienced headaches from a mild TBI, escalated opioid and ibuprofen use, and even switched to IV heroin after overdose. This all points to severe opioid use disorder, and while there's mention of alcohol use, I can't determine if it's a disorder without more data.

**Clarifying possible diagnoses**

I’m considering ""Alcohol Use Disorder,"" but there aren't enough criteria to confirm it, so I can list it as a secondary differential. The rubric requires level 5 reasoning, but the final answer should just be a list. I could consider ""Posttraumatic Stress Disorder"" due to combat exposure, but since there are no symptoms provided, I can only include it as a rule-out. However, they want actual diagnoses, so I need to focus on those. I also think about ""Somatic symptom disorder with predominant pain,"" since he has persistent headaches related to his TBI.

**Identifying potential diagnoses**

Considering ""Somatic symptom disorder,"" it needs excessive thoughts and behaviors that aren’t described here, so that's a no. I could think about ""Adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct"" due to marital and job stress, but mood symptoms aren’t detailed. As for ""Cannabis use disorder"" or ""Unspecified depressive disorder,"" I don't see support for those either. We could include ""Opioid-induced anxiety disorder,"" but it doesn't feel solid. ""Opioid Use Disorder, severe"" is definitely relevant, along with possible withdrawal symptoms he managed with clonidine. I might also add ""Alcohol Use Disorder, mild.""

**Finalizing potential diagnoses**

I’m trying to determine if the user has current opioid withdrawal, but that isn’t detailed. While we could diagnose ""Opioid Withdrawal,"" there’s a focus on presenting DSM-5-TR diagnoses, with ""Opioid Use Disorder, severe"" being the most significant. Additional thoughts include possibly adding ""Alcohol Use Disorder"" due to his alcohol use for pain relief. I’m also considering including ""Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions"" (F54), as his substance use could be impacting his headaches. However, confirming the precise diagnoses based on the available information is challenging. I must ensure I stick to the instructions of listing the top five diagnoses.

**Identifying potential diagnoses**

I need to create a structured list of prominent DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses while aligning with the provided vignette. The clear top contender is ""Opioid Use Disorder, severe (F11.20)."" For secondary options, I’m considering ""Alcohol Use Disorder, mild (F10.10)"" along with ""Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions (F54)."" PTSD might fit due to trauma, but symptoms aren't present. However, it's plausible to include as a risk factor. I also want to think carefully through the criteria and ensure I adhere strictly to the instructions provided.

**Clarifying potential diagnoses**

I need to pinpoint the best DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses while ensuring they align with the provided vignette. The clear standout is ""Opioid Use Disorder, severe (F11.20)."" For other options, I should consider historical aspects like ""Opioid Withdrawal (F11.23)"" since there is a past history of withdrawal symptoms. I might also include ""Opioid Intoxication (F11.129)"" due to his past overdose events. Additionally, ""Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions (F54)"" could be relevant given his persistent headaches. The goal is to include plausible, evidence-supported diagnoses without making assumptions.

**Creating a structured diagnosis list**

I’m thinking about how to capture the relevant diagnoses based on the provided details. The clear diagnosis is ""Opioid Use Disorder, severe (F11.20)."" Next, I could include ""Opioid Withdrawal (F11.23)"" since there's a history of withdrawal symptoms. ""Opioid Intoxication (F11.129)"" would also fit due to the past overdose. For his alcohol use, I might note ""Alcohol Use Disorder, mild (F10.10)"" and finish with ""Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions (F54),"" considering how his substance use impacts his headaches. Each choice reflects the available evidence!

**Assessing neurocognitive disorders**

I'm considering how to categorize the neurocognitive disorders based on provided details. While mild neurocognitive disorder uses a G code, there's also a ""Neurocognitive disorder due to TBI"" that might fall under F07.81, which actually represents postconcussional syndrome. This syndrome includes cognitive deficits and symptoms like headaches. Since I need to ensure accuracy, I can suggest:

1. Opioid Use Disorder, severe (F11.20)
2. Alcohol Use Disorder, mild (F10.10)
3. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (F43.10)
4. Psychological factors affecting other medical condition (F54)
5. Other specified neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury (F07.81). 

This list reflects supported diagnoses!

**Considering potential diagnoses**

I'm evaluating whether the individual might have ""Somatic Symptom Disorder"" due to persistent headaches and high healthcare use, though it's unclear if this stems from pain or possible addiction. I also contemplate ""Factitious Disorder"" or malingering, but lack evidence of intentional feigning. 

I think we can list:

1. Opioid Use Disorder, severe (F11.20)
2. Opioid Withdrawal (F11.23)
3. Opioid Intoxication (F11.129)
4. Alcohol Use Disorder, mild (F10.10)
5. Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions (F54)

This keeps the focus on supported diagnoses based on the information available.

**Identifying potential diagnoses**

I’m considering various diagnoses, like ""Somatic Symptom Disorder"" due to persistent headaches and anyone's behavioral impact on health. He visits multiple physicians, which could indicate excessive concern about his condition. 

But I think it’s also critical to focus on substance use disorders:

1. Opioid Use Disorder, severe (primary)
2. Opioid Withdrawal (F11.23)
3. Opioid Intoxication (F11.129)
4. Somatic Symptom Disorder, persistent (F45.1)
5. Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions (F54)

I’m cautious not to include unsupported diagnoses, like PTSD, due to insufficient symptom evidence.

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

I’m considering the top diagnoses here, focusing on what's supported by the information I have. Here are my top five:

1. Opioid Use Disorder, severe (F11.20)  
2. Opioid Withdrawal (F11.23)  
3. Opioid Intoxication (F11.129)  
4. Somatic Symptom Disorder, with predominant pain (F45.1)  
5. Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions (F54)  

I've made sure to follow the guidelines closely, ensuring all entries are relevant and based on available data without extrapolating unsupported information.

44,"A 4-year-old boy was referred to the child psychiatry clinic for management of tantrums with aggression and self-injurious behavior. Tantrums were unpredictable and often resulted in severe head-butting. His parents also reported atypical social and language development, disrupted sleep, and persistent impulsivity with attempts to elope.

The patient had a complex medical history that was marked by prematurity at 32 weeks, slow postnatal growth, and severe gastroesophageal reflux. Genetic testing following an episode of hypoglycemia revealed microdeletion of the 16p11.2 region of chromosome 16. His pediatrician documented a normal neurological examination without dysmorphology or congenital anomalies.

A developmental evaluation revealed delays in motor function and language development notable by age 2 years. He attended a 0 to 3 program with intensive speech therapy and then moved to a self-contained preschool classroom with a 1:1 staff-to-student ratio. He received school-based speech, occupational, and physical therapies. Testing results revealed clinically significant scores on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. Cognitive testing results showed that his IQ was below average but was likely an underestimate due to noncompliance. The parents stated that he played repetitively, lining up toy cars and spinning their wheels. He did not seek or give comfort to others when distressed. He had tactile hypersensitivity but pain hyposensitivity, flicked light switches repetitively, and mouthed objects.

In the office, the patient showed a minimal response to clinicians’ social overtures and poor eye contact. He replayed videos on a smartphone while laughing, spinning around, and flapping his hands. He did not respond to prompts for joint engagement and no imaginative play was observed. When the videos stopped, he repeatedly climbed onto chairs and jumped off. As clinicians attempted to redirect him, he became very agitated and his mother intervened physically to protect him from self-injury.","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (associated with chromosome 16p11.2 deletion syndrome, level 3 severity, with accompanying intellectual and language impairment) and global developmental delay",jama_psychiatry,"**Evaluating SMD diagnosis**

I'm considering how Stereotypic Movement Disorder (SMD) can be diagnosed alongside other neurodevelopmental disorders. Criterion E creates some confusion by stating that symptoms shouldn't be better explained by another disorder. However, it seems SMD can coexist with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) if the stereotypies are distinct and severe. 

The DSM-5 does allow for SMD diagnosis even when associated with ASD, which is an important update compared to DSM-IV that had stricter criteria. I'll need to verify these criteria for clarity.

**Analyzing SMD criteria**

I'm looking at how Stereotypic Movement Disorder (SMD) interacts with conditions like Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The suggestion that there's an exclusion is interesting, especially since SMD can relate to known medical or genetic conditions. For example, a child with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome might show stereotypies that we could specify as associated with that condition. 

But if SMD is linked to ASD, does that mean it can't be diagnosed separately? The specifiers may refer more to intellectual disabilities, as SMD often overlaps there. The situation is complex, especially when considering self-injury.

**Selecting appropriate diagnoses**

I'm trying to be careful with diagnosis possibilities, especially since I can't just make things up. One option could be ""Other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder,"" but that might get complicated. I'm considering other conditions like ""Autism Spectrum Disorder,"" ""Global Developmental Delay,"" ""ADHD (predominantly hyperactive/impulsive presentation),"" and ""Unspecified sleep-wake disorder."" 

However, we need to narrow it down to the top five likely diagnoses. Also, I should look at conditions like the 16p11.2 microdeletion and how it relates to ASD and other difficulties, but I'm not sure how to categorize that under DSM-5.

**Clarifying diagnostic specifications**

I’m realizing that the DSM-5 has introduced a specifier for ""associated with a known medical or genetic condition"" for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Intellectual Disabilities (ID). ADHD doesn’t have a similar specifier, but there is a diagnosis for ""Neurodevelopmental disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure."" 

I think we can include the specifier for the 16p11.2 microdeletion under ASD to provide nuance, even though it’s not necessary. I also need to ensure that I use the correct ICD-10 codes for each diagnosis, which should include Autism (F84.0), ADHD (F90.1), and others. Now, I have to decide on the fifth diagnosis to include.

**Determining top diagnoses**

I'm trying to identify the most likely diagnoses based on the symptoms presented, such as tantrums, aggression, self-injury, and developmental deficits. I think ASD should be primary, followed by ADHD and Global Developmental Delay (GDD). For the fifth diagnosis, I’m debating between a language disorder and unspecified disruptive, impulse-control disorder. 

Including the language disorder seems valid due to documented delays. I want to ensure we list appropriate diagnoses with the correct ICD-10 codes, focusing on plausible options without uncertainty. So, based on the symptoms, I'm favoring a structured list like:

1. Autism Spectrum Disorder (F84.0)
2. Global Developmental Delay (F88)
3. ADHD (predominantly hyperactive/impulsive; F90.1)
4. Sleep-Wake Disorder, unspecified (F51.9)
5. Language Disorder (or Unspecified Communication Disorder, if we need to adjust).

**Finalizing potential diagnoses**

I’m considering the prevalent issues of language delays, social engagement difficulties, and behavioral symptoms. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) seems primary, along with Global Developmental Delay (GDD), and ADHD for guidance. Language Disorder could be noted due to significant delays. I should confirm corresponding ICD-10 codes for these:

1. Autism Spectrum Disorder - F84.0
2. Global Developmental Delay - F88
3. ADHD (predominantly hyperactive/impulsive) - F90.1
4. Sleep-Wake Disorder, unspecified - F51.9 
5. Language Disorder - F80.2

These all represent plausible diagnoses based on the provided descriptions, capturing critical aspects of the situation.

**Structuring final diagnoses**

I’m identifying key diagnoses based on the situation. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) appears crucial, and Global Developmental Delay (GDD) is likely present as well. The child has language delays, so including a Language Disorder is possible, but it may overlap with ASD specs. ADHD is also significant for consideration. For sleep issues, I can classify them as an unspecified sleep-wake disorder. Finally, including “Other specified disruptive impulse-control, and conduct disorder” seems necessary for addressing severe tantrums. 

Here’s my structured list:

1. Autism Spectrum Disorder, associated with known genetic condition (16p11.2 microdeletion), with accompanying language impairment - F84.0  
2. Global Developmental Delay - F88  
3. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, predominantly hyperactive/impulsive presentation - F90.1  
4. Sleep-Wake Disorder, unspecified - F51.9  
5. Other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder (severe recurrent temper outbursts/aggression) - F91.8

48,"A previously healthy 61-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 4-week history of severe weakness and difficulty ambulating independently. He had difficulty rising from a seated position. Additional symptoms included progressive numbness and tingling of the hands and feet.

An extensive review of systems was otherwise unremarkable, except for a few months of intermittent nausea, increased abdominal bloating, and anorexia.

Results of renal function and liver function tests were normal. Because of the asymmetric hyperreflexia and concern for a spinal cord lesion, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine was performed.",Vitamin B12 deficiency.,jama,"**Evaluating psychiatric diagnoses**

I need to provide the top 5 likely DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses with their ICD-10 F codes based on a vignette. The case seems primarily neurologic due to symptoms like weakness, neuropathy, and memory impairment, possibly indicating B12 deficiency. There might be a mild neurocognitive disorder, but the DSM requirements need clear cognitive decline proof. Family reports memory issues over four weeks, but I can't see signs of delirium. Several possibilities are emerging, including neurocognitive disorder due to the medical condition or depressive disorder.

**Clarifying diagnostic codes**

The case mentions an MRI due to hyperreflexia and systemic symptoms like nausea and bloating, possibly indicating pernicious anemia and B12 deficiency that could lead to a neurocognitive disorder. I was considering labeling it ""Mild neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition,"" but I realized that it needs to be coded correctly using F codes. The DSM-5-TR allows using F codes, so I have to focus on providing only those diagnoses without mixing in other codes.

**Exploring neurocognitive disorder codes**

It seems that neurocognitive disorders can have F codes, like delirium due to a medical condition (F05) or major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's (F02.80). For mild neurocognitive disorders, G31.84 is the ICD-10-CM code, which isn't an F code. However, F06.7 represents mild cognitive disorder due to a known condition, and that's an F code. Additionally, I think DSM-5-TR might map mild neurocognitive disorders to F06.7, even though this gets a bit confusing with the various codes in DSM-5 and ICD-9/10.

**Assessing neurocognitive disorder options**

For mild neurocognitive disorder (NCD) related to Alzheimer's, I found that the ICD-9 code is 331.83 while the ICD-10 code is G31.84. However, since the user specifically requests F-codes, I might consider ""Mild cognitive disorder"" (F06.7) as it’s F-coded and slightly aligns with mild NCD. There's also the possibility of diagnosing ""Delirium due to another medical condition"" (F05), but I notice that the criteria for delirium regarding attention disturbance aren't met here. So I wonder if “Major neurocognitive disorder” (F02.80) or even ""Unspecified neurocognitive disorder"" (F09) might be applicable, but there isn't enough evidence yet to confirm that.

**Determining psychiatric diagnoses**

F09 is for ""Unspecified mental disorder due to another medical condition,"" which might fit cognitive impairment without meeting full criteria, but isn’t ideal. I could consider ""Mild cognitive disorder"" (F06.7) instead, as it’s F-coded and aligns somewhat with mild neurocognitive disorders. We need to list the top 5 psychiatric diagnoses primarily addressing macrocytic anemia and neuro deficits. I’ll suggest ""Mild neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.7), ""Delirium due to another medical condition"" (F05), and other possibilities such as ""Major neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition"" (F02.80), despite the challenges in fitting them perfectly.

**Listing potential psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm thinking about the DSM diagnoses, where many have F codes, but some don’t. For neurocognitive disorders, major ones use F codes, while mild ones use G31.84, which complicates things. The user wants F codes only, so I can propose ""Mild neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.7) as a fitting diagnosis. I’ll also include others like ""Delirium due to another medical condition"" (F05) and ""Major neurocognitive disorder due to another condition"" (F02.80). I'll need to make sure these choices align with the user's guidelines, focusing primarily on the neurocognitive cluster.

**Clarifying neurocognitive diagnoses**

I’m sorting through DSM-5-TR terminology. It appears we should mention ""Delirium due to another medical condition"" and ""Major neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition."" However, ""Mild cognitive disorder"" isn't an official diagnosis in DSM, but ""Mild neurocognitive disorder"" exists with code 331.83 (G31.84). 

I’m considering how to categorize the diagnoses correctly, ensuring they align with DSM-5 standards, while focusing on five plausible F-coded diagnoses like ""Mild neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.7) among others.

**Identifying neurocognitive disorders**

I'm going through potential diagnoses, focusing on ""Unspecified neurocognitive disorder,"" which might correspond to F03.90. This could be relevant for major cases but not mild ones. 

To solidify my findings, I'll consider five key diagnoses, including ""Mild neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.7) and ""Delirium due to another medical condition"" (F05). I'll ensure they align with the DSM-5-TR guidelines and rank them appropriately.  I’m also mindful not to fabricate details while providing necessary medical context.

**Clarifying neurocognitive diagnoses**

I'm considering various disorders and suspecting that ""Mild neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition"" is a viable diagnosis with code F06.7. I’m outlining key diagnoses, including ""Delirium due to another medical condition"" (F05) and ""Major neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition"" (F02.80). I’m also weighing whether to include unspecified disorders while ensuring they remain plausible. This leads me to finalize the top five diagnoses, prioritizing accuracy and relevance while sticking to psychiatric codes.

**Confirming neurocognitive disorder codes**

I’m sorting out several diagnosis codes and their descriptions. R41.9 is for unspecified cognitive symptoms, while F03.90 maps to unspecified dementia. Major neurocognitive disorders have specific codes like F02.80 and multiple etiologies. Given the patient’s symptoms of memory decline over four weeks, multiple diagnoses could fit, like mild NCD or delirium from a medical condition. I'm crafting a list of five primary diagnoses, ensuring I follow DSM-5 terminology and using the correct ICD-10 codes.

**Delivering final diagnoses**

I’m making sure to avoid any specifiers that imply behavioral disturbance. According to ICD-10-CM, I see that F02.80 is for ""Dementia in other diseases classified elsewhere without behavioral disturbance,"" while F01.50 covers ""Vascular dementia without behavioral disturbance,"" and F03.90 is ""Unspecified dementia without behavioral disturbance.""

50,"Ms T is a 60-year-old woman whose husband was diagnosed with stage IV esophageal cancer and who died 9 months later. Although Ms T lost her mother as a teenager and her father and close friend more recently, nothing had prepared her for the loss of her husband. Ms T and her husband were inseparable through 28 years of marriage. They did not have children.

Ms T was emotionally paralyzed following the death of her husband. She began seeing a psychiatrist who recommended taking citalopram, 20 mg daily, and joining a survivor’s support group. Although initially Ms T accepted these suggestions reluctantly, she ultimately concluded that they were helpful.

Ms T has no prior history of depression and denies any suicidal or homicidal ideation. On the 19-item Inventory of Complicated Grief assessment,1 Ms T scored 48. A score of more than 30 is considered a cut point for identifying complicated grief for intervention. Ms T reported that she thinks about her deceased husband so much that it’s hard for her to resume her daily life. She feels herself longing for her deceased husband, and she has had a feeling of being lost since her husband died.",Complicated grief.,jama,"**Interpreting grief diagnosis timeline**

I'm noticing that the timeline of the diagnosis isn't clear, so I can't pinpoint when the person died. In many cases, the husband is typically diagnosed and then passes away about nine months later, and now she’s here for evaluation; possibly it's shortly after the death. However, complicated grief suggests it’s been a while. Given the high scores, I need to interpret this ambiguity and identify the top five diagnoses. I may consider Prolonged Grief Disorder as primary, but I'm uncertain about the safety of that assumption.

**Evaluating grief diagnoses**

I'm realizing that while I can treat some options as ""provisional"" or ""rule out,"" the task requires a structured list of diagnoses. Given that the timeline isn’t specified, I can choose ""Other specified trauma-and stressor-related disorder"" as primary since it captures complicated grief symptoms. I could label it as ""Other specified trauma-and stressor-related disorder (prolonged grief reaction)."" Additionally, I might consider Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood or anxiety, but her symptoms seem more grief-specific. I must remember not to include unsupported options.

**Identifying likely diagnoses**

I’m trying to come up with the top five most likely diagnoses, keeping them plausible. I think I can include ""Other specified trauma-and stressor-related disorder"" as a primary option, coded F43.8. I’m also considering Prolonged Grief Disorder, but I need to clarify its ICD-10 code. I believe it’s mentioned as F43.81 in the DSM-5-TR, but I'm confused about the adjustment disorder codes. I need to check that again to ensure accuracy before finalizing my list.

**Clarifying grief disorder codes**

It seems that in the DSM-5, code 309.0 corresponds to adjustment disorders, specifically ""Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood."" I believe ""Prolonged Grief Disorder"" was recently added and could share the code F43.81. To verify, I need to ensure the ICD-10 F codes are accurate. I remember that F43.81 is indeed ""Prolonged Grief Disorder."" I also see F43.8 as ""Other specified trauma-and stressor-related disorder,"" which is useful. As I finalize these, I’ll keep F43.81 as a plausible choice for my top diagnoses.

**Establishing secondary diagnoses**

I can’t confirm the exact time since the death, but the vignette suggests complicated grief, possibly over 12 months. The information shows the individual is emotionally paralyzed and engaged in treatment with citalopram and support groups. I think it makes sense to consider ""Prolonged Grief Disorder"" as the primary diagnosis, given the symptoms match well. For secondary diagnoses, I could suggest ""Major Depressive Disorder,"" ""Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood,"" and ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder."" It's crucial to ensure these are plausible options without fabricating details, based only on the symptoms presented.

**Identifying primary and secondary diagnoses**

The code for Prolonged Grief Disorder is likely F43.81, and I think it fits the symptoms, including longing and difficulty reintegrating. However, I also need to consider whether ""Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood"" might fit too. But, grief-specific symptoms lean towards prolonged grief. For the four secondary diagnoses, I could suggest: ""Major Depressive Disorder"" (F32.9), ""Adjustment Disorder"" (F43.21), and ""Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder"" (F43.8). Since the vignette doesn't specify time since death, that complicates things a bit for prolonged grief.

**Determining appropriate diagnoses**

I'm weighing the DSM-5-TR requirements, particularly for Prolonged Grief Disorder, which needs 12 months after loss. I wonder if the scenario may reference earlier concepts like complicated grief, which could apply after six months. The Inventory of Complicated Grief supports this. It's tricky since the vignette lacks clear timeframes. I think Prolonged Grief Disorder should be the primary diagnosis, but I might need to list ""Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder"" as part of the differential. In the end, it has to be structured as a diagnosis list, not reasoning.

**Clarifying diagnoses and timelines**

I'm mulling over the coding for depression in ICD-10-CM and DSM-5-TR. F32.A is ""Depression, unspecified,"" but it could cause confusion with other depressive disorders. I should use F32.9 to be safe. For secondary diagnoses, I’m considering Major Depressive Disorder, Adjustment Disorder, PTSD, and Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder. The vignette's timeline is puzzling; it mentions the husband's diagnosis and death without clear time frames. I’ll have to choose a primary diagnosis based on what fits best given this ambiguity.

**Determining diagnostic codes**

I'm exploring the application of diagnostic flexibility for complex cases. The user wants ""DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses,"" and since this case revolves around complicated grief, I think ""Prolonged Grief Disorder"" should be the primary diagnosis. For secondary diagnoses, I'm considering Major Depressive Disorder, Adjustment Disorder, PTSD, and ""Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder."" I need to ensure the codes are correct, as follows: Prolonged grief - F43.81, Major depressive disorder - F32.9, Adjustment disorder - F43.21, PTSD - F43.10, and Other specified disorder - F43.8.

**Finalizing differential diagnoses**

I'm detailing the top five psychiatric diagnoses related to complicated grief. For primary, I’m choosing ""Prolonged Grief Disorder"" (F43.81). The secondary options include ""Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder"" (F43.8), ""Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Unspecified"" (F32.9), ""Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood"" (F43.21), and ""Posttraumatic Stress Disorder"" (F43.10). This selection reflects plausible alternatives based on the vignette, ensuring a comprehensive approach to identifying the patient's condition while staying true to the diagnostic criteria.

**Structuring differential diagnoses**

I'm finalizing a structured list of psychiatric diagnoses based on the vignette. For the primary diagnosis, I'm identifying ""Prolonged Grief Disorder"" with ICD-10 code F43.81. The secondary diagnoses include ""Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood"" (F43.21), ""Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Unspecified"" (F32.9), ""Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder"" (F43.8), and possibly ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder"" (F41.1). However, depending on interpretation, I might list ""Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder"" first to ensure broad coverage if time criterion uncertainty exists.

**Choosing the right diagnoses**

For the primary diagnosis, I should select ""Prolonged Grief Disorder"" (F43.81) since it aligns well with the provided details. However, without clear confirmation of the 12-month criterion, it's safer to consider other specified trauma/stressor disorder as a secondary option. While symptoms indicated grief-related issues, I need to avoid assumptions due to missing information. Ultimately, I plan to list my top five diagnoses, prioritizing them according to likelihood, keeping in mind the context from the vignette.

**Finalizing diagnoses list**

I’m working on the most suitable diagnoses, and for the primary one, ""Prolonged Grief Disorder"" feels right. For the second, I could go with ""Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood"" since it's an option when grief doesn’t fully meet the criteria for prolonged grief. ""Major Depressive Disorder,"" ""Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder,” and ""Posttraumatic Stress Disorder"" follow in the rankings. Ultimately, I'll ensure everything is formatted correctly with the respective ICD-10 F-codes.

**Deciding on diagnoses order**

I'm evaluating the symptoms, and it's clear they're grief-specific, which makes ""Prolonged Grief Disorder"" the primary choice. The second one could be ""Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder,"" capturing prolonged grief symptoms without meeting full criteria. I see ""Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood"" as third, followed by ""Major Depressive Disorder"" and ""Posttraumatic Stress Disorder."" I’ll ensure to note “Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder"" correctly while keeping it generic enough, finalizing everything as clearly as possible!","1.

60,"A 33-year-old man was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital because of progressively worsening paresthesia.
The patient had been in his usual state of health until 8 weeks before the current evaluation, when he began to have an abnormal tingling sensation in the toes that he described as “pins and needles.” Over the course of several days, the paresthesia extended to the feet.
Six weeks before the current presentation, episodes of headache that lasted approximately 5 minutes and affected the left periorbital region began to occur on a daily basis. The headaches became less severe after the patient took acetaminophen. He had no associated nausea, vomiting, or neck pain.
Two weeks before the current presentation, paresthesia developed in the fingertips and, over the course of several days, extended to the hands and then the forearms. One week before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. The temporal temperature was 36.9°C, the blood pressure 134/82 mm Hg, the heart rate 92 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.9. He had no rash. Sensation to light touch and pinprick was absent from the toes to the midfoot.
Screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and C viruses, and Lyme disease were negative. The blood level of folate was greater than 20 ng per milliliter (45 nmol per liter; reference value, >4.6 ng per milliliter [>10 nmol per liter]), the vitamin B1 (thiamine) level 149.1 nmol per liter (reference range, 66.5 to 200), and the vitamin B12 (cobalamin) level 235 pg per milliliter (173 pmol per liter; reference range, 232 to 1245 pg per milliliter [171 to 919 pmol per liter]). Testing for anti–myelin-associated glycoprotein antibodies was negative. Imaging studies were obtained.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed. T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, obtained before the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed mild, nonspecific, scattered foci of hyperintensity involving the supratentorial white matter; the dominant lesion, which was located in the right frontal centrum semiovale and corona radiata, measured 1.4 cm in diameter. No associated abnormal enhancement was seen on images obtained after the administration of contrast material.
The patient was referred to a neurology clinic. One week later, while the patient was awaiting an appointment in the neurology clinic, paresthesia extended into the thighs and torso. The patient was advised by his primary care physician to present to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.
In the emergency department, the patient reported worsening paresthesia and loss of dexterity in his hands. He was no longer able to play guitar. He had no motor weakness, bowel or bladder incontinence, or double vision. There was no change in sensation in his face or in articulation of his speech, and he had no dysphonia, dysphagia, or shortness of breath.
Other medical history included depression and chronic knee and ankle pain after trauma. Medications included bupropion and mirtazapine. There were no known allergies. The patient was a graduate student and lived with several roommates. He was sexually active with women. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for 11 years before quitting 4 years before the current presentation. He had consumed three alcoholic drinks daily for many years, but 1 month before the current presentation, he had reduced consumption to two drinks one or two times per week. He used intranasal cocaine three or four times per week and inhaled nitrous oxide once per week. He had last used lysergic acid diethylamide and ketamine 10 weeks before the current presentation during a camping trip in rural New England; there were ticks in the area where he had camped, but he had not found any ticks on his body. The patient had a normal diet with no dietary restrictions, and there was no history of diarrhea or unintentional weight loss. His maternal grandfather had diabetes, and his paternal grandfather had gastric cancer.
The patient was alert and interactive and followed commands. The temporal temperature was 36.5°C, the blood pressure 131/82 mm Hg, the heart rate 88 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while he was breathing ambient air. He had a flat affect but was oriented to time, place, and person. Speech was fluent with intact naming, repetition, and comprehension. Cranial nerve examination was normal. Muscle tone and strength were normal. In the legs, there was reduced sensation to pinprick and to temperature that extended from the toes to the hips and flanks, with sparing of the anterior trunk and the back. In the arms, there was reduced sensation to pinprick and to temperature that extended from the fingers to the shoulders. The reduced sensation was most pronounced in the fingers and toes. Vibratory sensation and proprioception were decreased below the shins. The reflexes were 2+ in the arms but were absent in the legs. The patient was able to touch the tip of his nose with his index finger when his eyes were open but was unable to do so when his eyes were closed. His gait was unsteady, and the Romberg test was positive.",Functional vitamin B12 deficiency from use of nitrous oxide.,nejm,"**Identifying substance codes**

I'm looking at codes from the DSM-5 where nitrous oxide is categorized as an inhalant. I think I can start with codes like F18.10 for inhalant use disorder. Then there’s F14.10 for cocaine use disorder, F10.10 for alcohol use disorder, and F32.9 for major depressive disorder. For nicotine dependence, I should refer to F17.211 for tobacco use disorder in remission. I might also consider hallucinogen use disorder due to past LSD use, maybe F19.10 for unknown substances, but it's unclear without more context.

**Evaluating substance use disorders**

I'm thinking about the most likely substance use disorders (SUDs) to list, focusing on cocaine, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, and a depressive disorder. I need to figure out the order based on what's most clinically relevant. Since the ED evaluation is for paresthesia, and nitrous oxide use might be the cause, inhalant use disorder could be primary. However, cocaine use is more frequent at 3-4 times a week, suggesting it might take precedence. Though he shows some flat affect, there aren't enough symptoms to confirm depression, making it a bit tricky.

**Defining primary diagnosis**

I believe we can set ""Cocaine use disorder"" as the primary diagnosis since there's a noticeable pattern of use. However, without clear criteria, I can't definitively diagnose. The frequency of use suggests it might meet the criteria, but the DSM specifies that there needs to be distress or impairment, which isn't noted here. There’s also alcohol use, with three drinks daily for years but no consequences mentioned. So, it's tricky. I could suggest ""Cocaine use, unspecified"" or ""Stimulant use, unspecified,"" but we lack definitive impairment criteria.

**Clarifying substance use diagnoses**

I think I can identify ""Cocaine use disorder"" but note its severity as unspecified right now. The user pattern of 3-4 times a week might indicate a moderate level, but I can’t be sure. For nitrous oxide, I should categorize it under ""Other (or unknown) substance use disorder,"" using F19.10, since it's an inhalant, so F18.10 or F18.20 will work. Then there's also ketamine, which fits ""Other hallucinogen use disorder,"" but he last used it 10 weeks ago, so that may be less relevant. Chronic pain after trauma could suggest ""Somatic symptom disorder,"" but it might not be applicable here either.

**Reviewing potential diagnoses**

I'm focusing on psychiatric diagnoses, particularly depressive disorders and substance use disorders (SUDs). For major depressive disorder, the code is F32.9, which applies to unspecified episodes. For cocaine use disorder, I might lean toward F14.10 for mild or F14.20 for moderate/severe, but I can't be sure without knowing the specific severity. Alcohol use disorder may be F10.10, and inhalant use disorder could be F18.10. For tobacco, F17.211 fits as he’s in sustained remission. I’ll prioritize inhalant use disorder as primary since it might directly relate to his symptoms, but I need to confirm any potential cognitive or somatic disorders based on the vignette.

**Compiling DSM-5 diagnoses**

I need to provide a structured list of psychiatric diagnoses according to DSM-5-TR along with their F-codes. Based on the information and keeping in mind the symptoms, here's the final list:

1. Inhalant Use Disorder (nitrous oxide) - F18.10
2. Cocaine Use Disorder - F14.10
3. Alcohol Use Disorder - F10.10

62,"A 27-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of convulsions.
The patient had been in his usual state of health until 2 years before this admission, when shaking of the trunk, arms, and legs occurred. The episode lasted approximately 4 to 5 minutes and had been preceded by a sharp pain in the back of the head that radiated to the neck, blurred vision, palpitations, nausea, and difficulty concentrating. The patient did not seek evaluation, and no additional convulsive episodes occurred during the subsequent 20 months.
Four months before this admission, while the patient was drinking alcohol at a party, his body suddenly became stiff, and he fell backward onto a table. Shaking of the trunk, arms, and legs occurred for approximately 5 to 8 minutes. He had urinary incontinence but did not bite his tongue. Five minutes later, similar convulsions occurred. The patient was taken to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. The results of computed tomography of the head were normal, as was an electroencephalogram (EEG) that was obtained over a period of 40 minutes. Treatment with levetiracetam was started. The patient was discharged home with a recommendation for follow-up evaluation at the neurology clinic of the other hospital.
Three months before this admission, the patient was evaluated at the neurology clinic of the other hospital. He reported that despite the use of levetiracetam, convulsions occurred approximately once per week. The results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, were reportedly normal. Treatment with lamotrigine was started. There was no change in the quality or frequency of the convulsive episodes.
One month before this admission, while the patient was at work, his colleagues found him on the floor, and they witnessed “shaking and clenching” movements of the trunk, arms, and legs that lasted approximately 2 minutes. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was taken to the emergency department of a second hospital for evaluation.
At least two additional convulsive episodes occurred at the second hospital. During one episode, the shaking movements became less intense when the physician’s hand was placed on the patient’s shoulder; the movements resumed at the previous intensity when the hand was removed. In addition, the patient’s eyes were closed. When the eyelids were opened manually, no nystagmus or gaze deviation was present. When the eyelids were released, the eyes shut forcefully and Bell’s phenomenon (upward deviation of the eyes when closing) occurred. The patient did not speak but was able to follow simple verbal commands, such as an instruction to squeeze the physician’s hands. In between the convulsive episodes, there were intermittent rocking movements of the upper body and nonrhythmic tremulous movements of the hands, and the patient did not speak or follow commands. After several hours, the episodes stopped, and the patient was able to speak. Admission to the hospital was recommended; however, the patient declined because of work obligations and anxiety about being in the hospital. He was discharged home.
During the subsequent month, the patient continued to take levetiracetam and lamotrigine. However, the convulsions increased in frequency to one to three times per week.
On the morning before the current admission, while the patient was at work, his colleagues noticed that he abruptly stopped speaking and began to have shaking movements of the arms and legs. Emergency medical services were called. On their arrival, the patient’s body was stiff, and there was twitching of the trunk, arms, and legs. No urinary or fecal incontinence or biting of the tongue had occurred. The patient was able to stand up from a chair and walk to the ambulance. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital.
On examination, the temperature was 36.2°C, the blood pressure 111/56 mm Hg, the pulse 83 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was awake and alert but did not speak. His eyes were open, with a primary midline gaze and blinking in response to visual threat. His body appeared stiff, with the arms and legs straightened. There were intermittent nonrhythmic tremulous movements of the trunk, arms, and legs. The patient was able to follow complex commands and to move the arms and legs symmetrically and against gravity, but there was a delay in motor activation. The deep-tendon reflexes were normal. Extensive scarring from burns was present on the face, trunk, back, arms, and legs.
Approximately 45 minutes after the tremulous movements had stopped, the patient was able to speak but with limited fluency. Additional history was obtained. He had been taking levetiracetam and lamotrigine as directed; however, 3 days before this evaluation, he had stopped taking these medications because he was unsure whether they were effective. That morning, he had felt well until he noticed a sharp pain in the back of his head that radiated to his neck, along with sudden blurred vision, full-body numbness, and difficulty concentrating. A convulsive episode then occurred that lasted up to 20 minutes; during the episode, the patient was aware of events but sometimes had difficulty hearing. He described his overall mood as “pretty good” and did not report decreased energy or chronic fatigue. There was no history of psychotic or manic symptoms, suicidal ideation, or obsessive or compulsive behaviors.
The patient had a history of a febrile seizure in childhood, as well as several concussions that had occurred while he was playing sports in childhood. He reported that during the first 6 years of life, his social supports were limited, and he had experienced maltreatment by a family member; he did not elaborate on the nature of the maltreatment. In late childhood, he was involved in a house fire and hospitalized for a prolonged period because of severe burns on the face, body, arms, and legs. He had asthma, major depressive disorder, chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and panic disorder with agoraphobia. He took escitalopram daily and lorazepam as needed for panic attacks. He was in a long-term romantic relationship. He did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs; he smoked marijuana approximately once per year and drank one alcoholic beverage per week. His father had died of heart disease when the patient was a teenager; his mother had schizoaffective disorder and post-traumatic epilepsy.
Blood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The blood lactate level was 2.4 mmol per liter (22 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.2 mmol per liter [5 to 20 mg per deciliter]) and the blood creatine kinase level 489 U per liter (reference range, 60 to 400).

64,"A 49-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of hypokalemia and paranoid thoughts.
Six months before the current admission, discomfort on the right side of the chest developed, and the patient was evaluated at another hospital.
Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a nodule in the upper lobe of the left lung that measured 2.1 cm by 1.9 cm, as well as bulky mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.
An endobronchial ultrasound–guided transbronchial needle aspiration of a mediastinal lymph node was performed. Cytologic examination of the specimen revealed small-cell carcinoma.
Five months before the current admission, the patient sought a second opinion in the oncology clinic of this hospital. The patient was counseled about the diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer and the need for additional imaging before consideration of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy. Additional imaging was scheduled, along with a follow-up appointment. The patient did not undergo additional imaging and did not attend follow-up visits at the oncology clinic of either this hospital or the other hospital.
Six weeks before the current admission, the patient noticed swelling of both legs. Ten days before this admission, the swelling had not abated, and he was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital.
In the emergency department, the patient described himself as generally healthy and did not report any chronic health conditions. He reported no fever, chills, shortness of breath, or pain. Additional history was obtained from the patient’s brother. The patient had been pursuing alternative treatment for small-cell lung cancer that included a strict diet and intravenous infusions, and he had not shared the diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer with his family until several days earlier. The patient’s brother believed that the patient was in denial about the diagnosis.
When the patient was 12 years of age, he had received a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, which had been treated with radiation therapy and splenectomy. Fifteen years before this presentation, ischemic colitis had been treated with small-bowel resection. One year before this presentation, deep-vein thrombosis had been treated with a 4-month course of anticoagulation. There was no history of psychiatric disease. He took no medications and had no known drug allergies; he did not disclose details about the infusions that he had received as alternative treatment for small-cell lung cancer. The patient lived in a suburban area of New England with his parents. He was divorced and frequently visited his children. He worked part-time as a skilled tradesman. Family members reported that he was a lifelong nonsmoker.
The temporal temperature was 36.7°C, the blood pressure 167/95 mm Hg, the pulse 80 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The patient was alert and appeared well, but he looked thinner than he had looked during his evaluation at the oncology clinic 5 months earlier. The abdomen had a healed surgical scar, and the legs had symmetric 1+ edema. The blood potassium level was 2.6 mmol per liter (reference range, 3.6 to 5.1); the white-cell count was 14,630 per microliter (reference range, 4000 to 11,000). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Ultrasonography of the legs revealed no evidence of deep-vein thrombosis.
CT pulmonary angiography of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a marked increase in the size of the left-lung mass, which now measured 9.3 cm by 4.6 cm, as well as enlargement of the mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed numerous new ill-defined rim-enhancing hepatic lesions, which measured up to 8.0 cm in diameter; an adrenal mass, which measured 4.1 cm by 3.4 cm; and thrombosis of the branches of the right portal vein. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was normal.
Supplemental potassium was administered intravenously and orally, and the patient was admitted to this hospital. During the next 3 days, additional supplemental potassium was administered. During follow-up interviews, the patient acknowledged the diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer, but he did not explain why he had not shared the diagnosis with his family or provide details about the alternative treatment that he had pursued. On the fourth hospital day, the blood potassium level increased, and the patient asked to go home. He stated that he was willing to attend follow-up visits at the oncology clinic, but he was evasive when chemotherapy and immunotherapy were discussed. The patient was discharged.
One week after discharge, and 1 day before the current admission, the patient’s father accompanied the patient to receive massage therapy and an intravenous infusion as alternative treatment. During the infusion, the patient abruptly became volatile, agitated, and angry. On the drive home, he refused to close the window and stared into the distance. He stated that doctors had cast spells on him during his recent hospitalization and that he had killed his oldest child, which was not true.
The next day, the patient borrowed his brother’s car without permission and drove across the state. After he returned home, family members brought the patient to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.
In the emergency department, the patient stated that he was “embarrassed” for being in the hospital. He initially reported no symptoms, but on specific questioning, he acknowledged fatigue, weight loss, generalized weakness, decreased appetite, and ongoing leg swelling. He reported that he did not feel confused, afraid, or worried and that he had no suicidal or homicidal thoughts or auditory or visual hallucinations. Additional history was obtained from the patient’s family members. The patient had not slept for several days. His aggressive and erratic behavior and delusions were not typical, although he could become easily angered and had a long-standing belief that his doctors had administered radiation therapy for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma to make money.
The temporal temperature was 36.4°C, the blood pressure 194/106 mm Hg, and the pulse 87 beats per minute. The patient alternated between being alert and lethargic, and he could state the names of his children but not their ages. He was cooperative but intermittently paused and stared; he was not distracted by external stimuli, but he seemed to be responding to internal stimuli. He spoke only a couple of words at a time and answered most questions by nodding or shaking his head. There was generalized weakness, which was most pronounced in the proximal muscle groups. The leg edema was unchanged, and the skin appeared abnormally tan; there was no scleral icterus, sublingual jaundice, or asterixis.
The blood potassium level was 2.2 mmol per liter, the carbon dioxide level 37 mmol per liter (reference range, 22 to 32), and the ammonia level 51 μmol per liter (87 μg per deciliter; reference range, 12 to 48 μmol per liter [20 to 82 μg per deciliter]). The white-cell count was 13,530 per microliter. Urinalysis was normal, and urine and blood toxicologic testing was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, was normal. Supplemental potassium was administered intravenously and orally, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. On the second hospital day, the blood potassium level was 2.2 mmol per liter.",Cushing’s syndrome due to ectopic secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone from small-cell lung cancer.,nejm,"**Considering delirium diagnosis**

When diagnosing delirium, I need to look for a disturbance in attention and awareness that develops quickly and fluctuates, along with cognitive disturbances. The signs—like alternating between alertness and lethargy, disorientation, and intermittent staring—support this diagnosis. Since the delusions followed an infusion and there are other medical factors at play, delirium seems plausible. I should also consider the DSM-5-TR diagnoses, like F05 for delirium and F06.2 or F06.33 for other related disorders.

**Evaluating psychotic disorder codes**

I'm looking into the potential diagnosis of ""Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder"" with codes like F19.959 for unspecified psychoactive substance use, but that focuses on substance disorders, not just psychotic ones. Another option is F19.951 for a substance-induced psychotic disorder with hallucinations. I need to check if there's intoxication or withdrawal. There are codes for stimulant or hallucinogen abuse, but since he hasn't used a known substance and his tox screens are negative, I might still consider F19.959 or alternatively F29 for unspecified psychotic disorder.

**Ranking potential diagnoses**

For the potential diagnosis of ""Delusional disorder, persecutory type"" (F22), I need to rank the top five most likely diagnoses. I think the order could be 1) Delirium due to another medical condition, 2) Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition (like endocrine), 3) Mood disorder due to another medical condition (with manic features), 4) Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder from alternative infusions, and finally 5) Delusional disorder. Some of these might overlap, but I will present them as differential diagnoses since the user requested a structured list of DSM-5-TR options.

**Listing diagnoses and codes**

I need to provide a structured list of diagnoses and corresponding F-codes without including my clinical reasoning. Here’s what I have:

1) Delirium due to another medical condition: F05  
2) Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition with delusions: F06.2  
3) Mood disorder due to another medical condition with manic features: F06.33  
4) Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder (unspecified): F19.959  
5) Delusional disorder, persecutory type: F22  

I’ve ensured that the codes align accurately with the DSM-5-TR.

**Compiling structured diagnoses**

Firstly, for the primary diagnosis, I'll go with ""Delirium due to another medical condition"" (F05). The secondary diagnoses will be: 1) ""Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.2), 2) ""Delusional disorder, persecutory type"" (F22), 3) ""Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder"" (F29), and 4) ""Other (or unknown) substance-induced psychotic disorder"" (F19.959). This covers the key possibilities while adhering to the requirement for structured diagnosis listings without adding extra details.

**Ranking potential diagnoses**

I’m considering the top five likely diagnoses. First, I’ll go with ""Delirium due to another medical condition"" (F05). Second is ""Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition, with delusions"" (F06.2). Third, I'll include ""Other (or unknown) substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder, with delusions"" (F19.951). Fourth, ""Delusional disorder, persecutory type"" (F22), and lastly, ""Paranoid personality disorder"" (F60.0). I'm weighing if ""Mood disorder due to medical condition with manic features"" (F06.33) might fit better, especially given the agitation. However, the primary focus remains on the acute psychosis.","1. Delirium due to another medical condition - F05

66,"A 65-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of depression, recurrent falls, and difficulty caring for herself.
Four years before the current admission, the patient received a diagnosis of depression that was precipitated by psychosocial stressors. She was treated with bupropion, citalopram, and cognitive behavioral therapy. The depression was well controlled until 1 year before the current admission, when she began to have anhedonia, decreased energy, sadness, and poor concentration. She resumed cognitive behavioral therapy, but her symptoms worsened during the next 4 months, and she had suicidal ideation. The dose of bupropion was increased, and treatment with trazodone was started.
Fourteen weeks before the current admission, the patient was in a motor vehicle accident that was attributed to her falling asleep while driving. After the accident, she reported increased sadness, low energy, and inability to perform her usual activities. One week later, she fell and struck her head, and she was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital. She reported that, before her fall, she had been feeling unsteady because of weakness in the left leg. A physical examination was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed hypodensities involving the subcortical and periventricular white matter, findings consistent with chronic small-vessel disease. The patient was referred to the neurology clinic of this hospital and was discharged home.
During the next week, the patient had balance difficulties and began using a walker. When she was evaluated in the neurology clinic, she reported imbalance and occasional nausea. On examination, she had a depressed affect. Strength was assessed as 5−/5 in the proximal and distal muscles of the arms and legs. Reflexes were 1+ and symmetric at the biceps, triceps, and patellar tendons and were absent at the ankles, with downgoing toes. The gait was wide-based and unsteady, with mild dragging of the left leg. A diagnosis of postconcussive syndrome was considered, and treatment with ondansetron was started for nausea. Additional tests were performed.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed increased signal intensity in the pons and in a periventricular distribution on T2-weighted imaging, without associated contrast enhancement. There was a region of decreased signal intensity in the right corona radiata on a map of the apparent diffusion coefficient. Results of electroencephalography were normal, as were results of electromyography and nerve-conduction studies of the left leg. Physical therapy was recommended, and repeat MRI was planned for 6 weeks later.
Over the next 6-week period, during sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy, the patient was noted to be less talkative, with slow processing, impaired recall, and mild inattention. Repeat MRI with angiography performed 6 weeks after the first study revealed patchy hyperintensity involving the centrum semiovale, corona radiata, internal capsule, and corticospinal tract bilaterally on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging, without contrast enhancement; the cerebral vasculature was normal.
The patient had recurrent falls without loss of consciousness and began using a wheelchair. She reported worsening sadness, anxiety, and anhedonia, and treatment with buspirone was started. On evaluation in the neurology clinic 6 weeks before the current admission, testing of leg strength yielded inconsistent results, but strength in both legs was assessed as 5−/5 with maximum effort. Dragging of the left leg was also noted to be inconsistent. There were concerns that her depression might be contributing to her neurologic changes, and further follow-up with the psychiatric service was recommended.
Five weeks before the current admission, the patient’s husband brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for an evaluation of worsening memory impairment, poor self-care, and frequent falls. The patient had stopped participating in physical therapy and was spending most of the day in bed. She reported that she had lost 14 kg during the previous 4 months. Other medical history included hypertension, diabetes, and osteoarthritis of the knees. There was a history of postpartum depression 27 years earlier that had lasted for several months. Medications included amlodipine, buspirone, bupropion, cholecalciferol, citalopram, metformin, and trazodone. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with her husband in a suburb of Boston and worked as a teacher. She was a lifelong nonsmoker, drank alcohol only occasionally, and did not use illicit drugs. Her mother had a history of anxiety and depression in her seventh decade of life. Her sister had a history of stroke.
On examination, the patient appeared tired and disheveled, with psychomotor retardation. Strength in both legs was assessed as 5/5. She had a monoplegic gait, with buckling of the left leg, when walking down a hallway, but she had a normal gait when walking on a treadmill. Her score on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment was 25, indicating mild cognitive impairment; scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function. The complete blood count, results of liver-function and kidney-function tests, and blood levels of cobalamin, thyrotropin, and electrolytes were normal. Screening for syphilis, Lyme disease, and the human immunodeficiency virus was negative, as was urine toxicologic screening. After an evaluation by a neurology consultant, the patient was voluntarily admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit.
While the patient was in the hospital, the dose of citalopram was tapered, and treatment with desvenlafaxine and amphetamine–dextroamphetamine was started; her levels of attention and wakefulness increased. She participated in group psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and occupational and physical therapy. She continued to have variable weakness in the left leg and had three witnessed falls, during which she reportedly had fatigue and lowered herself to the ground.
On hospital day 11, the patient reported being unable to use her left arm because of weakness. Although her left arm rested across her chest for most of the day, she was observed holding her husband’s hand with her left hand when saying goodbye. On evaluation by a neurology consultant, strength in the left arm was assessed as 5/5. The working diagnosis was functional neurologic disorder. On hospital day 12, the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation center.
At the rehabilitation center, the patient received physical, occupational, and speech therapy, as well as medications to treat depression. During the first week, she made progress toward independence in bathing, toileting, and grooming but had limited attention, memory, and problem solving. During the second week, she became more withdrawn. There was a paucity of speech with hypophonia, decreased attention, and less eye contact with visitors who sat on her left side than with visitors who sat on her right side. During the third week, the patient stopped answering questions and following commands. She was evaluated again in the emergency department of this hospital.
On examination, the temperature was 36.7°C, the blood pressure 141/90 mm Hg, the pulse 98 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was withdrawn and minimally interactive. She was able to state her name but not the date or location. She did not blink in response to threat on the left side and did not track the examiner’s finger past the midline to the left. There was flattening of the left nasolabial fold. The left arm was hypertonic and held in flexion; there was no spontaneous movement of the left arm or leg, and she declined to participate in a strength examination. She did not withdraw the left arm in response to nail-bed pressure; she withdrew the left foot with antigravity movement in response to tactile stimulation.
The white-cell count was 12,940 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), with a normal differential count. The remainder of the complete blood count was normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests and blood levels of electrolytes.",Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,nejm,"**Evaluating diagnostic possibilities**

I’m considering the appropriate diagnoses regarding a major neurocognitive disorder with an uncertain cause. The instructions call for the top 5 most likely diagnoses, and it’s fine to include unspecified categories. 

1. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe, without psychotic features. 
2. Functional neurological symptom disorder with weakness.
3. Unspecified neurocognitive disorder or major neurocognitive disorder, possibly due to vascular disease. 
4. Unspecified anxiety disorder.
5. Delirium due to another medical condition or catatonia.

I need to decide based on her previous mild cognitive impairment and current presentation.

**Exploring potential diagnoses**

I’m analyzing neurological deficits like left neglect and facial droop, which suggest a stroke and could contribute to delirium, though that's not typical. The mild WBC elevation might point to an infection, but there’s no mention of key delirium features. Her gradual decline over a few weeks in rehab leading to mutism could indicate catatonia from severe depression alongside neurological signs. 

For the psychiatric list, I could include catatonia associated with a mood disorder or consider ""Depressive disorder due to another medical condition"" instead of major depressive disorder. Also, I need to rule out somatic symptom disorder and personality disorders, but ""Factitious disorder"" or malingering might still be relevant.

**Assessing possible diagnoses**

I’m reviewing the inconsistent neurological deficits. There’s no evidence of intentional feigning, making functional neurological disorder (FND) seem more plausible. So, my list of potential diagnoses includes:

1. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe, without psychotic features.
2. Functional neurological symptom disorder with weakness or paralysis.
3. Major neurocognitive disorder, possibly due to vascular disease or unspecified.
4. Unspecified anxiety disorder.
5. Catatonia associated with another mood disorder or delirium due to another medical condition.

Now I need to clarify whether catatonia or delirium is more likely, especially considering her withdrawal and decreased attention during rehab.

**Analyzing potential conditions**

Delirium usually has a fluctuating course and acute onset, alongside symptoms like inattention and disorganized thinking. However, the patient in question is minimally interactive and doesn't respond typically, suggesting focal neurological deficits instead. This could indicate major neurocognitive disorder (NCD) or a stroke. 

Catatonia doesn't usually present with neglect or facial droop, so I should consider “Delirium due to another medical condition” due to these cognitive changes. To fill out the diagnosis list, I can include unspecified neurocognitive disorder and then balance it with depression, functional neurological disorder (FND), and anxiety, but I need five diagnoses total. This seems plausible!

**Finalizing possible diagnoses**

I’m working on selecting the most appropriate diagnoses for this case. Therefore, my list includes:

1. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe, without psychotic features (F33.2) as the primary diagnosis.
2. Functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder) with weakness or paralysis (F44.4) as a comorbid condition.
3. Major neurocognitive disorder due to vascular disease (F01.50), reflecting possible underlying cognitive decline.
4. Unspecified anxiety disorder (F41.9) as another comorbidity.
5. Delirium due to another medical condition (F05) as a differential diagnosis.

Balancing these considerations should meet the user’s request for structured diagnoses while addressing potential overlaps and comorbidities.

**Deciding on diagnoses**

I’m weighing the diagnosis options for this case, focusing on catatonia and delirium. Catatonia is plausible given the mutism and observed symptoms, but there’s evidence of focal neurological deficits that could indicate delirium or a neurocognitive disorder due to vascular disease. My current top five diagnoses will include:

1. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe, without psychotic features (F33.2).
2. Functional neurological symptom disorder with weakness (F44.4).
3. Major neurocognitive disorder due to vascular disease (F01.50).
4. Unspecified anxiety disorder (F41.9).
5. Delirium due to another medical condition (F05). 

This list reflects the most relevant conditions supported by the information available!

**Generating the final diagnoses list**

I’m finalizing the structured list of psychiatric diagnoses. Here’s what I have:

1. Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode, severe, without psychotic features - F33.2  
2. Functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder) - F44.4  
3. Major neurocognitive disorder due to vascular disease - F01.50  
4. Unspecified anxiety disorder - F41.9  
5. Delirium due to another medical condition - F05

70,"A 54-year-old man was evaluated by the neuropsychology service of this hospital because of irritability, confusion, and odd behaviors.
The patient had been in his usual state of health until 9 months before the current evaluation, when he received a diagnosis of squamous-cell carcinoma of the tongue that had metastasized to the cervical lymph nodes. He underwent surgical dissection of the neck and resection of the tongue base on the right side, followed by adjuvant radiation therapy, which resulted in cancer remission. After treatment, neck pain and shoulder weakness developed and was attributed to postoperative neuropathy involving the right spinal accessory nerve.
In the context of this illness and persistent pain, the patient sought care at the cancer center behavioral medicine clinic of this hospital and received a diagnosis of adjustment disorder with depression and anxiety. During the next 8 months, the patient was seen for psychotherapy approximately every 2 weeks. Treatment for the pain included physical therapy, occupational therapy, massage therapy, acupuncture, trigger-point injections, and the use of a scapular elevation brace. Therapy with oxycodone, methadone, gabapentin, tizanidine, and duloxetine was started. Four months before the current evaluation, a sural nerve graft was placed in the right spinal accessory nerve from the proximal, functioning portion to the distal portion, but the pain and weakness did not abate.
Six weeks before the current evaluation, the patient did not respond to telephone calls for 24 hours. The police were called and found the patient unresponsive with prescription medication bottles nearby. Emergency medical services personnel arrived, and the initial evaluation, in the patient’s home, was notable for a severely decreased respiratory rate. Naloxone was administered, the trachea was intubated, and the patient was taken to a local hospital. In the emergency department, the patient was pulseless with ongoing electrocardiographic activity. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed, and epinephrine was administered; after 4 minutes, spontaneous circulation was restored. The dose of methadone was decreased, and therapy with oxycodone, gabapentin, and tizanidine was stopped. During the subsequent 6 days, septic shock, aspiration pneumonia, acute kidney injury, and delirium occurred. When these problems resolved, the patient was discharged home.
Five weeks before the current evaluation, the patient participated in a video follow-up evaluation at the behavioral medicine clinic. He expressed embarrassment and frustration related to his apparent accidental overdose. He described persistent depression, increased anxiety, and no other new symptoms.
Two weeks before the current evaluation, the patient missed a routine video follow-up evaluation at the behavioral medicine clinic, and his family was called. For the preceding 2 weeks, they had noticed that the patient was uncharacteristically agitated, irritable, talking loudly, and verbally abusive. Odd behaviors were reported. The patient had gotten lost while driving to a friend’s house that he visited frequently, had been pulled over by police for driving erratically (with normal results on a breathalyzer test), and on another occasion, had been found walking along the highway under an overpass. He called family members repeatedly in the middle of the night, and he would not answer when the calls were returned. When the family requested a police wellness check of the patient, the patient retaliated by requesting a police wellness check of the family members. After this incident, the family was advised to take the patient to a local hospital for admission.
At the local hospital, the patient reported no symptoms and noted that he had stopped taking methadone because he was concerned about a medication overdose. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 19, indicating cognitive impairment; scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function.1 Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a nonspecific hypodensity in the centrum semiovale on the left side. The patient was told he had mild dementia. Visiting nurse services were arranged, and the patient was discharged home.
One week before the current evaluation, the patient’s family reported that he had increased confusion and odd behaviors. He was unable to recall details of conversations that had happened minutes before. He could not operate the telephone or remote control and had emptied the trash can into the toilet. He had asked for his clothes to be cut off because he felt uncomfortable. Family members had been staying with the patient every night since his recent discharge because they were concerned about his safety. A neuropsychological evaluation was requested.
The evaluation was conducted by the cancer center neuropsychology service of this hospital with the use of videoconferencing technology to reduce the risk of exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). The patient acknowledged only minimal cognitive changes and was dismissive of the family’s concerns. A review of systems was notable for fatigue, moderate depression, mild anxiety, and difficulty sleeping and keeping track of time.
Additional history obtained from the patient’s family included insomnia, lumbar disk herniation, olecranon bursitis, and an inguinal hernia that had led to surgical repair in early adulthood. He had had multiple concussions as a teenager, as well as a brief loss of consciousness during a motor vehicle collision 3 years earlier. After the collision, fatigue, headaches, difficulty concentrating, and impaired memory occurred; during the subsequent 2 years, occupational therapy was provided, and the symptoms gradually resolved.
Medications at the time of evaluation included ibuprofen, acetaminophen, duloxetine, trazodone, melatonin, polyethylene glycol, and multivitamins. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived alone in a suburban area of New England with family members nearby. He had completed a master’s degree and had had a successful career; he had taken a leave of absence from work 9 months earlier in anticipation of cancer treatment. After cancer treatment, he had been unable to return to work because of pain. He was athletic, walked 3 miles daily, and enjoyed golfing. He rarely drank alcohol and had never smoked tobacco or used illicit drugs. His family history included breast cancer and dementia in his mother, hearing loss and hypertension in his father, metastatic cancer with an unknown primary source in his paternal grandfather, glaucoma and alcohol use disorder in his maternal grandmother, and a brain tumor in a more distant relative.
On video neuropsychological examination, the patient was in no distress and was adequately groomed, with normal-appearing hygiene. His affect was irritable, and the fact that he reported no symptoms suggested limited insight. His spontaneous speech was fluent and well articulated. His thoughts were tangential, and he was frequently forgetful and easily distracted; his information processing speed was slow. A formal neuropsychological assessment revealed impaired executive functioning, marked by disinhibition and poor working memory, as well as deficits in recent memory, verbal fluency, and information processing speed.",Delayed posthypoxic leukoencephalopathy.,nejm,"**Considering differential diagnoses**

I need to identify the top 5 most likely diagnoses, keeping in mind the requirement to provide exactly five. I can include some that share a common cause without separating them. Here's what I'm considering for differential diagnosis: Major neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition with behavioral disturbance, delirium due to another medical condition, bipolar disorder related to another condition, major depressive disorder, and possibly adjustment disorder. However, I need to remember that MDD and adjustment disorder can't overlap, even if they can co-occur.

**Evaluating adjustment disorder diagnosis**

In the DSM, an adjustment disorder is diagnosed when symptoms don't meet the criteria for another disorder or normal bereavement. If major depressive disorder (MDD) criteria are met, then an adjustment disorder shouldn't be diagnosed. Since I'm not sure MDD applies, it might be best to keep adjustment disorder rather than MDD. However, I could also consider “depressive disorder due to another medical condition.” Given the context, “adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood” seems like a clear diagnosis to include, especially with ongoing stressors.

**Analyzing cognitive impairment and diagnoses**

He has insomnia, which could stem from mood, anxiety, or neurocognitive disorder (NCD). It's crucial to follow DSM-5-TR guidelines. At evaluation, he shows cognitive impairment with disinhibition. I wonder if this relates to a NEJM case discussing delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy. A primary psychiatric diagnosis could be major NCD due to another medical condition. Other possibilities include neurocognitive disorder from a traumatic brain injury, or major NCD due to vascular disease, given CT findings. We should also consider frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder as a differential.

**Clarifying neurocognitive disorder codes**

Okay, F02.81 is for major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, which includes behavioral disturbances. But, in ICD-10, frontotemporal dementia is listed separately as G31.09, yet also relates to F02.81. They mentioned not to include non-psychiatric diagnoses that don’t use F-codes, so I can list F02.81 since it is an F-code. However, having both would be redundant. It might be better to choose unique codes, perhaps adding “unspecified neurocognitive disorder” F09 as a secondary option, but I’ll avoid duplicates.

**Reviewing neurocognitive disorder codes and diagnoses**

Let’s break down the neurocognitive disorder codes correctly. F02.81 is for dementia in other diseases with behavioral disturbances, which I’ll use as primary for major NCD due to another medical condition. F01.51 is for vascular NCD, and considering the CT findings, it could be plausible. Other potential diagnoses include delirium (F05) and adjustment disorder (F43.23). Given all the information, my top five diagnoses will be major NCD due to another medical condition, vascular NCD, delirium, adjustment disorder, and possibly bipolar disorder due to a medical condition.

**Analyzing potential diagnoses**

I'm weighing the diagnosis possibilities for this case. We have major NCD due to another medical condition as the primary option, supported by cognitive deficits. Delirium might be a secondary consideration, along with adjustment disorder. We should look at mood disorders too, but probably choose just one primary mood diagnosis. Including insomnia and considering opioid-related issues are also important. My top five diagnoses could be major NCD, delirium, adjustment disorder, major depression, and insomnia disorder, but I need to be careful about overlap and ensure they truly represent distinct conditions.

**Selecting appropriate ICD-10 codes**

The user needs ICD-10 F-codes, and I'm considering various diagnoses. We can use F32.A, but maybe it's safer to stick with F32.9 for clarity. Our primary diagnosis is major NCD due to another medical condition with behavioral disturbance (F02.81). For the second diagnosis, I'm thinking of delirium (F05) and then adjustment disorder (F43.23). I might add major depressive disorder (F32.1) as well. Insomnia disorder (F51.01) is also relevant, and I need to ensure all codes are distinct but correctly represent the patient's condition.

**Structuring diagnoses for clarity**

I'm considering if it's acceptable to list both adjustment disorder and major depressive disorder (MDD) together. The DSM guidelines suggest we shouldn't if MDD criteria are met, but since the user asked for a structured list of the top five likely diagnoses, I think it's okay to provide them as differentials. First, I’ll list my primary diagnosis of major NCD due to another medical condition (F02.81), followed by delirium (F05) and adjustment disorder (F43.23). I'll ensure the final output is concise and accurate without extra commentary.

**Finalizing diagnoses**

I’ve listed the diagnoses as follows:  
1. Major neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition (with behavioral disturbance) - F02.81  
2. Delirium due to another medical condition (persistent) - F05  
3. Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood - F43.23  
4. Major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate - F32.1  
5. Insomnia disorder - F51.01  

It's important to remember that the codes don’t change with specifiers, but including the behavioral disturbance helps clarify the conditions. Now, I’ll finalize this structured list!","1.

Approximately 5 years before this evaluation, the patient’s wife noticed that the patient was becoming more forgetful and napped frequently during the day. She also noticed that he lacked initiative in his professional work; for example, he was not charging or collecting payments for services. The patient’s coworkers observed that he was having difficulty focusing and frequently required redirection when interacting with clients. The patient had no concerns other than intermittent mild headaches.
During the next few years, the patient’s wife noticed that he became distant with family, was less talkative, and lacked interest in activities that he had previously enjoyed. He made numerous costly errors at work and also had odd behaviors. For example, he entered the kitchen of a local restaurant without permission; on another occasion, he inadvertently borrowed a vehicle from a colleague without first notifying that person. In another instance, while the patient’s vehicle was stopped for a routine traffic infraction, he became irritable and briefly evaded police, incurring several legal violations.
One year before this evaluation, the patient was seen in the neurology and psychiatry clinics of another hospital at his wife’s request. He had no concerns about his neurocognitive state. He noted that he was sleeping as little as 2 to 3 hours per night but had a good energy level. He reported intermittent mild headaches. He had no sinus pain, numbness, tingling, or constitutional symptoms. On examination, the patient was alert and oriented, with some inattention and confabulation. The remainder of the neurologic examination was normal. A complete blood count and blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were results of tests of kidney, liver, and thyroid function. Tests for antinuclear antibodies and for Lyme disease were negative. The patient received diagnoses of attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder, adjustment disorder, and avoidant personality traits. Psychotherapy was initiated, and melatonin and dextroamphetamine–amphetamine were prescribed.
The patient had ongoing personality changes and difficulties with organization and daily functioning, and he was evaluated in the memory disorders clinic of this hospital at his wife’s request. She reported that dextroamphetamine–amphetamine had not improved his overall organizational abilities. Although he was physically capable of conducting activities of daily living, he required prompting to perform tasks to maintain basic hygiene, such as bathing. He no longer participated in the management of family finances; he was unable to maintain employment and was receiving disability payments. He had new odd behaviors, such as urinating in public on a few occasions and frequently and unexpectedly visiting family members’ workplaces and neighbors’ homes at late hours. He also had obsessive behaviors, such as calling his children multiple times to confirm details before a scheduled gathering. The patient was unaware of his inappropriate and unusual behaviors. He did not report having anxiety, depression, or perceptual disturbances.
Approximately 10 years before the current evaluation, the patient had received a diagnosis of Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia. Because he was asymptomatic, treatment was deferred. Two years before the current evaluation, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed for disease surveillance. There were multiple enlarged hilar and retrocrural lymph nodes, measuring up to 1.2 cm in greatest dimension, with no evidence of organomegaly or focal osseous lesions. The patient attended routine oncology appointments for disease monitoring. Two months before the current evaluation, a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel were normal. The blood IgM level was 2850 mg per deciliter (reference range, 40 to 230), and the β2-microglobulin level 2.8 mg liter (reference range, 0 to 2.7); these values had been stable since the diagnosis of Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia was established.
Other medical history included mitral regurgitation, nephrolithiasis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, bilateral knee osteoarthritis, and spinal stenosis. There was no history of head trauma, stroke, or seizure. Medications included a multivitamin and fish oil; there were no known allergies to medications. The patient did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. He lived with his wife, and his daughters and grandchildren lived nearby. He had graduated from high school and trade school before serving in the navy for 2 years; he did not serve in a combat role or have known exposure to toxins. Both of his parents had heart disease, a sister had depression, and a maternal uncle had throat cancer. There was no family history of dementia, neurologic disorders, or psychiatric disorders.
On examination, the patient was well groomed, pleasant, and cooperative. Physical appearance was normal. His Mini–Mental State Examination score was 23 on a scale ranging from 0 to 30 (with higher scores indicating better cognitive function), and his Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score was 15 on a scale ranging from 0 to 30 (with higher scores indicating better cognitive function).
Orientation was intact except for an error in recalling the date. On testing of attention, the patient had difficulty with serial sevens calculations and with the digit-span test, in which a sequence of numbers is read by the examiner and repeated by the patient; he repeated only four digits of the forward span correctly. On testing of memory, he repeated five out of five words after two trials and did not spontaneously recall any of the words after 5 minutes; he recalled three of the words when selecting from a written list of word choices. Spontaneous speech production was diminished. On testing of confrontation naming, he identified a camel when shown a picture of a giraffe. On testing of semantic and phonemic fluency, he spontaneously generated six animal names over a 1-minute period, as well as one word that begins with the letter “F” over a 1-minute period. The clock-drawing test showed good organization. The letter–number sequencing test (also known as the alternating trail-making test) revealed impaired set shifting, and Luria’s three-step test revealed impaired motor sequencing. On testing of verbal abstraction, when the patient was asked to describe how a train and a bicycle are similar, he stated, “A train is bigger than a bicycle and would crush the bicycle.” Judgment and insight were markedly impaired.
An evaluation of cranial nerve function, sensation, power, bulk, tone, coordination, and gait was normal. Deep-tendon reflexes were normal, and the toes were downgoing bilaterally. Bilateral grasp reflexes and palmomental reflexes were present. Testing for syphilis was negative. The blood folate level was 8.2 ng per milliliter (19 nmol per liter; reference range, >4.7 ng per milliliter [11 nmol per liter]), and the vitamin B12 level 258 pg per milliliter (190 pmol per liter; reference range, >231 pg per milliliter [170 pmol per liter]).
On neuropsychological assessment, social engagement was limited, with a few moments of giggling that was incongruent with the context. Spontaneous speech was fluent but impoverished. There was frequent use of the word “thing” to replace lower-frequency words and periodic use of phonemic paraphasias such as “a fenco type of thing.” Thoughts were coherent but impoverished, tangential, and perseverative. Attention and executive functioning were markedly impaired during assessments of verbal fluency, divided attention, abstract reasoning, and inhibitory control. Visual memory was relatively intact, but verbal memory was impaired in terms of encoding and retrieval. When the patient was asked to describe an image, written language was severely impaired but oral language was relatively intact.",Frontotemporal lobar degeneration with tau-positive inclusions (FTLD-tau) consistent with Pick’s disease.,nejm,"**Analyzing neurocognitive disorders**

I'm considering various possibilities for neurocognitive disorders. There's early-onset Alzheimer's and Lewy body dementia, even though hallmark features seem absent. Bipolar disorder could also be relevant. Maybe it'll fall under ""Unspecified neurocognitive disorder"" or ""Major neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition"" like neoplastic issues.

I need to extract key details such as age, history of forgetfulness, emotional changes, and previous diagnoses, along with the current evaluation which shows limited improvement with medication. There's certainly a lot to dig into here!

**Evaluating cognitive and behavioral issues**

I'm reviewing a case with significant cognitive and behavioral concerns. The individual needs prompting for basic tasks and shows worrying behaviors like public urination and obsessive calling. They deny any feelings of anxiety or hallucinations but have a moderate cognitive impairment as indicated by MMSE and MoCA scores.

Medical history shows stability with certain conditions and no evident substance issues or family history of dementia. The exam reveals attention and memory deficits, impaired judgment, and executive function challenges, alongside some abnormal neuropsychological findings. There’s a lot to unpack here!

**Assessing cognitive and behavioral patterns**

I’m evaluating a case with mixed memory issues, seeing intact visual memory but impaired verbal encoding and retrieval. Written language skills are severely affected, while oral abilities remain relatively intact. There’s a notable pattern of executive dysfunction, behavioral disinhibition, lethargy, and possibly hyperorality. 

With frontal release signs and poor insight, I’m leaning toward a diagnosis of major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Alternatively, it could be a variant of Alzheimer’s, but the early prominence of behavioral changes suggests bvFTD or a frontal variant. There’s definitely a lot to consider!

**Evaluating neurocognitive disorder possibilities**

I'm narrowing down potential diagnoses for major neurocognitive disorder and ruling out several options: not due to Parkinson's, Lewy bodies, vascular issues, traumatic brain injury, prion disease, or HIV. I also think about other medical conditions, like neoplasms or B12 deficiency, but the B12 levels aren't low enough to explain the symptoms.

For the top five diagnoses I might consider, they include major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal degeneration and early-onset Alzheimer's with behavioral disturbances, which fits given the age of 62. Got to clarify those details further!

**Sorting through potential diagnoses**

I'm examining possible major neurocognitive disorder (NCD) diagnoses based on various factors. I've ruled out several conditions like Parkinson's, Lewy bodies, and vascular disease. The primary focus is on ""Major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration"" with behavioral disturbances. For secondary diagnoses, I’m considering early-onset Alzheimer's with behavioral disturbances and possibly vascular dementia, but without strong support for vascular history.

I also think about unspecified neurocognitive disorder options, but I need to ensure they're presented with correct ICD-10 F-codes. I’m gathering my thoughts for a structured list of the top five most likely diagnoses based on all this information!

**Organizing potential psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm evaluating the best psychiatric diagnoses to list, sticking to valid F-codes. While I could consider F07.0 for personality changes or F06.34, the focus is clearly on providing structured DSM-5-TR diagnoses. Exclusions include ADHD and adjustment disorders due to lack of onset evidence, and insomnia disorder seems insufficient too.

I'm leaning toward including ""Major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration"" as the primary diagnosis, alongside ""Major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease, early onset."" I think “Major neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition” is possible too, maybe for a neoplasm. This feels like the best approach to meet the criteria!

**Detailing possible diagnoses**

I’m sorting through the best diagnoses to include, focusing on valid F-codes. F01.51 is confirmed valid. I’m considering whether to use F02.81 for Lewy body dementia, but utilizing it multiple times might not be ideal. I want to ensure we have a clear, distinct list without unnecessary duplicates.

It's logical to prioritize major neurocognitive disorders for this case. I think including personality change due to another medical condition and bipolar disorder could strengthen the differential, but the evidence is tenuous. Ultimately, I need to finalize a top 5 list that reflects plausible psychiatric conditions, while keeping the codes valid!

**Determining final diagnoses**

I’m evaluating possible diagnoses for the case, focusing on those most applicable. It's complex because I need plausible options. While considering various neurocognitive disorders, I should ensure not to include unlikely diagnoses just to fill a list. 

Ultimately, I’m planning to include major neurocognitive disorders with specific codes, aiming for five that cover possibilities while also ensuring diagnostic validity. I want to make sure each code reflects plausible scenarios for the condition described, so careful selection is key!

**Creating final diagnosis list**

I'm crafting the final list of diagnoses with their corresponding F-codes, strictly following the user's instructions. The primary focus is on major neurocognitive disorders with behavioral disturbances, ensuring I use the correct DSM-5 terminology. 

I’ll list the top five likely diagnoses in a clear format without any additional reasoning or explanations. Here goes:

1. Major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, with behavioral disturbance - F02.81 
2. Major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease, early onset, with behavioral disturbance - F00.01

73,"A 64-year-old Haitian-American man was evaluated at the geriatric psychiatry clinic of this hospital for chronic depression, intrusive thoughts, and fear of being poisoned.
During the evaluation, the patient described his mood as “not that good.” He reported depression, which he rated as 4 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe depression). He had been having an ongoing “depressive episode” during the past 3 months, which had led him to call in sick to work frequently. He had passive suicidal ideation, questioning whether life was worth living; however, he had no specific intent or plan and no thoughts of harming other people. The patient had a history of nightmares, but they had not occurred during the past 3 months. In the 3 years before this evaluation, his startle response had been increased and flashbacks frequently occurred; however, at the time of the evaluation, his startle response was reduced and there were no flashbacks. He reported that women had attempted to poison his coffee. There were no auditory or visual hallucinations. He reported limited energy, difficulty initiating sleep, repeated early morning awakenings, and anorexia. There was no weight loss, difficulty concentrating, or history of headaches, seizure, or head trauma.
The patient’s medical history included diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, seasonal allergies, mild intermittent asthma, eczema, and chronic lower back pain associated with a motor vehicle accident that had occurred 20 years earlier. Medications included bupropion, quetiapine, aspirin, atorvastatin, ezetimibe, amlodipine, fosinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, metformin, and vitamins B12 and D3, as well as fexofenadine, naproxen, sildenafil, and inhaled albuterol as needed. Adverse drug effects included dry and painful mouth with paroxetine, reduced libido with paroxetine and citalopram, orthostatic hypotension and falls with prazosin, nausea and vomiting with lisinopril, and elevated aminotransferase levels with statins.
The patient had a family history of dyslipidemia; his brother had died of premature myocardial infarction, and his father had undergone coronary-artery bypass grafting. He had an adult child, who was healthy. There was no history of neuropsychiatric disease or substance use disorder in first-degree relatives, but male maternal cousins had major depressive disorder and schizophrenia. He worked full-time as a counselor. He visited a psychic every few weeks and was undergoing training to become a psychic and read tarot cards. He had formerly smoked a few cigarettes daily and had quit smoking when he was 30 years of age. He drank one alcoholic beverage on weekend nights and did not use illicit drugs.
The patient grew up in Haiti. His parents were devout Catholics, but many community members and relatives observed Vodou and Santeria beliefs and also practiced tarot card reading; the patient and his siblings began following Vodou and Santeria practices during adolescence. In his early life, the patient witnessed an act of police brutality in which a community member was killed, as well as the poisoning of colleagues of his father, who was a government employee. In his early adulthood, the patient immigrated to the United States. He lived in an urban area of New England, where he completed college and then worked as a counselor. He reported that he had experienced recurrent discrimination by female supervisors during his employment. In his early years of working, he encountered financial difficulties and was evicted from his apartment. During a 2-month period of homelessness, he became a victim of sexual and physical assault and subsequently had depressive symptoms, flashbacks, nightmares, and intrusive thoughts of the assault. He reported that he had not had any psychiatric symptoms before the assault.
The patient was married for a brief period and then divorced. He reported that his ex-wife had “put a Vodou curse on me” and that he had traveled to Haiti to have the curse removed but “the damage cannot be undone.” For decades, he feared that female coworkers would try to poison him. For this reason, he did not drink coffee that had been unattended in the office, did not accept offers from coworkers to bring him coffee from a local shop, and avoided eating with colleagues. He felt that people at work did not like him. He described extreme self-consciousness and was concerned that people in either a professional or social setting would see “discoloration” when they looked at his face.
In his early adulthood, the patient had sought weekly therapy at another hospital because of depressive symptoms, intrusive thoughts, and nightmares. Four years before the current consultation, and again 1 year later and 18 months after that, he sought care at psychiatry clinics at other hospitals. Meanwhile, he continued to receive care from the same therapist for approximately three decades.
Additional history was obtained from the patient’s therapist. The persecutory beliefs had been long-standing, occurring over a period of decades; they became more prominent when depressive symptoms were more active, but they were still present during periods of euthymia. The therapist observed that the patient’s persecutory beliefs affected interpersonal relationships and led to the feeling of isolation at work.
The patient had undergone multiple trials of psychopharmacologic medications for the treatment of recurrent major depressive episodes, which would occur approximately two times each year and last for several weeks to months. These medications included nortriptyline, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine, citalopram, escitalopram, bupropion, and valproic acid. He had tried prazosin, which decreased the frequency of nightmares but was discontinued owing to orthostatic hypotension. He had undergone EMDR (eye movement, desensitization, and reprocessing) therapy, but nightmares occurred up to three times per month and intrusive thoughts of the sexual trauma occurred daily. Olanzapine and aripiprazole did not reduce paranoid thoughts; quetiapine had a modestly beneficial effect.
On examination, the patient was a well-groomed older man with no abnormal facial features. His posture and gait were normal. He was calm and cooperative, with normal eye contact and speech of an appropriate rate and volume. He was oriented to time, place, and situation, with intact attentiveness and ability to recall autobiographical and historical information. His mood was described as mildly sad and anxious with a constricted affect. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.
On laboratory testing performed at another hospital during the 6 months before the current evaluation, the complete blood count and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were levels of electrolytes, thyrotropin, and folate. The glucose level was 131 mg per deciliter (7.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]). The glycated hemoglobin level (7.0%; reference range, 4.3 to 6.4) had increased from a level of 6.4% obtained 6 months earlier. An electrocardiogram obtained 4 months before the current evaluation showed sinus rhythm with a normal corrected QT interval.",Post-traumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder in the context of culturally and religiously derived beliefs and behaviors.,nejm,"**Reviewing ICD-10 Codes**

I’m checking the ICD-10 codes for various disorders. For delusional disorder, it’s F22. The codes for major depressive disorder detail different severities, and I’m considering F33.1 for moderate. PTSD is F43.10, social anxiety disorder is F40.10, and body dysmorphic disorder is F45.22. I wonder if BDD might be more relevant than paranoid personality disorder (F60.0). I’m weighing evidence since there’s a concern about perceived appearance defects that could align with either diagnosis.

**Evaluating Possible Diagnoses**

I’m considering exam findings that show no clear abnormal features, which might suggest a non-psychiatric issue. While he’s extremely self-conscious, indicating social anxiety, body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) doesn't seem strongly supported. He has longstanding distrust of female coworkers, hinting at paranoid personality disorder (PPD), but that feels delusional. Other potential diagnoses like schizophrenia or persistent depressive disorder seem unlikely, especially without psychotic symptoms. Avoidant personality disorder could apply, but it relates more to poisoning fears than feelings of inadequacy. Somatic symptom disorder might fit, but it doesn’t quite align either.

**Selecting Diagnoses**

I'm thinking we might go with ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder"" instead of PTSD if the criteria aren’t fully met, though I’m inclined to keep PTSD in the list. I considered ""Major depressive disorder, recurrent, moderate, with psychotic features,"" but since the delusions persist outside of depressive episodes, that doesn't fit. I want to narrow it down to five diagnoses. The likely candidates are delusional disorder, major depressive disorder, PTSD, social anxiety disorder, and either body dysmorphic disorder or paranoid personality disorder. I wonder if social anxiety and BDD can coexist.

**Differential Diagnosis Consideration**

I’m considering that body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) often leads to social anxiety and avoidance, but they don’t have to go hand-in-hand. I should create a structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses for this case, focusing on the top five most likely ones, including possible rule-outs. I’m thinking BDD and social anxiety disorder could both be present, but it’s tricky to decide which is more likely. The mention of perceived facial discoloration suggests BDD, although he seems self-conscious enough that social anxiety could also fit. However, BDD might be less supported due to the lack of repetitive behaviors.

**Choosing Top Diagnoses**

I'm considering that his extreme self-consciousness is a key feature of social anxiety. He has some suspiciousness, making it hard to decide between social anxiety disorder (F40.10) and body dysmorphic disorder (BDD, F45.22). Paranoid personality disorder (PPD, F60.0) may be relevant due to his longstanding suspiciousness, but the delusional intensity hints at delusional disorder instead. He works full-time but feels isolated, which could support PPD.

After weighing all the options, I think the top five diagnoses should include delusional disorder, major depressive disorder, PTSD, PPD, and social anxiety disorder. However, I’m still uncertain about including BDD, as it might not fit as well.

**Finalizing Diagnoses**

I'm pondering the possibilities for the primary and secondary diagnoses. Initially, I'm considering ""Schizoaffective disorder,"" but I think ""Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia)"" might fit his chronic symptoms better. I also want to explore ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder"" but note that PTSD is already included. 

Ultimately, I'm debating whether ""Delusional disorder"" should take precedence, alongside major depressive disorder, PTSD, social anxiety disorder, and potentially paranoid personality disorder. Although, I'm questioning if paranoid personality disorder provides enough evidence, and body dysmorphic disorder might be a better fit due to the discoloration concern. So I finally decide on delusional disorder, recurrent MDD, PTSD, social anxiety disorder, and either PPD or BDD as the final diagnoses.

**Deciding on Diagnoses**

I’m weighing the possibility of diagnosing both PTSD and Delusional disorder, but I need to be careful. His fears of poisoning stem from trauma, which points toward PTSD. However, he claims that his delusions started after an assault—this complicates things. 

I'm considering Major depressive disorder with psychotic features as a primary diagnosis, since his beliefs intensify with depression. It seems many factors point toward delusional disorder as a leading diagnosis, along with MDD, PTSD, and either social anxiety or body dysmorphic disorder. I need to ensure all my choices are well-supported by his symptoms.

**Finalizing Possible Diagnoses**

I’ve ruled out OCD and ""Other specified obsessive-compulsive disorder."" Now I’m focusing on my top five diagnoses: 

1. Delusional disorder, persecutory type - F22  
2. Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode, moderate - F33.1  
3. Posttraumatic stress disorder - F43.10  
4. Social anxiety disorder - F40.10  
5. Paranoid personality disorder - F60.0  

But when considering paranoid personality disorder, I must be cautious. If suspicion arises solely during delusional disorder, it probably shouldn’t be diagnosed. I’ll consider other options too, like unspecified anxiety disorder and nightmare disorder, but they need supporting evidence, which I’ll keep in mind.

**Defining Top Diagnoses**

I need to create a structured list of the top five psychiatric diagnoses based on the user's situation. I’ll consider the most likely conditions that apply and recognize that some could be differential. 

Here’s my best guess for the list:  
1. Delusional disorder, persecutory type - F22  
2. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, moderate - F33.1  
3. Posttraumatic stress disorder - F43.10  
4. Social anxiety disorder - F40.10  
5. Unspecified anxiety disorder - F41.9  

However, I should confirm that these choices reflect the evidence presented and are appropriate given the context.

**Finalizing Diagnosis List**

I’m compiling a structured list of five psychiatric diagnoses with their ICD-10 codes. The finalized diagnoses are as follows:  

1. Delusional disorder, persecutory type - F22  
2. Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode, moderate - F33.1  
3. Posttraumatic stress disorder - F43.10  
4. Social anxiety disorder (social phobia) - F40.10  
5. Body dysmorphic disorder - F45.22  

This formatting should be clear and standardized, and I've double-checked everything to ensure accuracy. Ready to deliver!","1. Delusional disorder, persecutory type - F22

77,"A 32-day-old male infant was transferred to the emergency department and admitted to this hospital for evaluation of suspected abusive head trauma.
On the evening of admission, the patient’s mother called emergency medical services and reported that the patient had fallen. The mother reported that the infant had been well until that evening, when she placed him on her bed before briefly stepping a short distance away to warm up a bottle of formula in the microwave. She heard a thud and then returned to find that the baby had fallen less than 1 m (2 to 3 ft) from the bed to the hardwood floor, where he was lying face down and crying. She picked him up immediately to console him. After continuing to cry for several minutes, the patient suddenly became quiet; this behavior was worrisome to the mother and prompted her to call for emergency medical assistance. During the phone call, the baby resumed crying. On arrival of emergency medical services personnel several minutes later, the infant appeared well and was bottle-feeding without difficulty; there were no signs of injury. He was transported by ambulance to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation.
At the other hospital, the patient’s mother reported that the baby had not lost consciousness or vomited during the event and was behaving normally. On examination, the patient was alert, regarded the examiner, cried when he was undressed, and calmed when he was swaddled. The vital signs were normal. The head was normocephalic and atraumatic. There were no bruises or subconjunctival hemorrhages, and results of abdominal, musculoskeletal, and neurologic examinations were normal, as was the remainder of the physical examination.
Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed scattered punctate densities in the right and left superior occipital lobes, a density (3 mm in diameter) extending along the left tentorial leaflet, mild prominence of both opercula, and mild diffuse prominence of the extraaxial spaces.
A report of suspected abusive head trauma was filed with the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families, and the patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.
On arrival at this hospital, a history was obtained from the patient’s mother. The patient was born at another hospital after 37 weeks of gestation; labor was induced because of maternal preeclampsia, and the infant was delivered vaginally. At delivery, a nuchal cord was unwrapped from the baby’s neck. He received routine newborn care and was feeding and growing well. Two weeks before the current evaluation, he was seen in the emergency department of the first hospital because of three episodes of vomiting; abdominal ultrasonography performed during that visit did not reveal findings consistent with pyloric stenosis. During the 10 to 14 days before the current evaluation, the patient was fussy. He had a diaper rash, for which his pediatrician prescribed topical nystatin; in addition, his mother was applying a zinc oxide–containing cream to the rash. He took no other medications and had no known allergies. His mother had a history of asthma, post-traumatic stress disorder, and anxiety; she had placed frequent calls to emergency medical services because of concerns about her health but was often reassured by the responding personnel and not transported to a hospital. Both of the patient’s maternal grandparents had a history of substance use disorder, and his maternal grandmother had died of a heroin overdose.
The patient lived with his mother in housing funded by the Department of Mental Health. They were visited each week by a case manager and received social support from an aunt. The patient’s mother was a high school graduate and was certified as an emergency medical technician; she had been in the custody of the Department of Children and Families during adolescence and had a 2-year-old daughter who had been placed with the aunt at the recommendation of the Department of Children and Families because of concerns about the mother’s mental health issues. Although the case involving the daughter was closed, the mother reported that she still had contact with her former social worker, who continued to provide support. The pregnancy with the patient was unplanned and occurred near the beginning of the mother’s relationship with the father of the baby; this relationship was characterized by young age and intimate-partner violence, and the couple separated before the birth of the infant. The mother was the patient’s primary caregiver, although on two occasions (the most recent one occurring 6 days before this evaluation), the baby had spent time with his father.
On examination, the patient was alert and vigorous and appeared well. The temperature was 36.6°C, the pulse 161 beats per minute, the blood pressure 86/50 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 56 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 3.99 kg (18th percentile), the length 53 cm (17th percentile), and the head circumference 35 cm (2nd percentile). There were no exterior signs of facial or scalp trauma, and the anterior fontanelle was soft and flat. An intraoral examination did not reveal lesions; the lingual frenulum was intact. The abdomen was soft, without distention, tenderness, or masses. Examination of the skin revealed scattered skin-colored papules (1 mm in diameter) on the chest and face, a crescent-shaped erythematous patch above the right nipple, a blanching erythematous macule (3 mm in diameter) on the left buttock, erythema of the intergluteal cleft, and a scratch (3 mm by 2 mm) behind the left knee. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and additional imaging studies were obtained.
Susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), performed 16 hours after the head CT, revealed a lobular focus of hemorrhage (15 mm by 2 mm) in the right superior occipital gyrus that was probably chronic and corresponded to the 2-mm punctate density seen on non–contrast-enhanced CT. A similar focus of hemorrhage in the left superior occipital gyrus was also probably chronic. A focus of hemorrhage in the right caudothalamic groove and two foci of hemorrhage or mineralization (3 mm in diameter) in the bilateral choroid plexuses were also seen.",Intraparenchymal and intracranial hemorrhage presumably due to birth trauma.,nejm,"**Evaluating diagnostic interpretations**

I’m considering that the evaluation could focus on suspected abusive head trauma, corresponding to ""Child physical abuse, suspected,"" which is coded Z04.72. But wait, Z04.72 refers to encountering examination due to alleged child physical abuse, not F. Still, I might include ""Parent-child relational problem"" coded Z62.820, though the requirement is F-codes only. We should identify the top five probable psychiatric diagnoses for the mother, even though the vignette revolves around the infant. But is diagnosing the mother acceptable in this context?

**Considering diagnoses for the case**

In this case, I can assign potential diagnoses to the mother, but the output should focus on a list rather than specifying individuals. While this could create some ambiguity, I need to ensure I only include diagnoses backed by clear information. The mother might have ""post-traumatic stress disorder"" and ""anxiety,"" which could be coded as unspecified anxiety disorder F41.9 for safety. There’s also a history of substance use in the maternal family, but it’s not directly related to the patient. I’m considering illness anxiety disorder or somatic symptom disorder based on her frequent calls to EMS, so I might include those as secondary possibilities.

**Choosing appropriate diagnoses**

I have to make some decisions here. One possibility is ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety"" related to postpartum issues, but that hasn't been specified. The mother lives in DMH-funded housing and has a case manager visiting, plus a previous child was placed with an aunt due to mental health concerns, suggesting serious issues may be at play. We might consider diagnoses like ""Borderline personality disorder"" or ""bipolar disorder,"" but again, there aren’t clear symptoms. Since the infant appears to have no diagnoses, maybe we use F99 (""Mental disorder, not otherwise specified"") and other F codes for the mother. However, that might feel inconsistent. It’s tricky to figure out the best approach for this situation.

**Interpreting the vignette carefully**

It seems they’ve given us a medical vignette without a psychiatric diagnosis, which might suggest there isn't one, but they've emphasized F-codes, creating some uncertainty. I need to stick to the instructions without fabricating anything. I could consider ""F91.8 Other conduct disorders"" for the potential perpetrator, but that feels off. Alternatively, coding ""abusive head trauma"" as ""battering/child maltreatment"" could apply, but I can't find a suitable F-code there. The correct approach might be to focus on psychiatric diagnoses that relate to the caregiver based on the history provided instead.

**Identifying maternal diagnoses**

The mother exhibits PTSD and anxiety, possibly with conditions like postpartum depression. I can list likely diagnoses based on the information we have: unspecified anxiety (F41.9), PTSD (F43.10), illness anxiety disorder (F45.21), and somatic symptom disorder (F45.1). Frequent EMS calls reflect health anxiety. She has a concerning history with DCF and trauma, but we can’t diagnose serious mental illnesses due to lack of explicit symptoms. I could include ""Unspecified mental disorder"" (F99) for potential issues, and consider ""Postpartum depression"" (F53.0). It's challenging to meet five diagnoses while ensuring each is supported by information.

**Focusing on maternal diagnoses**

The mother has PTSD and unspecified anxiety, with continued possibilities for other conditions like illness anxiety or somatic symptom disorder based on her frequent EMS calls. While she may have some traits that suggest personality disorder or panic disorder, there’s insufficient evidence to support them. I need to create a robust list and include PTSD (F43.10), illness anxiety disorder (F45.21), and unspecified anxiety disorder (F41.9). We can categorize the maternal mental health concerns but must adequately support each diagnosis with specific information without fabrication. As for the infant, it seems there’s no appropriate DSM-5 diagnosis available.

**Determining psychiatric diagnoses**

The user's request is clear: I need to provide a list of five psychiatric diagnoses with corresponding codes based on a clinical vignette. While there are considerations regarding the mother's PTSD and anxiety, along with maternal grandparents’ histories, the task requires sticking strictly to providing diagnoses without reasoning. I can list PTSD (F43.10), unspecified anxiety (F41.9), and potentially include substance use disorder related to the grandmother. But crafting a complete list to ensure 5 while adhering to only psychiatric diagnoses is tricky; I'll need to navigate carefully.

**Identifying potential diagnoses**

I’m considering how to provide a structured list of five psychiatric diagnoses with corresponding codes, focusing on the mother while keeping within guidelines. I have various options like PTSD and unspecified anxiety disorder for her. For the maternal grandmother, there’s opioid use disorder. Illness anxiety disorder might fit due to the frequent EMS calls, but only if these align with actual symptoms. The challenge is ensuring the correct focus on the clinical vignette without fabricating any details or straying from the required F-codes.

**Assessing psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm tasked with identifying potential psychiatric diagnoses based on the case details. The mother’s history, including her frequent EMS calls and current mental health concerns, could indicate diagnoses like illness anxiety disorder or PTSD. However, the challenge arises in confirming these conditions without explicit evidence of deception or abuse. I also consider family history, including opioid use disorder for the maternal grandmother. I must select a fifth diagnosis, possibly something that reflects the mother's mental health issues, while ensuring everything aligns with the requirements.

**Identifying psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm evaluating psychiatric diagnoses based on the mother's history and current situation. She has had a history involving PTSD and anxiety, with frequent calls to EMS suggesting potential health anxiety. Given her placement in DMH housing due to mental health concerns, I think I might need to include ""Posttraumatic stress disorder,"" ""Unspecified anxiety disorder,"" and relevant family history factors like opioid use disorder. While there are ethical considerations about listing diagnoses related to family members, I might lean toward listing explicitly stated diagnoses to meet the requirements.

**Exploring psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm considering potential psychiatric diagnoses based on the mother's history, including PTSD, unspecified anxiety, and illness anxiety. I think using illness anxiety disorder may be justified because of her frequent EMS calls about health concerns. However, it could also point to panic disorder or somatic symptom disorder, but there's not enough evidence.

For family history, I could include opioid use disorder due to the grandmother's overdose and other unspecified substance use issues. After reflecting, I can identify five potential diagnoses for the family and the mother that fit without much speculation.

**Identifying psychiatric diagnoses**

I’m sorting through potential diagnoses, focusing on the mother’s history of PTSD and anxiety, and the frequent EMS calls, which I interpret as signs of illness anxiety. However, I must be careful not to fabricate details. We can consider unspecified categories if full criteria aren't provided. 

I can include maternal grandparents' substance use disorders, but there's a risk in listing them as diagnoses for the patient. I think we can finalize a list, incorporating both confirmed diagnoses and certain relevant unspecified categories, to reach five diagnoses.

**Confirming psychiatric diagnoses**

I’m tasked with determining the primary and secondary diagnoses for the mother, centered on her history of PTSD and anxiety. I have to provide valid ICD-10 F-codes: F43.10 for PTSD and F41.9 for unspecified anxiety. I also think I can include illness anxiety disorder (F45.21) due to her frequent EMS calls.

I’ll also list opioid use disorder (F11.20) and other substance use disorder (F19.20) based on the maternal grandparents. These five seem plausible and should meet the guidelines.

**Verifying ICD-10 codes**

I need to confirm the ICD-10 codes for various psychiatric diagnoses. For the mother, PTSD is F43.10, and unspecified anxiety is F41.9. Illness anxiety disorder is F45.21, while opioid use disorder is F11.20, and other psychoactive substance use disorder is F19.20. 

Given that we can’t include reasoning in the final output, I’ll list the following diagnoses clearly, prioritizing PTSD as primary due to its relevance:

1. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) - F43.10  
2. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder - F41.9  
3. Illness Anxiety Disorder - F45.21  
4. Opioid Use Disorder - F11.20  
5. Other (or Unknown) Substance Use Disorder - F19.20

**Deciding on psychiatric diagnoses**

I need to identify psychiatric diagnoses for a case that includes an infant and a mother. They asked for a structured list of top 5 most likely diagnoses and their corresponding ICD-10 codes. While I’m considering labeling the diagnoses to clarify they pertain to the mother, I must follow guidelines that restrict additional reasoning. 

Ultimately, I’ll provide the following diagnoses:

1. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder - F43.10  
2. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder - F41.9  
3. Illness Anxiety Disorder - F45.21  
4. Opioid Use Disorder (severity unspecified) - F11.20

78,"A 16-year-old girl was seen in the sports concussion clinic at this hospital because of headache, dizziness, balance problems, fatigue, irritability, and difficulties with sleep and concentration after she had head trauma during a sailboat race.
The patient had been well until 11 days before this evaluation, when she was racing in a regatta and was struck in the head by the boom of another team’s boat. On collision, her team’s boat capsized. The patient was reportedly dazed and confused, but she was assisted back into the boat by her teammates and they continued to sail. Shortly thereafter, the weather became windy and the patient and her teammates were again knocked out of the boat. The patient reportedly lost consciousness for several minutes; it was suspected but not confirmed that she had been hit by the boom of her team’s boat. She was rescued and brought to shore. On arrival of emergency medical services personnel, she was awake and talking but confused. She was transported by ambulance to the emergency department at another hospital. During the ambulance ride, she was agitated and resisted care.
In the emergency department, the patient reported that she felt confused, dizzy, and unsteady and had a headache. The results of a neurologic examination and an examination of the neck were reportedly normal, as were radiographs of the cervical spine. Rest and observation were recommended, and the patient was discharged home in the care of her parents.
Eleven days later, the patient was seen in the sports concussion clinic at this hospital. She did not remember the sailing accident or the subsequent ambulance ride. Since discharge, she had been resting at home with limited activity and stimulation. She had occasional frontotemporal headaches with sharp pain, which she rated at 3 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. She also reported dizziness, balance problems, fatigue, and difficulty sleeping. The patient noted that she had had difficulty concentrating on her summer reading assignment and could not read a full page without losing focus, although she could read less challenging material for 15-to-20-minute intervals. Reading precipitated headaches. She reported that she felt irritable and impatient with having to stay home and that her symptoms decreased with activity.
The patient had a history of several sports-related injuries. When she was 13 years of age, she had a concussion without loss of consciousness after being hit in the head with a paddleboard. After that injury, she was dizzy for several days and had headaches for 3 months. The patient took no medications and had no known allergies. She lived with her parents and brother in a suburban area of New England and was an excellent student. Her brother had attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). There was no family history of headaches, learning disabilities, depression, anxiety, or seizure disorders.
On examination, the patient was alert and answered questions appropriately. On a mental-status examination, orientation, immediate and delayed recall, attention, and language were intact. The neck was not tender and had a full range of motion. Cranial nerves II through XII were normal, and there was no nystagmus. Photophobia was present, and there was pain with upward gaze; the near point of convergence was 15 cm. Both nodding and side-to-side movements of the head caused dizziness. On a Romberg test, the patient swayed mildly when she stood with her feet together and eyes closed. There were mild difficulties with double-leg, single-leg, and tandem stance on a hard surface. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.","Concussion, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, and attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder.",nejm,"**Considering differential diagnoses**

I need to outline plausible differential diagnoses: Postconcussional syndrome, mild neurocognitive disorder from traumatic brain injury, and insomnia disorder. Insomnia due to concussion fits under sleep-wake disorders with ICD-10 code F51.01, but insomnia disorder could also use F51.01 or G47.00. The DSM-5 allows diagnosing insomnia disorder even when comorbid, but it typically requires at least three months. Given the recent acute insomnia, ""Other specified insomnia disorder"" might be an option, but I'm uncertain.

**Exploring insomnia and diagnoses**

I see that the DSM includes ""Other specified insomnia disorder"" and ""Unspecified insomnia disorder"" codes, like F51.09 for insomnia not related to substances or known conditions. This might apply even with a shorter duration, but it could also relate to concussion. I have to generate five psychiatric diagnoses, making sure they’re plausible. The vignette focuses on concussion, so maybe only postconcussional syndrome and acute stress disorder fit. She has symptoms like irritability, possibly indicating an adjustment disorder with disturbances in emotions and conduct.

**Analyzing stress and diagnoses**

The patient is facing stress due to symptoms and restrictions following an event that's 11 days old, where she can't read. Adjustment disorder requires emotional or behavioral symptoms linked to a stressor within three months, causing distress or impairment. It's uncertain if her impairment is psychological or concussion-related. Mood symptoms are mainly irritability; things like ""Other specified depressive disorder"" or ""unspecified anxiety disorder"" don’t fit well. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder could be considered due to concentration issues, but there’s no prior history. I'll list potential diagnoses, including postconcussional syndrome and mild neurocognitive disorder.

**Choosing diagnoses**

I'm thinking of using F06.7 for mild cognitive disorder. There's also the possibility of adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct or with anxiety. Acute stress disorder is another option, but she lacks many intrusive symptoms. Her agitation during the ambulance ride could indicate an acute stress response, yet it's immediate and not currently applicable. For acute stress disorder, she requires more documented symptoms. Unspecified anxiety disorder might fit due to dizziness, but not really. Somatic symptom disorder could be considered if her symptoms persist, but it seems unlikely for now.

**Finalizing diagnosis options**

It seems like I should consider ""Other Specified Neurocognitive Disorder (postconcussional syndrome)"" with code F06.8, as it fits the DSM-5 criteria, even though postconcussional syndrome isn’t strictly a DSM diagnosis. I also need to identify four more diagnoses, like Unspecified Neurocognitive Disorder (F09) and Adjustment Disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct (F43.25) due to her irritability. Other possibilities might include Acute Stress Disorder (F43.0), Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9), or Other Specified Depressive Disorder (F32.8).

**Clarifying diagnosis options**

I'm thinking about the need for an F code and the evidence required for diagnosis. Considering options, mood disorder due to TBI seems unlikely since she’s irritable but not depressed. Conversion disorder and personality changes don't fit either. We need to focus on plausible diagnoses, considering her symptoms and history with the concussion. Postconcussional syndrome is a contender, but it usually requires persistent symptoms for three months. I wonder if listing ""Other Specified Neurocognitive Disorder"" might work here. I'll also examine if options like ""Amnestic Disorder"" might apply, but there are challenges either way.

**Determining diagnoses**

I'm weighing the diagnosis options here, especially focusing on using the proper F codes. For those with memory gaps, post-traumatic amnesia could indicate an organic amnesic syndrome, but that's typically associated with concussions. The primary diagnosis could be ""Other Specified Neurocognitive Disorder (postconcussional syndrome)"" to capture her symptoms. I can list other diagnoses as secondary, including ""Adjustment Disorder"" and ""Unspecified Neurocognitive Disorder."" I'll prioritize F codes and ensure we have a concise top five for clarity!

**Clarifying diagnoses**

I’m in a bit of a tangle here trying to finalize secondary diagnoses. Initially, I thought about acute stress disorder or adjustment disorder, but they don’t fit. Considering conditions like insomnia or unspecified anxiety disorder might help, but I’m not sure. I can explore ""Other Specified Neurocognitive Disorder (postconcussional syndrome),"" delirium, and adjustment disorders as options. It seems there isn’t a clear insomnia diagnosis without the requisite duration. I’ll focus on listing the most likely options with their corresponding codes. Let's keep refining!

**Deciding on diagnoses**

I’m sorting through the details to finalize the top five diagnoses based on available symptoms. There are categories like ""Other Specified Insomnia Disorder"" that could apply, but they require consideration of the duration of symptoms, and I’ve got doubts about some options. A primary choice might be ""Postconcussional Syndrome,"" but it’s tricky since it leans onto ICD-10. I’ll include several potential diagnoses while ensuring they fit with DSM-5-TR criteria. Ultimately, I want a solid list that accurately reflects symptoms!

**Choosing appropriate diagnoses**

I'm working on confirming the right diagnoses in this context, particularly for neurocognitive disorders following a traumatic brain injury (TBI). I’ve identified potential codes but need to stick to those within the DSM guidelines. The focus is on using F-codes only, which appears to eliminate some options like G31.84 for mild NCD due to TBI. I believe I can still compile a solid list of five feasible diagnoses that align with the user's requirements without redundancy. It's a bit challenging, but I think I’m on the right track!

**Determining correct diagnoses**

I’m exploring possible diagnoses for someone with amnesia following a head injury, realizing that the coding is a bit complex. It looks like I can use ""Postconcussional syndrome"" with F07.81 since it’s a psychiatric diagnosis that fits the symptoms. I can also consider other options like ""Other Specified Neurocognitive Disorder"" with F06.8 and ""Delirium due to another medical condition"" using F05. It’s essential that I accurately list these diagnoses based on the criteria from the DSM-5-TR.

**Clarifying diagnoses**

I’m working through potential diagnoses for a patient with amnesia from a head injury. The list might include ""Other Specified Neurocognitive Disorder"" with code F06.8, specifically mentioning ""postconcussional syndrome."" I’m also considering secondary options like ""Adjustment Disorder"" (F43.20) and perhaps ""Unspecified Anxiety Disorder"" (F41.9). It’s a bit chaotic, but I want to ensure each choice is accurate and meets the criteria from the DSM-5-TR. Ultimately, I need to avoid redundancy while effectively addressing the patient's symptoms.

**Evaluating adjustment disorders**

I’m considering various diagnoses, particularly around adjustment disorders. For the patient, there are options like ""Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Disturbance of Emotions"" but no strong evidence of anxiety or depression. Given her irritability, ""Adjustment Disorder with Disturbance of Conduct"" might fit, but she lacks conduct issues. Alternatively, maybe ""Other Specified Neurocognitive Disorder"" could be primary, with secondary diagnoses like ""Delirium"" or ""Unspecified Anxiety Disorder."" It's challenging to pinpoint, and I need to ensure that the chosen diagnoses accurately reflect her symptoms without fabricating details.

**Identifying sleep disorder codes**

I’m sifting through the codes related to sleep-wake disorders and trying to clarify distinctions between DSM and ICD classifications. Most sleep disorders like nightmares use codes in the F51 range, but insomnia falls under G47. However, based on the user’s request for F-codes only, I have to avoid listing insomnia. It seems appropriate to focus on neurocognitive and stress-related disorders. Possible diagnoses include ""Other specified neurocognitive disorder,"" ""Adjustment disorder,"" and others, mainly ensuring they fit stringent criteria.

**Selecting plausible diagnoses**

I'm evaluating potential psychiatric diagnoses and considering various options. For this list, I’m prioritizing five possible options, including ""Other specified neurocognitive disorder"" and ""Adjustment disorder."" I’m also contemplating ""Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions"" but wondering if it fits since the symptoms aren't clearly linked. Overall, I need to create a structured list of the top five DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses while ensuring they align with the case's context and available information, avoiding redundant or unsupported options.

**Considering primary and secondary diagnoses**

I’m thinking about potential primary diagnoses, like ""Neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury"" with the code F07.81, which corresponds to postconcussional syndrome. The diagnostic choices need to align with DSM-5-TR criteria, but I must ensure to include only valid ICD codes. I’m weighing options, including ""Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition"" and ""Adjustment disorder,"" but I need to have enough supporting symptoms. Ultimately, I aim to finalize a structured list of plausible diagnoses based on available evidence.

**Identifying plausible diagnoses**

I’m considering potential diagnoses related to the head injury and symptoms like amnesia. One option is ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder,"" but it might not be strong enough. Several F-coded options come to mind, like ""Postconcussional syndrome"" as primary (F07.81) and others like ""Delirium"" (F05), ""Adjustment disorder"" (F43.20), and possibly ""Insomnia disorder"" (although that has different codes). I need to ensure the list aligns with DSM-5-TR criteria while using valid ICD-10 F codes for clarity.

**Finalizing diagnostic list**

I’m working on the diagnoses related to the patient’s head injury and associated symptoms. We need to stick to F codes, excluding any that aren’t applicable. After considering various options, I’ve generated a potential list:  
1. Other specified neurocognitive disorder (postconcussional syndrome) - F06.8  
2. Postconcussional syndrome - F07.81  
3. Mild cognitive disorder - F06.7  
4. Delirium due to known physiological condition - F05  
5. Adjustment disorder, unspecified - F43.20  
I'm aiming for an accurate representation of the diagnoses aligned with DSM standards.

**Clarifying neurocognitive disorders**

It looks like I'm navigating the complexities of coding for mild neurocognitive disorders due to traumatic brain injury. The DSM-5-TR replaced postconcussional disorder with other terminology. While F07.81 is typically associated with mild neurocognitive issues from TBI, I’m weighing its accuracy. I think listing ""Mild neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury"" might be my best bet. However, I feel I should ensure it fits the user's requirement for F codes, potentially opting for ""Other specified neurocognitive disorder"" instead.

**Evaluating neurocognitive diagnosis options**

I'm navigating the coding options for neurocognitive disorders and considering using F06.8, which allows me to specify ""postconcussional syndrome."" For secondary diagnoses, I'm weighing options like delirium (F05) and mild cognitive disorder (F06.7), along with adjustment disorders and unspecified anxiety. It seems like the best options to include might be: 1) Other specified neurocognitive disorder (F06.8), 2) Delirium (F05), 3) Mild cognitive disorder (F06.7), 4) Adjustment disorder (F43.20), and 5) Unspecified anxiety disorder (F41.9) to align with the F code requirement.

**Determining appropriate neurocognitive diagnosis**

I'm considering listing ""Mild neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury"" with the code F07.81, but I'm questioning if that's the best fit since the user specified DSM-5-TR diagnoses. However, I think we can refer to ""Postconcussional syndrome"" as a possibility. The F code also aligns more closely with DSM recommendations. For secondary diagnoses, it makes sense to include options like delirium (F05), mild cognitive disorder (F06.7), and adjustment disorder (F43.20) based on the provided vignette. I’m weighing how to best frame the primary diagnosis to meet the user's criteria accurately.

**Evaluating diagnoses for concussion**

I'm trying to differentiate between ""postconcussion syndrome"" and ""postconcussional disorder."" With her symptoms still within the acute recovery phase at 11 days, it raises questions about diagnosing postconcussional syndrome. However, I need to provide five diagnoses, which may include ""Neurocognitive disorder due to TBI."" Despite the concerns about timing, I think the primary diagnosis can reflect ""Other specified neurocognitive disorder (postconcussional syndrome)"" F06.8, with secondary options like delirium (F05) and adjustment disorder (F43.20) to create a comprehensive list.

**Determining appropriate diagnoses**

I'm trying to assemble five diagnoses that fit the situation. For the primary diagnosis, I think ""Postconcussional syndrome"" with code F07.81 fits best. As for the secondary diagnoses, I might include ""Delirium due to another medical condition"" (F05), ""Adjustment disorder, unspecified"" (F43.20), ""Unspecified neurocognitive disorder"" (F09), and potentially ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" (F41.9). However, some redundancy seems likely. Still, I want to ensure the diagnoses align with both DSM standards and the user's needs. So, I’ll aim for clarity and accuracy by focusing on postconcussional syndrome.

**Selecting appropriate diagnoses**

I'm working on a list of diagnoses that make sense. For the primary diagnosis, I'll go with ""Postconcussional syndrome"" (F07.81). For the secondary diagnoses: I want to include ""Delirium due to another medical condition"" (F05), ""Adjustment disorder, unspecified"" (F43.20), and ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" (F41.9). I’m also considering ""Other specified neurocognitive disorder"" (F06.8) or ""Mild neurocognitive disorder"" due to TBI, but I aim for clarity and to avoid redundancy. It's tricky, but I'm focused on making this comprehensive and accurate!

**Confirming diagnoses and codes**

I'm reviewing the diagnosis options after a concussion. It seems that ""Postconcussional syndrome"" uses the code F07.81, which is likely to be my primary diagnosis. I might consider ""Other specified neurocognitive disorder"" (F06.8) for a secondary, but there's also ""Unspecified neurocognitive disorder"" (F09), and ""Adjustment disorder"" (F43.20). In terms of overall structure, I want to ensure I correctly outline five potential diagnoses while maintaining clarity with the associated ICD-10 codes. It’s a bit of a balancing act, but I think I’m getting closer!

**Last steps in diagnosing**

I’m deciding on diagnoses, starting with ""Mild neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury"" coded as F07.81 for the primary diagnosis due to postconcussional symptoms. For secondaries, I’m considering ""Delirium due to another medical condition"" (F05), ""Adjustment disorder, unspecified"" (F43.20), and ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" (F41.9). Maybe I could also add ADHD (F90.0) as a potential rule-out, but I'm weighing its necessity. It feels like a challenge to balance everything while ensuring it's clinically accurate!

**Finalizing diagnoses list**

I'm settling on the final diagnoses list. For the primary diagnosis, I'll go with ""Postconcussional syndrome"" coded as F07.81, since it's the most specific and recognized. For secondaries, I'm including ""Delirium due to another medical condition"" (F05), ""Adjustment disorder, unspecified"" (F43.20), ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" (F41.9), and ""Unspecified neurocognitive disorder"" (F09). It feels like a thorough way to cover the bases while ensuring each diagnostic code corresponds accurately. Spelling and formatting are key!","1. Postconcussional syndrome - F07.81

80,"Ashley, age 17, was referred for a diagnostic reevaluation after having carried diagnoses of autism and intellectual disability for almost all of her life. She was recently found to have Kleefstra syndrome, and the family wanted to reconfirm the earlier diagnoses and assess the genetic risk to the future children of her older sisters.

At the time of the reevaluation, Ashley was attending a special school with a focus on functional skills. She was able to dress herself, but she was not able to shower independently or be left alone in the house. She was able to decode (e.g., read words) and spell at a second-grade level but understood little of what she read. Changes to her schedule and heightened functional expectations tended to make her irritable. When upset, Ashley would often hurt herself (e.g., biting her wrist) and others (e.g., pinching and hair pulling).

In formal testing done at the time of the reevaluation, Ashley had a nonverbal IQ of 39 and a verbal IQ of 23, with a full scale IQ of 31. Her adaptive scores were somewhat higher, with an overall score of 42 (with 100 as average).

By history, Ashley first received services at age 9 months after her parents noticed significant motor delays. She walked at 20 months and was toilet trained at 5 years. She spoke her first word at age 6. She received a diagnosis of developmental delay at age 3 and of autism, obesity, and static encephalopathy at age 4. An early evaluation noted possible facial dysmorphology; genetic tests at that time were noncontributory.

Her parents indicated that Ashley knew hundreds of single words and many simple phrases. She had long been very interested in license plates and would draw them for hours. Her strongest skill was memory, and she could draw precise representations of license plates from different states. Ashley had always been very attached to her parents and sisters, and although affectionate toward babies, she showed minimal interest in other teenagers.

Ashley’s family history was pertinent for a father with dyslexia, a paternal uncle with epilepsy, and a maternal male cousin with possible “Asperger’s syndrome.” Her siblings, both sisters, were in college and doing well.

On examination, Ashley was an overweight young woman who made inconsistent eye contact but often peered out the corner of her eye. She had a beautiful smile and would sometimes laugh to herself, but most of the time her facial expressions were subdued. She did not initiate joint attention by trying to catch another person’s eyes. She frequently ignored what others would say to her. To request a preferred object (e.g., a shiny magazine), Ashley would rock from foot to foot and point. When offered an object (e.g., a small decorated box), she brought it to her nose and lips for inspection. Ashley spoke in a high-pitched voice with unusual intonation. During the interview, she used multiple words and a few short phrases that were somewhat rote but communicative, such as “I want to clean up,” and “Do you have a van?”

In the months prior to the evaluation, Ashley’s parents noticed that she had become increasingly apathetic. A medical evaluation concluded that urinary tract infections were the most likely cause for her symptoms, but antibiotics seemed only to make her more listless. Further medical evaluation led to more extensive genetic testing, and Ashley was diagnosed with Kleefstra syndrome, a rare genetic defect associated with multiple medical problems, including intellectual developmental disorder. The parents said they were also tested and found to “be negative.”

The parents specifically wanted to know whether the genetic testing results affected Ashley’s long-standing diagnoses and access to future services. Furthermore, they wanted to know whether their other two daughters should get tested for their risk of carrying genes for autism, intellectual disability, and/or Kleefstra syndrome.","1. Intellectual developmental disorder (intellectual disability), severe
2. Autism spectrum disorder, with accompanying intellectual and language impairments, associated with Kleefstra syndrome",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Considering diagnoses options**

I'm evaluating the different diagnosis codes. F32.A is new, and I’m not sure it’s widely accepted, whereas F32.9 is more recognized. I might consider F06.31, which indicates ""Depressive disorder due to another medical condition"" to reflect the connection with UTI, though I'm uncertain about its appropriateness. Additionally, F89, ""Unspecified neurodevelopmental disorder,"" doesn't quite fit. I’m leaning toward keeping it generic, but there are alternatives like F91.8, which could be more relevant and align better with the context. I’ll need to provide the top five likely diagnoses.

**Evaluating disruptive behavior disorders**

I’m thinking about potential diagnoses and which ones are more plausible. The behaviors suggest options like ""Stereotypic movement disorder,"" ""Intermittent explosive disorder,"" or ""Other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder."" Given her language impairment, I’m leaning away from depression because the apathy seems recent and possibly medical. It seems like including a disruptive behavior disorder makes more sense here. ""Unspecified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder"" (F91.9) could fit because of her clinically significant aggression, especially since she injures others when upset.

**Identifying possible diagnoses**

I'm considering the various diagnostic codes. While ASD might be the primary condition, I can still code for related issues if they are part of the treatment focus. There's ""Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder,"" but it doesn't seem to fit here. I may also look at ""Other specified impulse-control disorder,"" though that might not work either. I need to outline five conditions, especially since she has self-injurious behavior and aggression. Another thought is ""Autism spectrum disorder associated with known genetic condition,"" but that still leads back to ASD. I also ponder ""Unspecified neurocognitive disorder"" or ""Unspecified catatonia"" (F06.1), but I'm still unsure.

**Choosing secondary diagnoses**

I need to select four secondary diagnoses and I'm considering a few options. There's Intellectual disability (F72), Mixed receptive-expressive language disorder (F80.2), Stereotypic movement disorder with self-injurious behavior (F98.4), and also ""Other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder"" (F91.8). The possibility of ""Unspecified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder"" (F91.9) is worth noting too, especially regarding her aggressive behaviors.

For Mixed receptive-expressive language disorder, she has clear language delays. Stereotypic movement disorder is possible due to her rocking and self-biting. For disruptive behavior, her pinching and hair pulling are notable, but I might lean toward the ""Other specified"" option rather than ODD or conduct. Depressive disorder is not fitting since her symptoms are mostly apathy.

**Finalizing the top diagnoses**

I'm working on ranking the top five diagnoses here. My list includes:

1. Intellectual Developmental Disorder, Severe - F72
2. Autism Spectrum Disorder - F84.0
3. Stereotypic Movement Disorder, with self-injurious behavior - F98.4
4. Other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder (aggressive outbursts) - F91.8
5. Language Disorder - F80.9

It's worthwhile to clarify that the primary diagnosis could be ""Autism Spectrum Disorder"" and I might include relevant specifiers. Keeping the format concise while ensuring clarity is key!

**Determining the primary and secondary diagnoses**

I’m analyzing the diagnoses to finalize the list. For the main concerns, I’m considering:

1. Intellectual Developmental Disorder, Severe - F72
2. Autism Spectrum Disorder - F84.0
3. Stereotypic Movement Disorder, with self-injurious behavior - F98.4
4. Other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder - F91.8
5. Unspecified depressive disorder - F32.9

I’m leaning towards making ""Intellectual Developmental Disorder, Severe"" the primary diagnosis because it's most prominent due to Kleefstra syndrome, whereas ASD is secondary. This way, I ensure clarity and accuracy in addressing the symptoms present.

**Finalizing the diagnoses**

I’m working through the diagnoses to finalize a list for clarity. I’m thinking of making ""Intellectual Developmental Disorder, Severe"" the primary diagnosis, followed by ""Autism Spectrum Disorder"" as secondary. 

The list looks like this:

1. Intellectual Developmental Disorder, Severe - F72
2. Autism Spectrum Disorder, with intellectual and language impairment - F84.0
3. Language Disorder - F80.9
4. Stereotypic Movement Disorder, with self-injurious behavior - F98.4
5. Other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder - F91.8

I’ve decided to include language disorder since it’s significant, despite potential overlaps with ID. This should provide a comprehensive view of the situation!

**Finalizing the diagnoses list**

I’m working on establishing the final structured list of diagnoses with corresponding F-codes. I’m thinking that we need to select five specific diagnoses, and while the major ones are straightforward, I have to ensure I’m not overlapping or including redundant ones.

After weighing my options, my final list looks like this:

1. Intellectual Developmental Disorder, Severe - F72
2. Autism Spectrum Disorder - F84.0
3. Stereotypic Movement Disorder, with self-injurious behavior - F98.4
4. Other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder - F91.8
5. Unspecified depressive disorder - F32.9 

This should encapsulate the necessary information without redundancies.

**Evaluating diagnoses criteria**

I’m analyzing the DSM-5-TR criteria and considering comorbidity rules. Language disorder seems not applicable here due to severe intellectual disability (ID), as we cannot diagnose it if it's consistent with ID. Stereotypic movement disorder criteria may apply, as behaviors like body rocking and self-biting could lead to significant issues.

I’m weighing options for the top five diagnoses needed and considering whether unspecified depressive disorder fits due to signs of apathy. Ultimately, my structured list includes primary diagnoses of Autism Spectrum Disorder and Intellectual Developmental Disorder, along with other specified disruptive impulse-control disorder and unspecified depressive disorder.

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

For unspecified depressive disorder, there are symptoms like increasing apathy, but I think it's wise to include it as a differential, as long as there's no clear medical cause. Specifiers can be included to show nuance in diagnoses, such as for Autism Spectrum Disorder and Intellectual Developmental Disorder, especially with Kleefstra syndrome. The top diagnoses should be prioritized for psychiatric evaluation which includes ID as primary, but ASD is relevant too. I’ll finalize the structured list now.

1. Intellectual Developmental Disorder, Severe - F72
2. Autism Spectrum Disorder (associated with Kleefstra syndrome; with accompanying intellectual and language impairment) - F84.0
3. Stereotypic Movement Disorder - F98.4
4. Other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder - F91.8
5. Unspecified depressive disorder - F32.9

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

The DSM uses ""Intellectual Developmental Disorder, severe,"" and I want to ensure we specify relevant details like associated self-injurious behavior. For the unspecified depressive disorder, the confirmed code is F32.9. I’ve decided on the final list of diagnoses, considering the presence of symptoms and their implications.

1. Intellectual Developmental Disorder, severe - F72
2. Autism Spectrum Disorder (associated with known genetic condition; with accompanying intellectual and language impairment) - F84.0
3. Stereotypic Movement Disorder, with self-injurious behavior - F98.4
4. Other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder - F91.8
5. Unspecified depressive disorder - F32.9

**Confirming final codes**

I want to clarify that the ICD-10 code for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is F84.0. I need to ensure that my final response is concise and free from any extra text or disclaimers. It's important to deliver this information directly and accurately. 

So, let's get this finalized without any additional commentary!","1. Intellectual Developmental Disorder, severe - F72

81,"Brandon was a 12-year-old boy brought in by his mother for psychiatric evaluation for temper tantrums that seemed to be contributing to declining school performance. The mother became emotional as she reported that things had always been difficult but had become worse after Brandon entered middle school. Shortly after starting middle school, Brandon had started complaining of stomachaches on school-day mornings and was often reluctant to go to school.

Brandon’s sixth-grade teachers reported that he was academically capable but that he had little ability to make friends. He seemed to mistrust the intentions of classmates who tried to be nice to him but attempted to befriend others who laughingly feigned interest in the toy cars and trucks that he brought to school. The teachers noted that he often cried and rarely spoke in class. In recent months, multiple teachers had heard him screaming at other boys, generally in the hallway but sometimes in the middle of class. The teachers had not identified a cause but generally had not disciplined Brandon because they assumed he was responding to provocation. He was embarrassed about these outbursts and did not want to go to swim practice because he did not want his swim friends to ask why he’d had an outburst at school.

When interviewed alone, Brandon responded with nonspontaneous mumbles when asked questions about school, classmates, and his family. When the examiner asked if he was interested in toy cars, however, Brandon lit up. He pulled several cars, trucks, and airplanes from his backpack and, while not making good eye contact, did talk at length about vehicles, using their apparently accurate names (e.g., front-end loader, B-52, Jaguar). When asked again about school, Brandon pulled out his cell phone and showed a string of text messages: “dumbo!!!!” “mr stutter”; “LoSeR”; “freak!”; “EVERYBODY HATES YOU.” While the examiner read the long string of texts that Brandon had saved but apparently not previously revealed, Brandon added that other boys would whisper “bad words” to him in class and then scream in his ears in the hall. “And I hate loud noises.” He also told the examiner that he sometimes wished that he had never been born.

Developmentally, Brandon spoke his first word at age 11 months and began to use short sentences by age 3. He had always been very focused on trucks, cars, and trains. According to his mother, he had always been “very shy” and had never had a best friend. As he has gotten older, it has become more apparent that he struggles with jokes and typical young adolescent banter because “he takes things so literally.” Brandon’s mother had long seen this behavior as “a little odd” but added that it was not much different from that of Brandon’s father, a successful attorney, who had similarly focused interests. Both of them were “sticklers for routine” who “lacked a sense of humor.” Brandon’s mother noted that he made efforts to conceal his interest in trucks, cars, and trains outside of the home but would eagerly speak about them when encouraged. Brandon has shared with his mother that he tries to appear “normal” when interacting with peers at school, which is exhausting. He often feels nervous around peers and generally tries to avoid socializing.

On examination, Brandon was shy and generally nonspontaneous. He made below-average eye contact. His speech was coherent and goal directed. At times, Brandon stumbled over his words, paused excessively, and sometimes rapidly repeated words or parts of words. Brandon said he felt okay but added that he was scared of school, particularly when around other children. He appeared sad, brightening only when discussing his toy cars. He denied current suicidal thoughts or plans as well as homicidality. He denied psychotic symptoms. He was cognitively intact.","Autism spectrum disorder requiring support for deficits in social communication and for restricted, repetitive behaviors without accompanying intellectual impairment, with accompanying language impairment—childhood-onset fluency disorder (stuttering)",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Considering diagnoses options**

I'm thinking if we should include adjustment disorder and unspecified depressive disorder since they might overlap. Maybe ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" (F41.8) could be a better choice?

Here are a few possibilities I'm narrowing down:
1. ASD (F84.0)
2. Social anxiety disorder (F40.10)
3. Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood (F43.23)
4. Childhood-onset fluency disorder (F80.81)
5. Unspecified depressive disorder (F32.A)

I need to make sure the list of top five is structured and reflects potential comorbidities, but also differential diagnoses.

**Determining likely diagnoses**

I need to provide the top five diagnoses along with their ICD-10 F-codes. The primary diagnosis is likely Autism Spectrum Disorder (F84.0), with four additional secondary diagnoses: 

1. Social anxiety disorder (F40.10)
2. Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood (F43.23)
3. Childhood-onset fluency disorder (F80.81)
4. Unspecified depressive disorder (F32.A)

Though I considered ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder"" (F43.8), I'll stick with these. The primary focus should be on ASD, as the early history suggests it may be the underlying issue.

**Listing diagnoses with codes**

I need to provide a list of diagnoses with their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes while being cautious not to include ""unspecified"" unless necessary. Here’s the final formatted list:

1. Autism Spectrum Disorder - ICD-10 F84.0
2. Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia) - ICD-10 F40.10
3. Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood - ICD-10 F43.23
4. Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder (Stuttering) - ICD-10 F80.81
5. Unspecified Depressive Disorder - ICD-10 F32.A

There’s some confusion between F32.A and F32.9, but I’ll confirm which code aligns with the DSM-5-TR guidelines.

**Verifying depressive disorder codes**

I need to verify the coding for ""Unspecified Depressive Disorder."" According to DSM-5, the code 311 corresponds to F32.9, which relates to major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified. However, in ICD-10-CM, they later introduced F32.A for ""Depression, unspecified"" in 2021. So, I believe DSM-5-TR updated this to F32.A to reflect ICD-10-CM changes. It seems appropriate to use F32.A for Unspecified Depressive Disorder in the latest context.

**Finalizing diagnostic list**

I'm focusing on the criteria for stuttering and other diagnoses related to the user's situation. We’ve established that Brandon's stuttering fits the criteria, and his experiences warrant consideration for depression, likely an adjustment disorder, or possibly unspecified depressive disorder.

I’ve determined the top five most likely diagnoses and their ICD-10 F-codes, ensuring they align with DSM-5-TR standards. Here’s the exact list:

1. Autism Spectrum Disorder - ICD-10 F84.0
2. Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia) - ICD-10 F40.10
3. Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood - ICD-10 F43.23

82,"Carlos was a 19-year-old Hispanic college student in his freshman year at a public university in a large city. He was referred by his guidance counselor to the hospital’s outpatient psychiatric clinic for help with academic difficulties. Since starting college 6 months earlier, he had done poorly on tests and been unable to manage his study schedule. His worries that he was going to flunk out of college were leading to anxiety, insomnia, poor concentration, and a general sense of hopelessness. After a particularly tough week, he told his family that he thought he should quit. His mother accompanied him to the clinic that had previously helped both Carlos and his younger brother. The mother specifically wondered whether Carlos’s “ADHD” might be causing his problems, or whether he had outgrown it.

Carlos had been seen at the same clinic when he was age 9, at which time he had been diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), predominantly combined type. Notes from that clinical evaluation indicated that Carlos had been in trouble at school for not following instructions, not completing homework, getting out of his seat, losing things, not waiting his turn, and not listening. He had trouble concentrating except in regard to video games, which he “could play for hours.” Carlos had apparently been slow to talk, but his birth and developmental histories were otherwise normal. He repeated first grade because of behavioral immaturity and difficulty learning to read. The ease with which Carlos learned English, his second language, was not noted. His family had emigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic when he was 5 years old. The family was Catholic and attended church every Sunday. Both of his parents worked in maintenance and housekeeping at a local municipal hospital.

During the evaluation when Carlos was age 9, a psychoeducational assessment by a clinical psychologist confirmed reading problems (particularly problems in reading fluency and comprehension). Carlos did not, however, meet the school board criteria for a learning disability, which required evidence of a 20-point discrepancy between IQ and achievement scores. Thus, he was not eligible for special education services. The evaluator had noted Carlos to be eager to do well and anxious about underperforming. His anxiety was thought to be a reaction to his school difficulties and his challenges in meeting the academic expectations of his family. Carlos’s pediatrician had recommended pharmacotherapy, but his parents did not want to pursue medication. They cited negative experiences with local youth who used diverted controlled substances and hung out “on the street.” Instead, his mother reported taking on an extra job to pay for tutors to help her son “with concentration and reading.” The eldest of four siblings, Carlos had done well with this intervention and was now the first member of his family to attend college.

The psychiatry trainee carefully reviewed Carlos’s academic history; his symptoms, including the course and severity of sadness, anxiety, insomnia, and hopelessness; and his social and developmental history. She obtained collateral history from his family and school records. She used the revised DSM-5-TR Core Cultural Formulation Interview for assistance in obtaining a better understanding of Carlos’s acculturation experiences, the family’s past feelings about the clinic’s recommendations, and what treatment interventions would be relevant and acceptable to Carlos and his family.

The psychiatry trainee learned that Carlos had a childhood history of “nervousness” identified by a neighborhood curandera (traditional healer) as ataque de nervios. The family had addressed this problem with supportive prayer and a traditional herbal tea. They had apparently not revealed this to the psychiatrist at the time, thinking he would find it irrelevant and not wishing to seem disrespectful of his authority. During these unrevealed episodes of acute anxiety, Carlos would experience trembling and agitation, palpitations, shortness of breath, dread of harm, and fear of separation from caregivers. Workup by the pediatrician had revealed no physiological cause.

Since starting college, Carlos reported that he had frequently been unable to remain focused while reading and listening to lectures. He was easily sidetracked and therefore had difficulty handing in his written assignments on time. He complained of feeling restless, agitated, and worried. He described difficulty falling asleep, poor energy, and an inability to “have fun” like his peers. He reported that the depressive symptoms went “up and down” over the course of the week and possibly influenced his problems with concentration; it was hard for him to be certain. He denied substance use.

Carlos said that he’d had some great teachers in high school who had understood him, helped him get the meaning of what he read, and allowed him to audiotape lectures and use other formats (e.g., videos, wikis, visual presentations) for final assignments. Without this support at college, he said he felt “lonely, stupid, a failure—unable to cope.”

Although advised by his high school teacher to do so, Carlos had not registered with the university’s student disability services office. He preferred not to be seen as different from his peers and thought he should be able to get through college by himself.

Carlos’s family history was positive for ADHD in a younger brother. A cousin was reported to have had “dyslexia” and had dropped out of a local community college after one semester. His social and developmental history revealed that he had been well liked by his cluster of friends throughout school. His group consisted of boys and girls and tended to consist of kids more interested in school than in sports. Carlos denied ever having dated or been sexually active, and he also denied having any significant interest in pursuing either of these activities.

On examination, Carlos was well-groomed, polite, and soft-spoken. He wore clean jeans, a T-shirt, and a hoodie that he kept pulling down over his face. He sat quietly and hunched over. He sighed a lot and rarely made eye contact with the clinician. He often tapped his fingers and shuffled in his seat but responded appropriately to questions. His command of English appeared strong, but he spoke with a slight Spanish accent. He often mumbled and mispronounced some multisyllabic words (e.g., he said “literalchure” instead of “literature” and “intimate” when he clearly meant “intimidate”). He denied any suicidal thoughts. He appeared motivated to do better. On a follow-up interview with the psychiatry trainee, Carlos asked whether the conversations were confidential. When informed that they were, he hesitantly admitted that he felt overwhelmed by new relationships with college peers. He indicated that “in my neighborhood growing up, everybody was Dominican, but in college, I’m the only Dominican.” He also quietly said that he thought he might “like guys rather than girls.” He revealed two recent episodes of panic “like when I was a kid” that had occurred during social situations. He declined to go into further detail.

After these two initial sessions, the psychiatrist suggested extending the evaluation so that they could optimize a treatment strategy. She told Carlos that she wanted to better understand his mood and anxiety symptoms, as well as how he felt about being the first in his family to go to college (i.e., role transitions), and to talk a little more about his concerns about his sexual orientation. She also referred Carlos for updated psychoeducational testing. This psychoeducational reassessment confirmed that Carlos’s reading and writing abilities were substantially and quantifiably below those expected for his age. That report also concluded that these learning difficulties were not attributable to intellectual developmental disorder, uncorrected visual or auditory acuity, psychosocial adversity, or lack of proficiency in the language of academic instruction. The report concluded that Carlos had specific difficulties with reading fluency and comprehension as well as spelling and written expression.","1. Major depressive disorder, mild, single episode

3. History of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, with predominantly inattentive presentation, of mild to moderate severity; rule out current
4. Specific learning disorder affecting the domains of reading (both fluency and comprehension) and written expression (spelling and organization of written expression), all currently of moderate severity",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Clarifying learning disorder codes**

I'm looking at the DSM-5 and ICD-10 codes for Specific Learning Disorder. It seems the DSM-5 uses codes like F81.0 for reading impairment, F81.81 for written expression, and F81.2 for math. If both reading and writing are affected, clinicians might primarily use F81.0, but the question asks for a combined diagnosis with F-codes. Perhaps I could list it as ""Specific Learning Disorder, with impairment in reading and written expression,"" but I need to consider how to combine those codes.

**Evaluating diagnoses for academic difficulties**

In ICD-10-CM, it's possible to use different codes based on which impairment is predominant. I could list Specific Learning Disorder (SLD) with impairment in reading (F81.0) and written expression (F81.81) as separate diagnoses. Since they want the top five diagnoses, I also need to include ADHD, anxiety disorder, and depressive disorder. 

Considering the primary diagnosis for academic difficulties, SLD may be significant given the psychoeducational findings, but I also need to weigh in ADHD symptoms, like inattention and restlessness. It's a bit of a balancing act!

**Determining primary diagnosis**

I'm considering whether ADHD is continuing into adulthood since depression and anxiety can impair concentration too. Given this is a childhood onset case, ADHD seems likely. However, his academic problems could primarily stem from Specific Learning Disorder (SLD) along with the absence of accommodations and possibly comorbid ADHD. 

To rank the top five diagnoses, I need to decide if ADHD or SLD is the primary condition. Since he reports significant academic stress and symptoms of anxiety, updated testing supports that SLD may be the primary issue. But anxiety disorders should also be considered due to his worries and concentration issues.

**Analyzing anxiety and mood disorders**

The user's worry seems focused on academic performance, which might qualify as generalized anxiety disorder if it involves excessive anxiety about various events. However, if the worry is primarily about failing, it could point towards adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressed mood related to the transition to college. 

There's also the possibility of major depressive disorder, but symptoms are inconsistent and might suggest subthreshold depression. He experiences panic attacks and social anxiety, particularly about being Dominican and forming new relationships. It’s possible that he’s dealing with social anxiety disorder, and he may also have underlying issues like separation anxiety from childhood.

**Creating a differential diagnosis**

Given that he's away from caregivers, it's possible he has separation anxiety disorder, but that isn't currently described. There's also a chance of panic disorder, especially since he experienced two recent panic episodes in social situations. However, he doesn't meet all criteria for that.

He may qualify for adjustment disorder or generalized anxiety disorder due to his worries about academics and potential identity issues. Social anxiety disorder is also a possibility, especially given his experiences in new environments. 

His learning difficulties suggest a Specific Learning Disorder (SLD), with impairment in reading and written expression. For the top five diagnoses, I’ll list SLD, ADHD (F90.2), social anxiety disorder (F40.10), adjustment disorder (F43.23), and generalized anxiety disorder (F41.1). It's important to prioritize based on the strongest evidence.

**Evaluating diagnostic codes**

I want to clarify the coding for specific learning disorders. DSM-5 specifies using separate codes for each impairment, such as F81.0 for reading and F81.81 for written expression. However, if someone has multiple impairments, I think it's essential to assign codes based on the primary area of concern.

In this case, Carlos has difficulties in both reading and written expression. Given his history, his reading issues appear to be more significant, so I lean towards using F81.0. For ADHD, I'll consider coding it as combined presentation since symptoms have persisted from childhood into adulthood.

**Assessing anxiety and mood disorders**

I'm trying to clarify the diagnosis for Carlos. For ADHD, I think combined presentation (F90.2) is suitable given his restlessness. 
Now, regarding anxiety, he's highly worried about academic failure and has shown signs of insomnia and poor concentration. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) might fit, but his worries seem mostly academic. Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood (F43.23) might be more accurate, especially since his symptoms started with the transition to college. I’m also considering ""Other specified depressive disorder"" as part of his potential diagnosis.

**Determining possible diagnoses**

I'm considering various diagnoses for the individual. There could be Avoidant Personality Disorder or Schizoid Personality Disorder, but he has friends and seems polite, which makes it unclear. His lack of interest in dating might reflect social anxiety or confusion about his identity. Also, his mispronunciation of words suggests a communication issue potentially linked to dyslexia rather than a separate disorder.

Next, I need to identify the top five likely diagnoses. So far, I'm confident in Specific Learning Disorder and ADHD. For the remaining three, I'm looking at Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood, Social Anxiety Disorder, and either Panic Disorder or Generalized Anxiety Disorder.

**Identifying possible diagnoses**

I'm weighing different diagnoses, starting with Persistent Depressive Disorder, but it seems his mood symptoms might be secondary to adjustment and anxiety. It looks like our top five likely diagnoses should include Specific Learning Disorder (SLD), ADHD, Social Anxiety Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood.

For the primary diagnosis, I'm leaning towards SLD since it directly causes functional impairment in his college work. It's essential to recognize that his anxiety and depression might stem from the ongoing challenges he faces without proper academic support. While adjustment and anxiety are also significant, SLD appears to be at the core of his academic difficulties.

**Determining potential diagnoses**

I'm considering a range of possible diagnoses. First, there’s Specific Learning Disorder impacting his reading and writing, and then Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. I’m also looking at Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, Social Anxiety Disorder, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder.

Notably, he experiences significant anxiety around academic performance. While Adjustment Disorder seems plausible due to the identified stressors, evaluating for GAD could also fit. Ultimately, I propose a final list of five diagnoses to reflect the complexities of his symptoms.

**Structuring differential diagnoses**

I'm thinking we need a clear list of the top five likely diagnoses, even if they don’t all occur simultaneously. We might include both Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Adjustment Disorder as options, but they can’t exist together. Also, it’s essential to include Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Specific Learning Disorder since they've been confirmed. 

After careful consideration, a structured list could look like this:

1. ADHD, combined presentation - F90.2
2. Specific Learning Disorder, with impairment in reading - F81.0
3. Social Anxiety Disorder - F40.10
4. Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood - F43.23
5. Generalized Anxiety Disorder - F41.1

This balance allows us to capture the various aspects of the case while aligning with the requirements of the prompt.

**Listing possible diagnoses**

I’m considering several possibilities for the patient's top five diagnoses. First, he might experience panic attacks, which have shifted from childhood triggers to social situations. While ""Panic Disorder"" could apply, it usually requires unexpected panic, so generalized anxiety may fit better. 

For the top five, I should include:

1. Specific Learning Disorder with impairment in reading (F81.0).
2. ADHD, combined presentation (F90.2).
3. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1).
4. Major Depressive Disorder, single episode (F32.1).
5. Social Anxiety Disorder (F40.10) or Panic Disorder (F41.0).

Balancing these should offer a clear picture of his challenges.

**Deciding on primary diagnoses**

I'm considering the patient's situation, particularly how poor study management suggests ADHD but could also tie into anxiety and depression. Notably, he had greater support in high school, which makes his current struggles with academic performance indicative of a Specific Learning Disorder (SLD). 

For the top five diagnoses, my list is:

1. Specific Learning Disorder with impairment in reading and written expression (F81.0).
2. ADHD, combined presentation (F90.2).
3. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1) or Social Anxiety Disorder (F40.10).
4. Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood (F43.23) or Major Depressive Disorder (F32.1).
5. I'd consider including Panic Disorder (F41.0) or another anxiety disorder. 

Ultimately, the interplay among these conditions points to the complexity of his challenges.

**Compiling diagnoses**

I need to create a structured list of diagnoses based on the clinical vignette, focusing on DSM-5 terminology. I'm looking at Specific Learning Disorder with impairment in reading and written expression, ADHD (combined presentation), and Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood. Social Anxiety Disorder is also included, along with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. My final top five diagnoses are:

1. Specific Learning Disorder, with impairment in reading and written expression - F81.0  
2. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, combined presentation - F90.2  
3. Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood - F43.23  
4. Social Anxiety Disorder - F40.10  
5. Other specified anxiety disorder (panic attacks) - F41.8  

This structured list captures the relevant concerns effectively.

**Establishing diagnoses**

The new evaluation considers mood, anxiety symptoms, and other factors, confirming learning difficulties. I’m thinking the diagnostic list should include ADHD, Specific Learning Disorder with impairment in reading and writing, possibly Generalized Anxiety Disorder or Adjustment Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder or Unspecified Depressive Disorder, and Social Anxiety Disorder or Panic Attacks. 

I’ll prioritize Specific Learning Disorder as it’s confirmed and central to academic issues. Here’s my proposed list:

1. Specific Learning Disorder with impairment in reading and written expression - F81.0  
2. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, combined presentation - F90.2  
3. Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood - F43.23  
4. Social Anxiety Disorder - F40.10  
5. Other specified anxiety disorder (recurrent panic attacks) - F41.8

**Choosing primary diagnoses**

I'm considering whether social anxiety might explain panic attacks, but if they are separate, then they could qualify. I’m looking at options for a fifth diagnosis, like ""Other specified depressive disorder"" or ""Major depressive disorder."" We need to avoid unsupported diagnoses but have to list five. 

I think about including panic attacks linked to culture or separation anxiety, but the symptoms seem fluctuating. Given all this, I think ""Major depressive disorder, single episode"" fits as the fifth diagnosis. Thus, the five might be:

1. Specific Learning Disorder with impairment in reading and written expression
2. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, combined presentation
3. Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood 
4. Social Anxiety Disorder
5. Major Depressive Disorder, single episode

**Determining DSM-5-TR diagnoses**

I need to provide a structured list of top psychiatric diagnoses, which requires ranking them as differentials. The top five must consist of a primary diagnosis and four secondary diagnoses according to DSM-5-TR. I believe the primary diagnosis can be ""Specific Learning Disorder"" due to confirmed testing. I'll include ""ADHD,"" ""Social Anxiety Disorder,"" ""Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood,"" and ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder"" or ""Major Depressive Disorder"" as secondary. Panic disorder could also be a candidate due to past panic attacks linked to social situations. 

So this gives us:

1. Specific Learning Disorder with impairment (F81.0)
2. ADHD, combined presentation (F90.2)
3. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1)
4. Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, moderate (F32.1)
5. Social Anxiety Disorder (F40.10)

**Ranking Psychiatric Diagnoses**

I need to finalize a list of top psychiatric diagnoses based on the case details. The primary diagnosis can be ""Specific Learning Disorder"" (F81.0), followed by ""ADHD"" (F90.2). For the anxiety-related issues, I'm considering ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder"" (F41.1) and ""Social Anxiety Disorder"" (F40.10).

I might also include ""Major Depressive Disorder"" (F32.9) or ""Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood"" (F43.23) as the fifth option. Assessing their prominence, I'd lean towards GAD or Adjustment as primary due to the patient’s identified worries and stressors. 

So the final list could look like this:

1. Specific Learning Disorder - F81.0
2. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity Disorder - F90.2
3. Generalized Anxiety Disorder - F41.1
4. Social Anxiety Disorder - F40.10
5. Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood - F43.23

**Finalizing Diagnoses List**

I think I need to determine the top psychiatric diagnoses based on the specifics of the case. I’m leaning towards ""Specific Learning Disorder"" (F81.0) as the primary diagnosis. Then I want to include ""ADHD"" (F90.2) next, followed by ""Social Anxiety Disorder"" (F40.10). After that, I’m considering ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder"" (F41.1) due to his chronic worry. Finally, I might include ""Other Specified Depressive Disorder"" (F32.8) as the fifth option. 

This combination feels plausible and reflects his symptoms well, so let's finalize that list!

**Finalizing Diagnosis List**

I’m putting together the final list of diagnoses. The primary diagnosis is ""Specific Learning Disorder"" (F81.0). For the secondary diagnoses, I’m including ""ADHD, Combined Presentation"" (F90.2), ""Social Anxiety Disorder"" (F40.10), ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder"" (F41.1), and ""Other Specified Depressive Disorder"" (F32.8). Each item is carefully chosen based on the symptoms presented, ensuring clarity and accuracy in the coding here. Let’s finalize this list!

**Reviewing Case for Diagnoses**

I’m reassessing Carlos's case to ensure I capture all relevant details accurately. He’s a 19-year-old college freshman facing academic difficulties, anxiety, insomnia, and feelings of hopelessness. Diagnosed with ADHD at age 9, he has a history of educational struggles. Symptoms like nervousness, social anxiety, and depressive feelings may suggest multiple anxiety disorders or an adjustment disorder. I aim to finalize the diagnoses list, focusing on specific learning disorder, ADHD, social anxiety, generalized anxiety, and possibly an adjustment disorder. Let's finalize this thoughtfully.

**Finalizing Anxiety and Mood Diagnoses**

I’m sorting through the possible diagnoses for the case, specifically looking at social anxiety disorder, adjustment disorders, and generalized anxiety. The patient exhibits panic episodes and chronic worry, primarily about academic performance. While ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" or ""panic disorder"" might fit, I think ""Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood"" captures his symptoms better. Given the context, I’m leaning toward a final list that includes specific learning disorder, ADHD, social anxiety disorder, adjustment disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder as possible considerations.

**Assessing Anxiety and Mood Diagnoses**

I'm analyzing the case for possible diagnoses, particularly focusing on social anxiety, generalized anxiety, and adjustment disorders. The anxiety appears to be linked to academic performance challenges, not generalized anxiety as previously thought. It's essential to capture situational aspects, possibly opting for adjustment disorder or social anxiety instead. After weighing the symptoms and historical context, I’m considering specific learning disorder, ADHD, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder as my top five diagnoses.

**Determining Likely Diagnoses**

I'm considering whether the patient meets criteria for social anxiety, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and other mood disorders. The assessment shows a range of anxiety around school performance and social situations, with symptoms indicating both social anxiety and GAD. Given the complexities, I’m listing specific learning disorder, ADHD, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and other specified depressive disorder as the top five most likely diagnoses. I believe the evidence leans slightly more toward GAD given the chronic worry and related symptoms.

**Finalizing Diagnoses and Codes**

I'm finalizing the list of five diagnoses with their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes. I believe these are solid choices: 

1. Specific learning disorder with impairment in reading and written expression - F81.0  
2. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, combined presentation - F90.2  
3. Generalized anxiety disorder - F41.1  
4. Social anxiety disorder (social phobia) - F40.10  
5. Other specified depressive disorder - F32.8  

I’m weighing the options carefully, including possibilities like panic disorder, but this list feels most fitting based on the observed symptoms and diagnostic criteria.

**Finalizing Diagnoses Considerations**

I'm thinking about the possibility that his symptoms could fit under ""Major depressive disorder, single episode"" instead of ""other specified."" However, I'm leaning towards ""other specified"" because he may not fully meet the criteria. The mention of ""hopelessness"" does raise concerns. I also realize that ""Specific learning disorder"" counts as an F81 code, which is neurodevelopmental but recognized in mental disorders. Overall, I'm ready to finalize the diagnoses list based on these considerations.","1. Specific learning disorder, with impairment in reading and written expression - F81.0

83,"Daphne, a 13-year-old in the ninth grade, was brought for a psychiatric evaluation because of academic and behavioral struggles. She had particular difficulty starting and completing schoolwork and following instructions, and she had received failing grades in math. When prompted to complete tasks, Daphne became argumentative and irritable. She had become increasingly resistant to attending school, asking to stay home with her mother. These difficulties had been evident since early childhood but had worsened significantly this year. Because Daphne had become increasingly distressed, her parents have been less insistent on making her do any activity that upsets her.

Psychological testing indicated that Daphne had above-average intelligence, age-appropriate achievement in all subjects except math, and some difficulties in visuospatial skills. The test results were shared with the school, which offered additional tutoring. Daphne attended only a few sessions, stating that they were not helpful. Her parents talked to the school counselors and Daphne’s teachers, asking for more services. They were told repeatedly that Daphne needed to be more assertive and ask for help. Several teachers commented that Daphne should be more motivated and try harder. Several years earlier, her pediatrician had diagnosed ADHD and prescribed a stimulant. She took the medication for a week, but her parents stopped giving it to her because she seemed agitated.

At home, Daphne’s parents’ close supervision of her homework often led to arguments with crying and screaming. Her behavior and attitude were noticeably better when she was out of school. She had two long-standing friends but had made no new close friends for several years. In groups with other children, she preferred to play with those younger than she. When her friends chose the activity or did not follow her rules, she tended to withdraw. She was generally quiet in groups and in school but more interactive with family members and individuals she knew well.

Since early childhood, Daphne has had difficulty falling asleep, requiring a nightlight and parental reassurance. Recognizing that Daphne was easily upset by change, her parents rarely forced her into new activities. She did well during the summer, which she spent with her grandparents. Her parents reported no particular traumas, stressors, or developmental or medical problems. Daphne had started her menses about 2 months prior to the evaluation. Her family history was pertinent for multiple first- and second-degree relatives with mood, anxiety, or learning disorders.

At first meeting, Daphne was shy and tense. Her eye contact was poor, and she had difficulty talking about anything other than her plastic horse collection. Within 15 minutes, she became more comfortable, revealing that she disliked school because the work was too hard. She thought that other children did not seem to like her because she was stupid and was not into clothes and dating. Sometimes they made fun of her and would start laughing whenever the teacher called on her. There were several peers who had similar interests in animals and seemed okay. She has been eating lunch with them but found it hard to relax and to believe that they really wanted to be friends. Daphne was always afraid of making mistakes, getting bad grades, and disappointing everyone. Often, she was so preoccupied with what to say or do next that she did not pay attention to her peers or teachers. She frequently was unable to make a decision for fear of not being right. Daphne was unable to identify any personal strengths or any aspect of her life that was going well. She wished she had more friends and that she was smarter. As long as she could remember, she had always felt this way. These difficulties made her sad, but she denied persistent depressive feelings or suicidal thoughts. She appeared anxious but brightened when discussing her horse figurine collection, her longtime friends, and her family.","1. Specific learning disorder (mathematics)
2. Generalized anxiety disorder",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Analyzing the vignette**

I'm breaking down the vignette systematically to catch all the details. The subject is a 13-year-old in ninth grade who faces academic and behavioral challenges, especially with starting and completing work and struggling in math. There’s noticeable irritability and resistance to attending school, likely tied to longstanding difficulties that peaked this year due to increased academic pressure. Despite being diagnosed with ADHD and having above-average intelligence, support services like tutoring haven't been effective. Parents have been less insistent lately as the situation has become distressing.

**Evaluating home and social dynamics**

I’m analyzing the home environment where close supervision during homework leads to arguments and emotional distress. The child generally behaves better outside of school and has lasting friendships but hasn't formed new close connections in years. Preferring to interact with younger kids, she becomes withdrawn when friends don’t follow her rules. She’s quiet in groups but more engaged with family. Since childhood, she has had sleep issues and is easily upset by change, though she thrived with her grandparents. Family history shows mood and learning disorders, but no major stressors or medical issues are noted.

**Assessing meeting behavior**

During the meeting, the subject appears shy and tense, struggling with eye contact and engaging in conversation beyond her interest in plastic horses. After about 15 minutes, she warms up a bit. She dislikes school, feeling overworked and believing others think she’s stupid for not being into clothes or dating. Though she shares lunch with peers who enjoy animals, she finds it hard to feel accepted. She fears mistakes and disappointing others, often preoccupied with how to respond, which affects her focus and confidence.

**Exploring emotional and behavioral observations**

The subject shows sadness due to her difficulties but denies chronic depressive feelings or suicidal thoughts. She appears anxious but becomes more animated when discussing horse figurines, friends, and family, which hints at underlying low self-esteem and anxiety. While she may have traits suggestive of avoidant personality disorder, it’s too early for a formal diagnosis. I’m considering that she might struggle with social pragmatic communication as well as nonverbal learning challenges, alongside the pressures of adolescence exacerbating her situation. I need to rank her potential diagnoses.

**Ranking potential diagnoses**

The subject experiences significant fear of negative evaluation and an inability to relax around peers, indicating social anxiety. She also displays performance anxiety and potentially generalized anxiety with perfectionistic tendencies. There's a strong indication of a specific learning disorder in mathematics due to testing failures. 

I’m considering a structured list of the top five most likely psychiatric diagnoses based on the vignette’s details. Autism Spectrum Disorder should rank first, given various signs. Social Anxiety Disorder and Specific Learning Disorder can follow. I need to evaluate separation anxiety and generalized anxiety as well, given her worries and behaviors around school and performance.

**Finalizing diagnosis rankings**

The subject shows resistance to school, seeks parental reassurance, and has symptoms that may suggest separation anxiety. But her positive experiences with grandparents indicate she could separate from parents without issue. There are behaviors of oppositional defiant disorder, but they don't consistently appear across contexts. ADHD is possible, although she is generally quiet and may not display typical symptoms. 

Her chronic low self-esteem hints at potential depression, yet she doesn’t identify with persistent depressive feelings. I’m settling on the top five probable diagnoses: Autism Spectrum Disorder as the primary diagnosis, followed by Social Anxiety Disorder, Specific Learning Disorder with impairment in mathematics, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, predominantly inattentive type. I've ensured all the corresponding ICD-10 codes are accurate.

1. Autism Spectrum Disorder - F84.0  
2. Social Anxiety Disorder - F40.10

85,"Felicia Allen was a 32-year-old single woman brought to the emergency room (ER) by police after she apparently tried to steal a city bus in Chicago. Because she appeared to be an “emotionally disturbed person,” a psychiatry consultation was requested.

According to the police report, Ms. Allen threatened the driver with a knife, took control of the almost empty city bus, and crashed it. A more complete story was elicited from a friend of Ms. Allen’s who had been on the bus but who had not been arrested. According to her, they had boarded the bus on their way to a nearby shopping mall. Ms. Allen became frustrated when the driver refused her dollar bills, instead demanding exact change. She looked in her purse, but instead of finding exact change, she pulled out a kitchen knife that she carried for protection. The driver fled, so she got into the empty seat and drove the bus across the street into a nearby parked car.

On examination, Ms. Allen was a handcuffed, heavyset young woman with a bandage on her forehead. She fidgeted and rocked back and forth in her chair. She appeared to be mumbling to herself. When asked what she was saying, the patient made momentary eye contact and just repeated, “Sorry, sorry.” She did not respond to other questions.

More information was elicited from a psychiatrist who had come to the ER soon after the accident. He said that Ms. Allen and her friend were longtime residents at the state psychiatric hospital where he worked. They had just begun to take passes every week as part of an effort toward social remediation; it had been Ms. Allen’s first bus ride without a staff member.

According to the psychiatrist, Ms. Allen had received a diagnosis of “childhood-onset, treatment-resistant paranoid schizophrenia.” She had started hearing voices by age 5 years. Big, strong, intrusive, and psychotic, she had been hospitalized almost constantly since age 11. Her auditory hallucinations generally consisted of a critical voice commenting on her behavior. Her thinking was concrete, but when relaxed she could be self-reflective. She was motivated to please and recurrently said her biggest goal was to “have my own room in my own house with my own friends.” The psychiatrist said that he was not sure what had caused her to pull out the knife. She had not been hallucinating lately and had been feeling less paranoid, but he wondered if she had been more psychotic than she had let on. It was possible that she was just impatient and irritated. The psychiatrist also believed that she had spent almost no period of life developing normally and so had very little experience with the real world.

Ms. Allen had been taking clozapine for 1 year, with good resolution of her auditory hallucinations. She had gained 35 pounds on the clozapine, but she had less trouble getting out of bed in the morning and was functioning at a higher level. She was hoping to get a job and live more independently, and the bus trip had been intended as a step in that direction. Because of these improvements and goals, she had insisted on continuing to take the clozapine despite the weight gain.","Schizophrenia, multiple episodes, currently in acute episode",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Determining diagnoses**

I need to select plausible diagnoses that are well-supported. Schizophrenia is definitely the primary diagnosis. For potential secondary diagnoses, I’m considering catatonia associated with another mental disorder, but I'm uncertain about catatonic symptoms. 

Unspecified anxiety disorder seems plausible as she fidgets and rocks—maybe anxiety is present, but not strongly enough. 

Then there's intermittent explosive disorder due to the aggressive outburst with a knife, but it seems more related to schizophrenia or stress without a history of recurrent outbursts.

**Choosing additional diagnoses**

I’m considering adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct, but it requires specific emotional or behavioral symptoms within three months that don't apply here, especially since schizophrenia is already present. 

I think I should list ""Schizophrenia, acute exacerbation"" as the primary. For secondary diagnoses, ""Unspecified psychotic disorder"" won't work. We need four more diagnoses based on the given information, though we might not have enough evidence for five. However, I have to choose plausible options without making anything up, based on the details in the vignette.

**Analyzing the data**

I need to parse the details carefully about this individual. She’s described as ""big, strong, intrusive, and psychotic,"" with a history of chronic hospitalizations. 

She experiences auditory hallucinations and shows paranoid features. While her thinking is concrete, she can self-reflect. Her motivations include wanting her own space, which is a positive goal. 

After a year on clozapine, her hallucinations have improved, and she’s gained weight but is functioning better. 

Currently, her behaviors like fidgeting and rocking suggest either psychosis or disorganized behavior. Catatonia seems unlikely since she’s not immobile, but her muteness is concerning.

**Assessing current conditions**

She's in handcuffs and might be frightened. This situation could suggest an acute psychotic episode or an exacerbation of schizophrenia. 

There’s also a possibility of ""postictal confusion,"" but it seems less likely. The mention of her having passes weekly for social remediation indicates she's in a psychiatric hospital and may have legal status, which points to schizophrenia as the primary diagnosis. 

For other possible diagnoses, I’m thinking about ""other specified schizophrenia spectrum disorder,"" but it doesn’t entirely fit. ""Schizophrenia, residual state"" could be relevant since her hallucinations have resolved but there are still negative symptoms and cognitive deficits. However, I need to consider the DSM-5-TR requirements.

**Evaluating mental status and diagnoses**

I need to carefully evaluate the mental status exam. The individual is fidgeting, rocking, and mumbling ""Sorry, sorry,"" which may indicate acute psychosis, anxiety, or catatonia. 

Her mutism and stereotypy suggest possible catatonia, but I'm not sure if that’s due to cognitive impairment. Plus, she displayed aggressive behavior during the bus incident with a knife, pointing to potential paranoia or impulsive behavior. 

I’m thinking about potential diagnoses, with schizophrenia as the primary one, then considering catatonia, autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, and maybe intermittent explosive disorder, though I’m unsure about the last one.

**Analyzing diagnosis candidates**

I'm reviewing potential diagnoses for the individual. Candidate 2, catatonia associated with another mental disorder like schizophrenia, seems plausible given her symptoms. As for unspecified intellectual disability, there’s not enough strong evidence, but her concrete thinking and limited experience raise some concerns. Autism spectrum disorder appears possible too, although hallucinations complicate this.

When it comes to unspecified anxiety, the fidgeting isn't conclusive. I considered various possibilities for the bus incident, including impulsive control issues, but I need to carefully select the top diagnoses supported by evidence. Schizophrenia will be primary, and I'm hoping to derive four more plausible options to meet the criteria.

**Evaluating secondary diagnoses**

Given her long-term institutionalization, she may not fit the criteria for ""institutional syndrome,"" but I need to focus on plausible diagnoses. The primary diagnosis will definitely be schizophrenia.

For secondary diagnoses, I have a few contenders to consider, like catatonia associated with schizophrenia due to relevant symptoms. Others that could be listed include autism spectrum disorder and unspecified intellectual disability, but I'm less confident about those. I also thought about conditions like intermittent explosive disorder for her aggression during the bus incident. 

Narrowing down to the top five likely diagnoses is important. I should focus on schizophrenia and notable comorbidities or relevant conditions to create a solid set.

**Finalizing secondary diagnoses**

I’m considering the likelihood of secondary diagnoses. Autism spectrum disorder might apply due to symptoms like early onset and limited eye contact, but I’m not confident. Then there’s intellectual disability, which could fit but lacks strong evidence. I’m weighing impulse-control disorders for her aggressive behavior, yet still unsure. 

Ultimately, the top five likely diagnoses might include schizophrenia, catatonia associated with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. We need to ensure they align with DSM-5 guidelines without overlapping.

**Considering potential diagnoses**

I’m weighing the possibilities for secondary diagnoses. There's schizophrenia, and I could also think about catatonia related to it. Brief psychotic disorder and acute stress disorder might fit, though the substance-induced option is more speculative due to unclear substance use history.  

I have to focus on psychiatric diagnoses, so including something like delirium is tricky without clear evidence. My top five diagnoses might include schizophrenia, catatonia associated with schizophrenia, unspecified anxiety disorder, disruptive impulse-control disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. I want to make sure they’re reasonable and compatible!

**Finalizing psychiatric diagnoses**

To capture catatonia, I can add F06.1 as a specifier. Given the request to provide DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses, I should list schizophrenia instead of outdated terms. For the top five, I’m considering:

1. Schizophrenia - F20.9
2. Catatonia associated with another mental disorder (schizophrenia) - F06.1
3. Unspecified disruptive, impulse-control disorder - F91.9
4. Autism spectrum disorder - F84.0
5. Intellectual disability, unspecified - F79

However, I'm contemplating better alternatives for secondary disorders based on possible behavior and context, while ensuring they fit the vignette provided.

**Determining psychiatric diagnoses**

Based on the mention of ""childhood-onset, treatment-resistant paranoid schizophrenia,"" I'm leaning towards a primary diagnosis of schizophrenia. The ER presentation, including fidgeting and mumbling, suggests possible catatonia or an acute stress reaction, especially given the context of an arrest. For secondary diagnoses, I might consider ""acute stress disorder"" (F43.0), ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" (F41.9), ""Catatonia associated with schizophrenia"" (F06.1), and ""Other specified disruptive, impulse-control disorder"" (F91.8). Still, I need to finalize this list while ensuring the diagnoses align with her symptoms.

**Identifying potential diagnoses**

I'm looking into possible diagnoses based on behaviors like fidgeting, rocking, and repeating ""Sorry."" I’m considering ""unspecified anxiety disorder"" or ""obsessive-compulsive disorder,"" but those might not fit. There’s a chance of ""stereotypic movement disorder"" due to rocking, though that feels unusual. The case also discusses early-onset schizophrenia, which could indicate developmental issues or cognitive deficits. For a final list, I’m thinking:

1. Schizophrenia - F20.9
2. Catatonia associated with another mental disorder - F06.1
3. Intellectual disability, unspecified - F79
4. Autism spectrum disorder - F84.0
5. Unspecified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder - F91.9

But I need to verify some details for accuracy.

**Determining diagnoses post-incident**

I’m trying to finalize a top-five list of potential diagnoses based on the context. The clear primary diagnosis is schizophrenia (F20.9), and I’m leaning towards including catatonia associated with another mental disorder (F06.1) and possibly unspecified anxiety disorder (F41.9). Given the recent traumatic incident, I see the potential for acute stress disorder (F43.0) and delirium due to head injury (F05) as viable options. 

1. Schizophrenia - F20.9
2. Catatonia - F06.1
3. Delirium - F05
4. Acute stress disorder - F43.0
5. Unspecified anxiety disorder - F41.9

I need to ensure the selected diagnoses reflect the current mental state accurately.

**Evaluating psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm exploring potential diagnostic codes, focusing on F05 for delirium, F43.0 for acute stress disorder, and F41.9 for unspecified anxiety disorder. Given the user's criteria for top diagnoses, I’m considering schizophrenia (F20.9) and catatonia (F06.1), but both can overlap. The clear primary diagnosis is schizophrenia, and secondary diagnoses might include catatonia, acute stress disorder, and unspecified anxiety. 

1. Schizophrenia - F20.9  
2. Catatonia - F06.1  
3. Unspecified anxiety disorder - F41.9  
4. Delirium - F05  
5. Acute stress disorder - F43.0  

I'm trying to choose the most plausible options based on the user's situation.

**Structuring psychiatric diagnoses**

I need to provide a list of psychiatric diagnoses based on the clinical vignette. The primary diagnosis could be schizophrenia (F20.9), followed by catatonia (F06.1). For the top five, I’m considering including delirium due to head injury (F05), acute stress disorder (F43.0), and possibly unspecified anxiety disorder (F41.9) or intellectual disability (F79). It's tricky because there’s overlap between conditions, but prioritizing the most likely ones is essential. 

So the refined list is:  
1. Schizophrenia - F20.9  
2. Catatonia - F06.1  
3. Delirium - F05  
4. Acute stress disorder - F43.0  
5. Unspecified anxiety disorder - F41.9

**Refining psychiatric diagnoses**

I’m evaluating potential diagnoses: I think schizophrenia (F20.9), catatonia (F06.1), delirium (F05), acute stress disorder (F43.0), and unspecified anxiety disorder (F41.9) are plausible. Schizophrenia is strong, while the others are possible given the symptoms. 

Including acute stress or unspecified trauma-related disorders can be justified since they capture immediate reactions. I'm leaning toward a final list like this:  
1. Schizophrenia - F20.9  
2. Catatonia - F06.1  
3. Delirium - F05  
4. Acute stress disorder - F43.0  
5. Unspecified anxiety disorder - F41.9

**Crafting the psychiatric diagnosis list**

I'm considering the appropriate diagnoses to include. My initial thoughts are schizophrenia (F20.9), catatonia (F06.1), and perhaps unspecified psychotic disorder (F29) or delusional disorder (F22). However, it seems redundant to include too many variations.

Focusing on the top five likely diagnoses, I think the final list should look like this:  
1. Schizophrenia - F20.9  
2. Catatonia associated with another mental disorder - F06.1  
3. Delirium due to known physiological condition - F05  
4. Unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder - F43.9  
5. Unspecified anxiety disorder - F41.9  

This combination seems plausible while adhering to the instructions given.

**Evaluating differential diagnoses**

I'm considering including various diagnoses. Initially, I think ""Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition"" could be viable, but let’s focus on more common differentials for a chronic psychotic patient with violent behavior.

1. Schizophrenia - F20.9  
2. Catatonia associated with another mental disorder (schizophrenia) - F06.1  
3. Delirium due to known physiological condition - F05  
4. Unspecified neurodevelopmental disorder - F89  
5. Unspecified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder - F91.9  

This list captures the symptoms without getting too speculative, focusing on the most likely diagnoses.

**Identifying potential diagnoses**

I’m reflecting on how the phrase ""thinking was concrete"" might hint at cognitive deficits, but not necessarily. The psychiatrist's remark about self-reflection suggests cognitive capacity, so avoiding intellectual disability might be wise. 

Considering the evidence I have, I’ll finalize the following differential diagnoses: 

1. Schizophrenia - F20.9  
2. Catatonia associated with another mental disorder - F06.1  
3. Delirium due to known physiological condition - F05  
4. Unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder - F43.9  
5. Other specified schizophrenia spectrum or psychotic disorder - F28  

These diagnoses seem plausible given the case context.

**Finalizing potential diagnoses**

I'm working through a list of possible diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms. I need to consider:

1. Schizophrenia - F20.9  
2. Catatonia associated with another mental disorder (schizophrenia) - F06.1  
3. Delirium due to known physiological condition - F05  
4. Unspecified dissociative disorder - F44.9  
5. Intellectual disability, unspecified severity - F79  

It's tricky since I have to discern between various conditions like dissociative states or autism spectrum disorders. However, given the complexity, I need to keep the criteria straightforward and adhere to the leading symptoms of schizophrenia and related conditions.

**Crafting diagnosis list**

I'm working through a diagnosis list and considering various options. Right now, I'm leaning towards:  

1. Schizophrenia - F20.9  
2. Catatonia associated with another mental disorder (schizophrenia) - F06.1  
3. Delirium due to known physiological condition - F05  
4. Autism spectrum disorder - F84.0  
5. Unspecified anxiety disorder - F41.9  

I think this list captures the necessary distinctions, considering both acute and chronic conditions. It's quite a balancing act to make sure I'm selecting the most relevant diagnoses based on the information I have!

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

I'm reviewing potential diagnoses and considering the importance of each. I think the final list should include:

1. Schizophrenia - F20.9  
2. Catatonia associated with another mental disorder (schizophrenia) - F06.1  
3. Delirium due to known physiological condition - F05  
4. Autism spectrum disorder - F84.0  
5. Unspecified neurodevelopmental disorder - F89  

This selection captures both chronic and acute conditions while acknowledging her developmental context. It seems necessary to focus on a structured list that adheres to DSM-5 standards without over-speculating on her conditions. This feels like a solid plan!

**Verifying diagnosis codes**

Before finalizing, I'm double-checking that the codes align with the diagnoses:

1. Schizophrenia - F20.9  
2. Catatonia associated with another mental disorder - F06.1  
3. Delirium due to known physiological condition - F05  
4. Autism spectrum disorder - F84.0  
5. Intellectual disability, unspecified severity - F79  

These codes are correct and formatted properly for ICD-10 without needing any extra identifiers. I think I'm ready to deliver this final output!","1. Schizophrenia - F20.9

86,"Gregory Baker was a 20-year-old African American man who was brought to the emergency room (ER) by the campus police of the university from which he had been suspended several months earlier. The police had been called by a professor who reported that Mr. Baker had walked into his classroom shouting, “I am the Joker, and I am looking for Batman.” When Mr. Baker refused to leave the class, the professor contacted security.

Although Mr. Baker had much academic success as a teenager, his behavior had become increasingly odd during the past year. He quit seeing his friends and spent most of his time lying in bed staring at the ceiling. He lived with several family members but rarely spoke to any of them. He had been suspended from college because of lack of attendance. His sister said that she had recurrently seen him mumbling quietly to himself and noted that he would sometimes, at night, stand on the roof of their home and wave his arms as if he were “conducting a symphony.” He denied having any intention of jumping from the roof or having any thoughts of self-harm, but claimed that he felt liberated and in tune with the music when he was on the roof. Although his father and sister had tried to encourage him to see someone at the university’s student health clinic, Mr. Baker had never seen a psychiatrist and had no prior hospitalizations.

During the prior several months, Mr. Baker had become increasingly preoccupied with a female friend, Anne, who lived down the street. While he insisted to his family that they were engaged, Anne told Mr. Baker’s sister that they had hardly ever spoken and certainly were not dating. Mr. Baker’s sister also reported that he had written many letters to Anne but never mailed them; instead, they just accumulated on his desk.

His family said that they had never known him to use illicit substances or alcohol, and his toxicology screen was negative. When asked about drug use, Mr. Baker appeared angry and did not answer.

On examination in the ER, Mr. Baker was a well-groomed young man who was generally uncooperative. He appeared constricted, guarded, inattentive, and preoccupied. He became enraged when the ER staff brought him dinner. He loudly insisted that all of the hospital’s food was poisoned and that he would only drink a specific type of bottled water. He was noted to have paranoid, grandiose, and romantic delusions. He appeared to be internally preoccupied, although he denied hallucinations. Mr. Baker reported feeling “bad” but denied depression and did not show disturbances in his sleep or appetite. He was adequately oriented to person and place but less so to time. He spoke articulately but refused formal cognitive testing. His insight and judgment were deemed to be poor.

Mr. Baker’s grandmother had died in a state psychiatric hospital, where she had lived for 30 years. Her diagnosis was unknown. Mr. Baker’s mother was reportedly “crazy.” She had abandoned the family when Mr. Baker was young, and he was raised by his father and paternal grandmother.

Ultimately, Mr. Baker agreed to sign himself into the psychiatric unit, stating, “I don’t mind staying here. Anne will probably be there, so I can spend my time with her.”","Schizophrenia, first episode, currently in acute episode",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Structuring psychiatric diagnoses**

I need to provide a structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses, focusing on F-codes. Starting with unspecified psychosis (F29), which corresponds to ""Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder."" When considering the top five diagnoses likely associated with the case, I should highlight schizophrenia, schizotypal disorder, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, and bipolar with psychotic features. It seems the case suggests schizophrenia, with secondary options including schizoaffective disorder and delusional disorder. ""Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder"" could serve as a fallback.

**Listing psychiatric diagnoses**

I’m focusing on the top psychiatric diagnoses with their corresponding F-codes. The primary diagnosis is schizophrenia, coded as F20.9. Following that, I’ll list the four secondary diagnoses, which include: 

1. Schizophrenia - F20.9
2. Schizophreniform disorder - F20.81
3. Delusional disorder, erotomanic type - F22
4. Schizoaffective disorder, unspecified type - F25.9
5. Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder - F29

I’ll double-check to ensure all codes are correct!

**Analyzing schizoaffective disorder types**

I'm reviewing the coding for schizoaffective disorder. For the bipolar type, it’s coded F25.0, while depressive is F25.1, and the unspecified type is F25.9. I need to align with DSM-5-TR, so it may be best to specify either bipolar or depressive. However, given the symptom presentation, I can't confidently choose bipolar or depressive, so opting for F25.9, the unspecified type, might be prudent. There’s also the possibility of coding it as ""psychotic disorder due to another medical condition - F06.2,"" but that requires careful consideration.

**Determining potential diagnoses**

I'm trying to narrow down the differential diagnoses. No clear medical findings, so I’m considering options like paranoid personality disorder (F60.0) but decide against that. Instead, I focus on computing the top 5 likely diagnoses: schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, and bipolar I with psychotic features. Given the negative symptoms and absence of mania, bipolar seems less likely. Brief psychotic disorder may not apply due to duration. I wonder if cannabis-induced psychotic disorder could be relevant since it's common in younger individuals, but negative toxicology results complicate that.

**Listing potential diagnoses**

I’m narrowing down the top psychiatric diagnoses for this case. Based on the evaluation, the primary diagnosis is likely schizophrenia, coded F20.9. The top five diagnoses I'm considering are:

1. Schizophrenia - F20.9
2. Schizophreniform disorder - F20.81
3. Schizoaffective disorder, unspecified type - F25.9
4. Delusional disorder, erotomanic type - F22
5. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic with psychotic features - F31.2

I’ll double-check F31.2 to ensure it aligns with the symptoms described!

**Finalizing potential diagnoses**

I need to create a structured list of the top DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses for this case with corresponding ICD-10 F-codes. Based on the available information, the diagnoses I'm considering are:

1. Schizophrenia - F20.9
2. Schizophreniform disorder - F20.81
3. Schizoaffective disorder, unspecified type - F25.9
4. Delusional disorder, erotomanic type - F22
5. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic with psychotic features - F31.2

These seem to be the best choices based on the clinical details provided!

**Finalizing the list of diagnoses**

I need to create a structured list based on the diagnosis criteria. I’ve determined that for the primary diagnosis, “Schizophrenia” with F20.9 is appropriate. The secondary diagnoses should include:

1. Schizophrenia - F20.9
2. Schizophreniform disorder - F20.81
3. Schizoaffective disorder, unspecified type - F25.9
4. Delusional disorder, erotomanic type - F22
5. Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe with psychotic features - F32.3

I'll finalize this, as it aligns best with the available information!

**Refining differential diagnoses**

I'm sorting through the potential diagnoses based on the information available. It seems important to prioritize:

1. Schizophrenia - F20.9
2. Schizophreniform disorder - F20.81
3. Schizoaffective disorder - F25.9
4. Delusional disorder, erotomanic type - F22
5. Bipolar I disorder with psychotic features - F31.2

I’m considering the nuances of symptoms and duration, but since we have to focus on the five most likely options, I feel confident in this order. Each diagnosis aligns with what we've discussed.

**Finalizing differential diagnoses**

I’m considering including Bipolar I as a potential diagnosis despite the absence of clear mania since the patient's bizarre behavior could mimic it. However, I'll stick with the following top five diagnoses:

1. Schizophrenia - F20.9
2. Schizophreniform disorder - F20.81
3. Schizoaffective disorder, unspecified type - F25.9
4. Delusional disorder, erotomanic type - F22

87,"Hakim Coleman was a 25-year-old U.S. Army veteran turned community college student who presented to the emergency room (ER) with his girlfriend and sister. On examination, he was a tall, slim, and well-groomed young man with glasses. He spoke softly, with an increased latency of speech. His affect was blunted except when he became anxious while discussing his symptoms.

Mr. Coleman stated that he had come to the ER at his sister’s suggestion. He said he could use a “general checkup” because of several days of “migraines” and “hallucinations of a spiritual nature” that had persisted for 3 months. His headache involved “sharp, shooting” sensations in various bilateral locations in his head and a “ringing” sensation along the midline of his brain that seemed to worsen when he thought about his vices.

Mr. Coleman described his vices as being “alcohol, cigarettes, disrespecting my parents, girls.” He denied guilt, anxiety, or preoccupation with any of his military duties during his tour in Iraq, although his sister shared that Hakim’s military responsibilities were of a confidential nature. He had joined an evangelical church 4 months earlier in the context of being “riddled with guilt” about “all the things I’ve done.” Three months earlier, he began “hearing voices trying to make me feel guilty” most days. The last auditory hallucination had been the day before. During these past few months, he became withdrawn and noticed that strangers were commenting on his past sins.

Mr. Coleman believed that his migraines and guilt might be due to alcohol withdrawal. He had been drinking three or four cans of beer most days of the week for several years until he “quit” 4 months earlier after joining the church. He still drank “a beer or two” every other week but felt guilty afterward. He denied alcohol withdrawal symptoms such as tremor and sweats. He had smoked cannabis up to twice monthly for years but completely quit when he joined the church. He denied using other illicit drugs except for one uneventful use of cocaine 3 years earlier. He sometimes would sleep only a few hours and did report some nightmares. Otherwise, Mr. Coleman denied depressive, manic, or psychotic symptoms and violent ideation.

Regarding PTSD, Mr. Coleman’s score on the 20-item self-administered PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 was below the cutoff score (between 31 and 33 out of 80) that would indicate probable PTSD in veterans. He denied that his military experience was unusually or especially frightening, horrible, or traumatic. Regarding other stressors, he felt overwhelmed by his current responsibilities, which included attending school and near-daily church activities. He had been a straight-A student at the start of the school year but was now receiving Bs and Cs.

The patient’s girlfriend and sister were interviewed separately. They agreed that Mr. Coleman had become socially isolative and quiet, after having previously been fun and outgoing. He had also never been especially religious prior to this episode. His sister believed that Mr. Coleman had been “brainwashed” by the church. His girlfriend, however, had attended services with Mr. Coleman. She reported that several members of the congregation had told her they had occasionally talked to new members who felt guilt over their prior behaviors, but none who had ever hallucinated, and they were worried about him.

A physical examination of the patient, including a neurological screen, was unremarkable, as were routine laboratory testing, a blood alcohol level, and urine toxicology. A noncontrast head computed tomography (CT) scan was normal.",Schizophreniform disorder (provisional),dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Assessing psychotic disorders**

I'm considering mood disorders with psychotic features, which usually require prominent mood symptoms. Since those aren't present, schizoaffective disorder is less likely. Although substance-induced psychosis might be a concern due to cannabis and alcohol, the psychosis began after quitting, so that's less probable too. Medical exams returned normal, even with headaches. My top five considerations for diagnosis include: Schizophreniform disorder, schizophrenia, major depressive disorder with psychotic features, substance-induced psychotic disorder, and a psychotic disorder from another medical condition. It's a complex situation!

**Evaluating potential diagnoses**

I’m thinking about including ""Brief psychotic disorder,"" but it needs a duration of less than a month, and he says three months. I should check for signs of disorganized speech or thought blocking, but it doesn't seem sufficient. I considered ""Schizophrenia, paranoid type,"" though it’s not in DSM-5. Maybe ""Psychotic disorder not due to substance or physiological conditions"" fits—ICD-10 code F28 allows for that. I really want to ensure we stick to DSM-5 criteria while specifying diagnoses accurately!

**Clarifying potential diagnoses**

I’m noticing a nuance here: for a 25-year-old with three months of psychotic symptoms, I might think about ""Schizophrenia, first episode, currently in acute episode""—not technically a DSM-5 diagnosis but a specifier. Another point is his recent involvement with an evangelical church and experiences of guilt and voices, which might suggest a ""Religious or spiritual problem"" (Z65.8). I'm also considering other options like ""Schizo-obsessive"" due to reported migraines. I’ve got to focus on structuring a clear list of diagnoses with their F-codes instead.

**Determining appropriate diagnoses**

As a psychiatrist, I need to ensure I’m making correct DSM-5-TR diagnoses based on the available information. My primary consideration here is ""Schizophreniform disorder."" Yet, could this actually be ""Schizophrenia"" if the disturbance lasts longer than six months? The patient's involvement with a church four months ago and feelings of guilt suggest earlier symptoms, though not necessarily psychotic. His academic performance also declined rapidly, which is concerning. I'm leaning towards ""Schizophreniform,"" and for secondary diagnoses, I need to choose the top four, considering options like ""Delusional disorder, religious type,"" but that seems less applicable due to the hallucinations.

**Analyzing potential diagnoses**

I'm considering the nuances of delusional disorder, where hallucinations relate to the delusional theme, but in this case, the frequent voices leading to guilt seem prominent. This might indicate ""Schizophrenia"" as a possibility, or ""Unspecified psychotic disorder"" if there’s not enough supporting evidence. I assembled a list of potential diagnoses that includes ""Schizophreniform disorder,"" ""Schizophrenia,"" substance-induced conditions, and perhaps a psychotic disorder stemming from medical conditions. It’s complex, but I need to rank these based on likelihood for clarity and effective management.

I'm outlining the top five diagnoses for my analysis: Schizophreniform disorder, schizophrenia, substance-induced psychotic disorder, psychotic disorder due to a medical condition, and major depressive disorder with psychotic features. I'm confirming the correct ICD-10 codes, such as F20.81 for schizophreniform disorder and F20.9 for unspecified schizophrenia. For substance-induced conditions, I'm considering F10.159 for alcohol-induced psychotic disorder but need to verify. Lastly, I'm structuring an output list of these diagnoses with the appropriate codes, ensuring everything aligns with the DSM-5-TR.

I'm considering the symptoms and need to identify secondary diagnoses while remaining focused on psychosis. For my top five, I’ll include: Schizophreniform disorder (F20.81), schizophrenia (F20.9), psychotic disorder due to another medical condition (F06.2), substance-induced psychotic disorder (likely F10.159 for alcohol), and major depressive disorder with psychotic features (F32.3). I'm also checking the accuracy of these codes to ensure they align with DSM-5-TR criteria, especially for substance use, and keeping in mind the patient's history. It's a puzzle!

I’m recalling ICD-10 codes for alcohol-related disorders, particularly focusing on those like F10.15x, which covers alcohol-induced psychotic disorder. I’m considering using the code F10.959, representing unspecified alcohol use with psychotic disorder and hallucinations. I want to ensure I provide an accurate list without getting into reasoning, which means only offering the structured diagnoses. For my final list, I think I’ll include: Schizophreniform disorder (F20.81), schizophrenia (F20.9), major depressive disorder with psychotic features (F32.3), and alcohol-induced psychotic disorder (F10.959).

I think we should use the code ""Alcohol use, unspecified with alcohol-induced psychotic disorder with hallucinations"" F10.959. I'm verifying if this code exists, and it seems plausible based on my memory of the relevant codes. Additionally, I want to limit my list to five diagnoses. Here’s what I’m finalizing:

1. Schizophreniform disorder - F20.81  
2. Schizophrenia - F20.9  
3. Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe with psychotic features - F32.3

89,"John Evans was a 25-year-old single, unemployed white man who had been seeing a psychiatrist for several years for management of psychosis, depression, anxiety, and abuse of marijuana and alcohol.

After an apparently normal childhood, Mr. Evans began to show dysphoric mood, anhedonia, low energy, and social isolation by age 15 years. At about the same time, Mr. Evans began to drink alcohol and smoke marijuana every day. In addition, he developed recurrent panic attacks, marked by a sudden onset of palpitations, diaphoresis, and thoughts that he was going to die. When he was at his most depressed and panicky, he twice received a combination of sertraline 100 mg/day and psychotherapy. In both cases, his most intense depressive symptoms lifted within a few weeks, and he discontinued the sertraline after a few months. Between episodes of severe depression, he was generally seen as sad, irritable, and amotivated. His school performance declined around tenth grade and remained marginal throughout the rest of high school. He did not attend college as his parents had expected him to, but instead lived at home and did odd jobs in the neighborhood.

Around age 20, Mr. Evans developed a psychotic episode in which he had the conviction that he had murdered people when he was 6 years old. Although he could not remember who these people were or the circumstances, he was absolutely convinced that this had happened, something that was confirmed by continuous voices accusing him of being a murderer. He also became convinced that other people would punish him for what had happened, and thus he feared for his life. Over the ensuing few weeks, he became guilt-ridden and preoccupied with the idea that he should kill himself by slashing his wrists, which culminated in his being psychiatrically hospitalized.

Although he was predominantly anxious on admission, Mr. Evans soon became very depressed, with prominent anhedonia, poor sleep, and decreased appetite and concentration. With the combined use of antipsychotic and antidepressant medications, both the depression and the psychotic symptoms remitted after 4 weeks. Therefore, the total duration of the psychotic episode was approximately 7 weeks, 4 of which were also characterized by major depressive disorder. Mr. Evans had been hospitalized with the same pattern of symptoms two additional times before age 22, and each of these episodes started with several weeks of delusions and hallucinations related to his conviction that he had murdered someone when he was a child, followed by severe depression lasting an additional month. Both relapses occurred while he was apparently adherent to reasonable dosages of antipsychotic and antidepressant medications. During the 3 years prior to this evaluation, Mr. Evans had been adherent to clozapine and had been without hallucinations and delusions. He had also been adherent to his antidepressant medication and supportive psychotherapy, although his dysphoria, irritability, and amotivation never completely resolved.

Mr. Evans’s history was significant for marijuana and alcohol misuse that began at age 15. Before the onset of psychosis at age 20, he smoked several joints of marijuana almost daily and binge-drank on weekends, with occasional blackouts. After the onset of the psychosis, he decreased his marijuana and alcohol use significantly, with two several-month-long periods of abstinence, yet he continued to have psychotic episodes up through age 22. He started attending Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous groups, achieved sobriety from marijuana and alcohol at age 23, and had remained sober for the 2 years prior to this evaluation.","1. Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type
2. Alcohol use disorder, in remission
3. Cannabis use disorder, in remission",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Clarifying diagnoses**

They want a primary diagnosis and four secondary ones. I’m realizing I can’t list both schizoaffective and schizophrenia as primary—it wouldn’t make sense. Instead, I think I should interpret their request as needing the most likely primary diagnosis along with potential comorbidity options. So, I'll focus on plausible conditions, including psychotic disorders, depressive disorders, panic disorders, and substance use disorders like cannabis and alcohol, while ensuring I don’t just list differentials.

**Evaluating diagnostic criteria**

Okay, I’m looking at the possible primary diagnosis of schizoaffective depressive type, which would include major depressive disorder. So I can list cannabis and alcohol use disorders, panic disorder, and perhaps persistent depressive disorder as the five conditions. However, I'm questioning if persistent depressive disorder really applies. For panic disorder, I see recurrent panic attacks, but I'm not clear on whether there were unexpected triggers. The requirement mentions persistent concern or maladaptive behavior, but that isn’t described. I need to clarify this.

**Analyzing symptoms and diagnoses**

I’m thinking about whether ""panic attacks"" fit into an anxiety disorder or major depressive disorder (MDD). They mentioned recurrent panic attacks developed upon admission, but there’s no indication of generalized anxiety. I can include panic disorder, but I’m unsure about it. Also, there's social isolation and low energy, which could point to negative symptoms or depression. I see signs for severe cannabis and alcohol use disorders, especially since the user achieved sobriety and remained sober for two years. Major depressive disorder seems recurrent, too, with episodes occurring at 15 and again between 20-22.

**Assessing depressive disorders**

I’m considering the user’s symptoms—dysphoria, irritability, and amotivation—which might be mild. I think I can list ""Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in partial remission,"" but I can’t confirm the partial remission without clear duration details. Alternatively, ""Persistent Depressive Disorder"" with intermittent Major Depressive Episodes (MDE) could apply. He has chronic depressive symptoms, fitting the requirements for persistent depressive disorder if he's had them for most days over two years, along with symptoms like low energy and anhedonia. Overall, it seems likely he meets the criteria.

**Deciding on diagnoses**

I need to clarify the user's persistent symptoms. While there’s a history of dysphoria and irritability, I can't fully confirm a depressed mood for two years. Since dysphoria and irritability haven't resolved, it supports the idea of persistent depressive disorder. However, if schizophrenia is the primary condition, MDD could also be comorbid. 

I’m weighing five potential diagnoses: schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, major depressive disorder with psychotic features, substance-induced psychotic disorder, and delusional disorder. Given episodes of psychosis lasting over a month and overlapping mood episodes, schizophrenia seems most fitting. 

For ICD-10 codes, I can use F20.9 for unspecified schizophrenia and F33.41 for major depressive disorder, recurrent in partial remission. We should focus on these to create a structured list of diagnoses. I’ll be careful to specify secondary diagnoses without inaccurately attributing psychotic features to MDD.

**Finalizing psychiatric diagnoses**

I’m looking at the user’s history, particularly the two severe depression episodes at 15 and the onset of psychosis at 20. Since psychotic symptoms appeared first, schizophrenia seems to be the primary diagnosis. 

For the ICD-10 codes, I'll list F20.9 for schizophrenia, and for major depressive disorder, I’ll likely use F33.2, indicating recurrent, severe depression without psychotic features, since the psychosis aligns with schizophrenia. 

I’ll also include panic disorder (F41.0), cannabis use disorder in sustained remission (F12.21), and alcohol use disorder in sustained remission (F10.21). Time to wrap it all up!","1. Schizophrenia - F20.9

90,"Kevin Foster, a 32-year-old married white man with a history of bipolar disorder, was brought to the emergency room (ER) by police after his wife called 911 to report that he was threatening to jump out of their hotel window.

At the time of the episode, Mr. Foster and his wife were on vacation, celebrating their fifth anniversary. To commemorate the event, they decided to get tattoos. Afterward, they went to a nearby park, where Mr. Foster bought and smoked a marijuana cigarette. During the ensuing hour, Mr. Foster began to believe that the symbols in his tattoo had mysterious meaning and power. He became convinced that the tattoo artist was conspiring with others against him and that his wife was cheating on him. After returning to the hotel, the patient searched his wife’s phone for evidence of her infidelity and threatened to jump out the window. The patient’s wife, an ER physician, successfully convinced the patient to go to sleep, thinking that the episode would resolve.

The following day, the patient remained paranoid and delusional. He again threatened to jump out the window, and indicated that he would have no choice but to kill his wife the next time she slept. She called 911, and her husband was brought to the ER of a large nearby hospital. Later that day, he was admitted to an acute inpatient psychiatric unit with a diagnosis of unspecified psychotic disorder.

Mr. Foster had smoked cannabis sporadically from age 18 but began to smoke daily 5 years prior to this admission. In the past year, his cannabis use had steadily increased; previously he had been smoking once per day, but more recently his use had increased to three times a day, beginning when he awoke. He noted that he has begun to feel “anxious” when not under the influence of cannabis and believed his thrice-daily use helped him “even out.” The patient and his wife denied that he had ever used other illicit substances, and the patient indicated that he rarely drank alcohol. Until 1 year earlier, he had never seen a psychiatrist or been viewed by his friends and family as having significant psychiatric issues.

In the past year, however, Mr. Foster had been hospitalized four times for psychiatric problems. He had been hospitalized twice with classic manic symptoms and once for a suicidal depression. In addition, 7 months prior to this presentation, the patient had been hospitalized for a 6-week episode of cannabis-induced psychosis, which responded well to risperidone. At that time, his main symptom was paranoia. Two months prior to this admission, he entered a 1-month inpatient substance abuse treatment program for cannabis use disorder. Until the weekend of this admission, he had continued to smoke marijuana but had not used alcohol or any other substances since discharge from the rehabilitation facility. He had also been functioning well while taking lithium monotherapy for 3 months.

Mr. Foster had been steadily employed as a film editor since graduating from college. His father had a bipolar disorder, and his paternal grandfather committed suicide via gunshot but with an unknown diagnosis.

On the second day of hospitalization, Mr. Foster began to realize that his wife was not cheating on him and that the symbols in his tattoo were not meaningful. By the third day, he spontaneously said the paranoia was the result of cannabis intoxication. He declined further risperidone but continued lithium monotherapy. He was discharged with an appointment to follow up with his outpatient psychiatrist.","1. Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder

3. Cannabis use disorder, moderate",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Evaluating diagnostic codes**

For the DSM-5, the codes for substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder vary by substance. For cannabis-induced psychotic disorder, I'm unsure if the code is F12.159. For alcohol-induced psychotic disorder with delusions, I thought it might be F10.950. There are patterns to recall, but I'm debating general codes for cannabis. Substance-induced psychotic disorders include hallucinations and delusions with certain specifiers, but I think the code for cannabis-induced might be F12.150 for those with delusions, F12.151 for hallucinations, and F12.159 as unspecified.

**Clarifying diagnostic codes**

I'm figuring out the codes for substance-induced psychotic disorders. For ""alcohol-induced psychotic disorder with delusions,"" I think it’s F10.950 and with hallucinations is F10.951, while the unspecified is F10.959. I’m double-checking the cannabis codes too: F12.1xx indicates cannabis abuse or unspecified use, where F12.120 is for uncomplicated abuse and F12.129 includes intoxication. For dependence, F12.220 applies, and for unspecified use, it’s F12.920. This pattern helps me remember the details!

**Refining code selection**

For cannabis-induced psychotic disorder, it's essential to specify whether it's about abuse, dependence, or unspecified cases, along with any related psychotic disorder. The DSM-5 may just reference F12.959 for general cases, but I think we should consider the dependence aspect as well. For example, I recall F12.250 for cannabis dependence. Meanwhile, for alcohol, F10.25x codes denote inclusion of psychotic disorders. Hence, for cannabis dependence with psychotic disorder, it could be F12.250 for delusions and F12.251 for hallucinations. I need to confirm that.

**Mapping diagnostic codes**

I'm trying to clarify the coding for cannabis-induced psychotic disorder. The DSM-5 uses codes like F12.159, but I think it might be clearer to use F12.25 for dependence with psychotic disorder. Looking more closely, F12.2 covers cannabis dependence, with various subcodes indicating specific conditions: F12.20 for uncomplicated dependence, F12.21 for remission, and F12.25 for dependence with psychotic disorder. For comparison, I recall similar subcodes for alcohol dependence, such as F10.25 for alcohol-induced psychotic disorder.

**Evaluating diagnosis and codes**

For diagnosing cannabis-induced psychotic disorder, I’m considering different codes. It looks like F12.250 could apply for dependence with delusions. I notice similar coding exists for alcohol-related disorders, which informs my understanding. We also have to factor in the diagnostics for cannabis use disorder, potentially severe, corresponding to F12.20. While I know there's a distinction, it feels appropriate to list several diagnoses, while being cautious to avoid redundancy and ensure clarity in my coding, especially regarding bipolar disorder and mood-related conditions.

**Determining possible diagnoses**

I'm considering various diagnoses for this case, starting with ""Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder"" as primary, alongside ""Bipolar I disorder"" and ""Cannabis use disorder, severe."" I'm trying to find additional diagnoses, but many possibilities seem less fitting or redundant. For example, ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" might not apply since he has a history of suicidal depression as part of bipolar disorder. I’m also weighing options like anxiety and withdrawal disorders but struggling to find strong candidates. Overall, I aim to create a structured list of top five likely diagnoses, focusing on those that clearly align with the evaluations seen in the vignette.

**Analyzing top diagnoses**

I'm trying to parse through the possible diagnoses for this case, prioritizing the top five most likely according to the user's instructions. I’m considering ""Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder"" and ""Cannabis use disorder."" Bipolar I disorder seems plausible too, but I have to confirm that mania isn't solely due to cannabis use. Other options include ""Cannabis-induced anxiety disorder"" or various psychotic disorders, but I need to be careful about redundancy. I want to ensure I'm sticking to DSM-5-TR and using proper coding while listing these diagnoses clearly and effectively for the user.

**Verifying ICD-10 codes**

The user instructed me to provide a list of top diagnoses and corresponding ICD-10 F-codes without reasoning. For the first diagnosis, I'm coding ""Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder with delusions"" as F12.250, confirming it fits the criteria based on my memory. Next, I'll list ""Cannabis use disorder, severe,"" potentially as F12.20. While this could be redundant, the user asked for a structured list that might include both. I need to be strategic about how to present these diagnoses while ensuring clarity and compliance with coding standards.

**Summarizing diagnoses and codes**

I've identified the top five diagnoses along with corresponding ICD-10 F-codes. They are:  
1. Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder, with delusions - F12.250  
2. Cannabis use disorder, severe - F12.20  
3. Bipolar I disorder - F31.9  
4. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type - F25.0  
5. Schizophrenia - F20.9  
I considered other alternatives like brief psychotic disorder and the relationship between cannabis use and mood episodes. But I think this structured list aligns best with the provided symptoms and makes sense based on the diagnoses.

**Finalizing the list of diagnoses**

I need to provide a structured list of the top five psychiatric diagnoses, ensuring they're not mutually exclusive. Here’s what I’ve come up with:  
1. Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder, with delusions (onset during intoxication) - F12.250  
2. Cannabis use disorder, severe - F12.20  
3. Bipolar I disorder - F31.9  
4. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type - F25.0  
5. Brief psychotic disorder - F23  

I carefully considered other options like schizophreniform disorder and unspecified disorders, but this list should adequately reflect the most likely diagnoses based on the provided information.

**Ranking psychiatric diagnoses**

I need to thoughtfully rank the top five psychiatric diagnoses. Initially, I’ll list: 

1. Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder, with delusions (onset during intoxication) - F12.250  
2. Cannabis use disorder, severe - F12.20  
3. Bipolar I disorder - F31.9  
4. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type - F25.0  
5. Schizophrenia - F20.9  

I’ve carefully considered the specifics of the case, including the patient's history of multiple episodes and hospitalizations. I’m weighing factors like the likelihood of these disorders co-occurring and the relevance of acute and chronic conditions.

**Clarifying diagnoses and codes**

I need to ensure I provide a structured list of the top five DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses along with their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes. For “Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder,” I’m opting for F12.250, which reflects the presence of delusions. Additionally, I’ll include “Cannabis use disorder, severe” with F12.20. 

The challenge lies in avoiding redundancy while accurately reflecting the conditions. Hence, I’ll be careful to select codes that do not contradict each other, focusing on clarity for each diagnosis.

**Deciding on diagnosis codes**

I'm considering whether to list cannabis use disorder separately since using F12.250 for cannabis-induced psychotic disorder might conflict. We need five diagnoses; however, cannabis use disorder seems critical to include. I can choose F12.20 for it, but that implies uncomplicated use. Then there's the issue of redundancy if both conditions are addressed. Ultimately, I might prioritize cannabis use disorder as primary with F12.20 and cannabis-induced psychotic disorder as secondary with F12.250, following DSM guidelines for clarity in coding both when applicable.

**Clarifying diagnosis codes**

I'm reviewing the coding for alcohol-induced psychotic disorder. It appears the DSM uses F10.159 for mild alcohol use disorder and F10.259 for moderate/severe alcohol-related conditions. If both diagnoses apply, I might list them together, even if it feels a bit awkward. While considering other diagnoses, I see I can include cannabis-induced psychotic disorder (F12.250) and severe cannabis use disorder (F12.20), along with bipolar I disorder. I'm also weighing schizoaffective disorder and substance-induced bipolar disorder as potential secondary diagnoses. The goal is to list relevant codes accurately!

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

I'm determining the primary diagnosis based on the patient’s condition. Given the heavy cannabis use and the context of psychosis, I’ll classify ""Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder, with delusions"" as the primary diagnosis (F12.250). The second diagnosis is ""Cannabis use disorder, severe"" (F12.20), followed by ""Bipolar I disorder"" (F31.9), ""Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type"" (F25.0), and finally ""Schizophrenia"" (F20.9). The goal is to prioritize the diagnoses according to the situation while keeping it clear and organized!

**Finalizing F codes**

I need to ensure that I'm only including F codes in the output. In ICD-10-CM, F20.9 represents ""Schizophrenia, unspecified,"" while in DSM-5-TR, it simply uses ""Schizophrenia"" with the same code. So, I’ll finalize this by confirming I’m being clear and precise with the codes I’m using. It’s important to be accurate here, so let's proceed carefully and make sure everything aligns perfectly!","1.

91,"Lara Gonzalez, a 51-year-old divorced freelance journalist, brought herself to the emergency room requesting dermatological evaluation for flea infestation. When no corroborating evidence was found on skin examination and the patient insisted that she was unsafe at home, she was admitted to an inpatient psychiatric service with “unspecified psychotic disorder.”

Her concerns began around 1 week prior to presentation. To contend with financial stress, she had taken in temporary renters for a spare room in her home and had begun pet sitting for some neighbors. Under these conditions, she perceived tiny insects burrowing into her skin and walls and covering her rugs and mattress. She had spent the 36 hours prior to presentation frantically cleaning her home, fearing that her tenants would not pay if they saw the fleas. She showered repeatedly, using shampoos meant to treat animal infestations, and she consulted three different exterminators, although none found evidence of fleas. She threw away a bag of clothing, believing she heard fleas “rustling and scratching inside.” She bought replacement clothes that she kept in their own trash bag, thereby spending almost all of her savings, which worsened her preexisting financial strain.

Aside from her concerns about infestation, Ms. Gonzalez denied symptoms of depression, mania, and suspiciousness. She denied using any drugs or alcohol. No one in her family had a history of psychiatric illness. Ms. Gonzalez had been diagnosed with depression in college and briefly treated with an antidepressant. She had no relevant medical problems.

Her worries about infestation began in the setting of her sister’s diagnosis with invasive cancer, the onset of her own menopause, financial strain that was likely forcing her to move from the United States back to Argentina (her country of origin), and a recent breakup with her boyfriend. At baseline, she described herself as an obsessive person who had always had “contamination phobias” that historically worsened during times of anxiety.

On mental status examination, Ms. Gonzalez was calm and easily engaged, with normal relatedness and eye contact. She offered up a small plastic bag containing “fleas and larvae” that she had collected in the hospital while awaiting evaluation. Inspection of the bag revealed lint and plaster. Her speech had an urgent quality to it, and she described her mood as “sad right now.” She was tearful intermittently but otherwise smiling reactively. Her thoughts were overly inclusive and intensely focused on fleas. She expressed belief that each time a hair fell out of her head, it would morph into larvae. When crying, she believed an egg came out of her tear duct. She was not suicidal or homicidal. She expressed an unshakable belief that lint was larvae, and that she was infested. She denied hallucinations. Cognition was intact. Her insight was impaired, but her judgment was deemed reasonably appropriate.

Dermatological examination revealed no insects or larvae embedded in Ms. Gonzalez’s skin. Results of neurological examination, head computed tomography scan, laboratory tests, and toxicology data were normal. She was discharged from the emergency room on a low-dose antipsychotic medication and seen weekly for supportive psychotherapy. Her preoccupation improved within days and resolved entirely within 2 weeks. She developed enough insight to refer to her belief that fleas were in her skin as a “crazy thought.” She attributed her “break from reality” to multiple stressors, and was able to articulate that she relied on her delusion as a way to distract herself from real problems. Her family corroborated her quick return to baseline.",Brief psychotic disorder with marked stressors,dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Evaluating potential diagnoses**

I’m considering the task of providing the top five possible diagnoses, so I should include delusional disorder even if the duration isn't met. It might relate to the DSM-5 category for ""Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder"" with delusional symptoms in a partner. For symptoms lasting less than a month, brief psychotic disorder is another option. There’s also the possibility of a psychotic disorder due to a medical condition, but tests were normal. Finally, I’m pondering whether it could be adjustment disorder with anxiety.

**Analyzing symptoms for diagnosis**

The user presents stressors and anxiety, which could indicate psychosis due to delusions. One possibility is somatic type delusional disorder or delusional parasitosis. Another option is obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) with absent insight, where her strong belief could be misinterpreted as delusional. She described contamination fears and cleansing behaviors, but those actions might just be compulsive rather than delusional. Although she doesn't view her beliefs as intrusive, the consistency of her conviction leans more towards delusion. I’m also considering body dysmorphic disorder or excoriation disorder, but those seem less likely.

**Determining possible diagnoses**

I’m looking for five possible diagnoses based on the user’s quick resolution in two weeks, indicating transient stress-related psychosis. First, there’s brief psychotic disorder with marked stressors (F23). Second could be obsessive-compulsive disorder (F42), or perhaps an ""Other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder"" or obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (F60.5), which aligns with her lifelong obsessive personality and contamination fears. However, I only have her self-report. The historical obsession about contamination suggests OCD, but there’s also the possibility of phobic avoidance. Overall, I need to extract subtle cues for a nuanced list.

**Identifying likely DSM-5 diagnoses**

I need to provide the top five probable DSM-5-TR diagnoses along with their F-codes. First, I’ll consider borderline personality disorder (BPD) as the primary diagnosis. For secondary options, there’s delusional disorder, somatic type (F22), even though the duration is under one month. Another is obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD, F42) or adjustment disorder with anxiety (F43.22) due to significant stressors. Major depressive disorder might be possible, but her symptoms seem mild. Illness anxiety disorder could also fit, and there’s ""delusional infestation"" to consider, but tests are normal, making some less likely.

**Selecting probable diagnoses**

I need to provide the top five likely DSM-5 psychiatric diagnoses with F-codes. The primary candidate is borderline personality disorder (BPD). As for secondary diagnoses, I’m considering brief psychotic disorder with marked stressors, OCD (F42), and delusional disorder, somatic type (F22). Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood (F43.23) is secondary, given her sadness and stressors. I might also include obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (F60.5). While I need to ensure the diagnoses fit criteria, this list reflects plausible options based on her symptoms.

**Compiling potential diagnoses**

I need to create a structured list of the top 5 likely psychiatric diagnoses with F-codes. The main candidate remains brief psychotic disorder with marked stressors (F23). I’m considering obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD, F42) as a secondary option due to her contamination phobias, along with delusional disorder, somatic type (F22). I might include adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood (F43.23). Lastly, I’m contemplating major depressive disorder, single episode, in full remission (F32.5) given her past depression. This list incorporates plausible options based on her symptoms and history.

**Finalizing the top diagnoses**

I’m considering a structured list of psychiatric diagnoses for this case. I think the primary diagnosis should be brief psychotic disorder with marked stressors (F23). As for secondary diagnoses, I can include obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD, F42) because of her contamination phobias, delusional disorder, somatic type (F22) as a differential, and adjustment disorder with anxiety (F43.22) or mixed symptoms (F43.23). Lastly, I could mention major depressive disorder, single episode, in full remission (F32.5) due to her past history. This structure captures her current situation effectively!

**Summarizing possible diagnoses**

I'm considering a range of psychiatric diagnoses based on the case details. The primary diagnosis will be brief psychotic disorder with marked stressors (F23). For secondary diagnoses, I can include obsessive-compulsive disorder (F42), delusional disorder, somatic type (F22), adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood (F43.23), and potentially obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (F60.5) if deemed appropriate. This list consists of both current and differential diagnoses and follows the required structure with corresponding ICD-10 codes.

**Compiling likely diagnoses**

I'm weighing various psychiatric diagnoses based on the details provided. For the primary diagnosis, I think brief psychotic disorder with marked stressors (F23) is appropriate. For secondary diagnoses, I might include delusional disorder, somatic type (F22), obsessive-compulsive disorder with absent insight (F42), psychotic disorder due to another medical condition (F06.2), and possibly substance-induced psychotic disorder (F19.959). This list combines current and differential diagnoses, aligning with the instructions while ensuring the F-codes are accurate.

**Determining priority diagnoses**

I’m considering the possible diagnoses, starting with major depressive disorder, single episode, in full remission (F32.5) due to past history. However, since there's uncertainty about meeting criteria, I might focus more on stronger options. Brief psychotic disorder with marked stressor (F23) seems appropriate, along with delusional disorder, somatic type (F22), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (F42). For additional secondary diagnoses, I’ll likely include adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood (F43.23) and possibly unspecified anxiety disorder (F41.9) as they relate to her current concerns.

**Ranking possible diagnoses**

The individual is exhibiting sadness and tearfulness but denies depression. I’m considering potential diagnoses: I think ""Brief psychotic disorder with marked stressor(s)"" (F23) could fit, as well as ""Delusional disorder, somatic type"" (F22) and ""Obsessive-compulsive disorder"" (F42). Adjustments might include ""Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.2) and possibly ""Schizophreniform disorder"" (F20.81). Yet, given the context, incorporating adjustment disorder appears to be more plausible than medical or substance-induced psychosis. The focus should remain on those most likely diagnoses based on presented symptoms.

**Creating diagnostic list**

I’m preparing a list of probable diagnoses and their corresponding ICD-10 codes. Here’s what I’ve decided on:

1. Brief psychotic disorder, with marked stressor(s) - F23
2. Obsessive-compulsive disorder - F42
3. Delusional disorder, somatic type - F22
4. Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood - F43.23
5. Major depressive disorder, single episode, in full remission - F32.5

92,"An African American man who appeared to be in his 30s was brought to an urban emergency room (ER) by police after neighbors complained that he had been loudly knocking on many doors in the neighborhood. The referral form indicated that the man was “schizophrenic” and an “emotionally disturbed person.” One of the police officers said that the man offered to pay them for sex while in the back seat of their patrol car. He referred to himself as the “New Jesus” and declined to offer another name. He refused to sit and instead ran through the ER. He was put into restraints and received intramuscularly administered lorazepam 2 mg and haloperidol 5 mg. Intravenous diphenhydramine (Benadryl) 50 mg was readied in case of extrapyramidal side effects. The admitting team wrote that he had “unspecified psychosis” and transferred him to the psychiatry team that worked in the ER.

Despite being restrained, the patient remained giddily agitated, talking about receiving messages from God. When asked when he had last slept, he said he no longer needed sleep, indicating that he had “been touched by Heaven.” His speech was rapid, disorganized, and difficult to understand. A complete blood count, blood chemistries, and a toxicology screen were drawn. After an additional 45 minutes of agitation, he received another dose of lorazepam. This calmed him, but he still did not sleep. The restraints were removed.

An hour after receiving the initial haloperidol and lorazepam, the patient was interviewed while he sat in a chair in the ER. He was an overweight African American man who was disheveled and malodorous. He did not smell of alcohol. He made poor eye contact, instead looking at nearby people, a ticking clock, the examiner, a nearby nurse—at anything or anyone that moved. His speech was disorganized, rapid, and hard to follow. His leg bounced rapidly up and down, but he did not get out of his chair or threaten the interviewer. He described his mood as “not bad.” His affect was labile. He often laughed for no particular reason but would get angrily frustrated when he felt misunderstood. His thought process was disorganized. He had grandiose delusions, and his perceptions were significant for “God talking to me.” He denied other hallucinations and denied suicidal and homicidal ideation. When asked the date, he responded with an extended discussion about the underlying meaning of the day’s date, which he missed by a single day. He remembered the names of the two police officers who had brought him to the hospital. He refused more cognitive testing. His insight and judgment appeared poor.

The patient’s sister arrived an hour later, after having been called by a neighbor who had seen her brother, Mark Hill, being taken away in a police car. The sister said that her brother had seemed strange a week earlier, uncharacteristically arguing with relatives at a holiday gathering. He had claimed not to need sleep at that time and had been talking about his “gifts.” She had tried to contact Mr. Hill since then, but he had not responded to phone, e-mail, or text messages. She said he did not like to talk about his issues, but she had twice seen a bottle of olanzapine in his house. She knew their father had been called “schizophrenic” and “bipolar,” but she had not seen her father since she was a child. She said that Mr. Hill did not typically use drugs. She also said he was 34 years old and a middle school math teacher who had just finished a semester of teaching.

A review of Mr. Hill’s electronic medical record indicated that he had experienced a similar episode 2 years earlier. At that time, a toxicology screen had been negative. He had been hospitalized for 2 weeks on the inpatient psychiatric service and was given a discharge diagnosis of “schizoaffective disorder”; he also was prescribed olanzapine and referred to an outpatient clinic for follow-up. The chart had additionally referred to two previous admissions to the county inpatient hospital, but records from that hospital were not available after hours.

Over the next 24 hours, Mr. Hill calmed significantly. He continued to believe that he was being misunderstood and that he did not need to be hospitalized. When asked, he agreed that he had a direct connection to God and “an important role on Earth,” but he denied having a connection to anyone called the “New Jesus.” His speech remained rapid and loud. The interviewer noted that he seemed easier to redirect, though his thoughts continued to jump from idea to idea. He remained tense and jumpy but denied paranoia or fear.

Serial physical examinations revealed no abnormalities aside from blisters on his feet. The patient was not tremulous, and his deep tendon reflexes were symmetrical and graded 2 of 4. He showed no neurological asymmetry. His toxicology screen was negative and his blood alcohol level was zero. His initial lab results were pertinent for elevated blood urea nitrogen and a blood sugar level of 210 mg/dL. His mean corpuscular volume, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ratio, and magnesium levels were normal. His BMI was 30.8.","Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe, with mood-congruent psychotic features",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Reviewing ICD-10 for mood disorders**

I need to check the accurate ICD-10 codes for substance-induced mood disorder. In ICD-10-CM, the codes for these disorders are found within the F10-F19 range, with additional characters for specificity. For instance, F15.159 is for unspecified stimulant use with induced psychotic disorder. There’s no unique code for substance-induced bipolar disorder; it’s coded as a mood disorder. I’m considering using the DSM-5's terminology for clarity, especially when determining the codes based on substance onset during intoxication.

**Identifying likely diagnoses and codes**

For the question regarding DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses, I’m considering “Unspecified bipolar and related disorder” F31.9 as a potential diagnosis. I need to create a structured list of the top five likely diagnoses and their corresponding ICD-10 codes. Each must include F-codes. Here’s what I have so far: 

1. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features: F31.2.  
2. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type: F25.0.  
3. Schizophrenia, unspecified: F20.9.  
4. Brief psychotic disorder: F23.  
5. Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder: considering F19.959 or F19.951.

**Selecting appropriate diagnoses**

I'm considering whether to choose ""Unspecified bipolar and related disorder"" F31.9 or ""Unspecified psychotic disorder"" F29 over uncertain substance codes. We already have three confirmed diagnoses, and I can add F29 and F23. However, I want to ensure we have five. I think ""Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder"" F28 could be included, but F29 feels more plausible. 

In the end, here are my top five:  
1. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe, with psychotic features (F31.2).  
2. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type (F25.0).  
3. Schizophrenia (F20.9).  
4. Unspecified psychotic disorder (F29).  
5. Brief psychotic disorder (F23).

**Clarifying diagnosis options**

I’m considering the order of my diagnoses. Brief psychotic disorder might be rated lower than unspecified psychosis, but I’m also thinking about including “Delusional disorder.” However, the case involves disorganized speech and hallucinations. Another option is “Bipolar disorder due to another medical condition” (F06.33), but there’s no evidence for that. 

I’ll validate each code against the DSM-5-TR. F23 is confirmed as brief psychotic disorder, and F29 is for unspecified psychosis, which aligns with DSM criteria. So, I can definitely use F29.

**Finalizing diagnoses list**

I’m refining my list of diagnoses. Here are the top five likely options with corresponding ICD-10 F-codes:

1. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe, with psychotic features (F31.2).
2. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type (F25.0).
3. Schizophrenia (F20.9).
4. Brief psychotic disorder (F23).
5. Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder (F29). 

I'm keeping these diagnoses aligned with the DSM-5-TR while ensuring the F-codes are accurate and applicable.

**Refining the psychiatric list**

I’m working on my differential diagnosis. Here’s what I have for the top five likely diagnoses with their corresponding F-codes:

1. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features (F31.2).
2. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type (F25.0).
3. Schizophrenia (F20.9).
4. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition (F06.2).
5. Brief psychotic disorder (F23).

I want to ensure that each diagnosis is accurate according to the DSM-5-TR and use valid codes that reflect the patient’s condition.

**Finalizing psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm reviewing the candidate diagnoses and their corresponding F-codes. My top five likely diagnoses are:

1. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features - F31.2
2. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type - F25.0
3. Schizophrenia, unspecified - F20.9
4. Brief psychotic disorder - F23
5. Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder - F29

I need to ensure that each diagnosis and code accurately reflects the patient's condition while adhering to the instructions given.

**Crafting final diagnosis list**

I need to determine the ranking between F29 as ""unspecified schizophrenia spectrum"" and F23 as ""brief psychotic disorder."" It seems reasonable to rank F23 higher as 4 and F29 as 5 since F29 is more general. I'm ensuring no duplicates and that all options are plausible. I’ll focus on providing a structured list of diagnoses along with their corresponding F-codes without showing my reasoning. Here’s my final output:

93,"Nancy Ingram, a 33-year-old stock analyst and married mother of two children, was brought to the emergency room (ER) after 10 days of what her husband described as “another cycle of depression,” marked by a hair-trigger temper, tearfulness, and almost no sleep. He noted that these “dark periods” had gone on as long as he had known her but that she had experienced at least a half dozen of these episodes in the prior year. He said they typically improved within a few weeks of restarting her fluoxetine. He added that he wondered whether alcohol and clonazepam worsened her symptoms, because she routinely ramped up their use when the dark periods began.

Ms. Ingram’s husband said he had decided to bring her to the ER after he discovered that she had recently created a blog entitled Nancy Ingram’s Best Stock Picks. Such an activity not only was out of character but also, given her job as a stock analyst for a large investment bank, was strictly against company policy. He said that she had been working on these stock picks around the clock, forgoing her own meals as well as her responsibilities at work and with her children. She countered that she was fine and that her blog would “make them as rich as Croesus.”

The patient had first been diagnosed with depression in college, after the death of her father from suicide. He had been a wildly erratic, alcohol-abusing businessman whom the patient loved very much. Her paternal grandmother had several “nervous breakdowns,” but her diagnosis and treatment history were unknown. Since college, her mood had generally been “down,” interspersed with recurrent bouts of worsened dysphoria, insomnia, and uncharacteristically rapid speech and hyperalertness. She had tried psychotherapy sporadically and taken a series of antidepressant medications, but her husband noted that the baseline depression persisted and that the dark periods were increasing in frequency.

Her outpatient psychiatrist noted that Ms. Ingram appeared to have dysthymia (persistent depressive disorder) and recurrent major depressive disorder. He also said that he had never seen her during her periods of edginess and insomnia—she always refused to see him until the “really down” periods improved—and that she had refused him access to her husband or to any other source of collateral information.

On examination, the patient was pacing angrily in the exam room. She was dressed in jeans and a shirt that was carelessly unbuttoned. Her eyes appeared glazed and unfocused. She responded to the examiner’s entrance by sitting down and explaining that this was all a miscommunication, that she was fine and needed to get home immediately to tend to her business. Her speech was rapid, pressured, and very difficult to interrupt. She admitted to not sleeping but denied that it was a problem. She denied hallucinations but admitted, with a smile, to a unique ability to predict the stock market. She refused cognitive testing, saying she would decline the opportunity to be “a trained seal, a guinea pig, Mr. Ed, and a barking dog, thank you very much, and may I leave now?” Her insight into her situation appeared poor, and her judgment was deemed to be impaired.","Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, with mixed features and rapid cycling",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Evaluating mood disorder codes**

ICD-10-CM has specific codes for substance-induced mood disorders like F10.14 for alcohol-induced mood disorder with depressive features. However, I’m unsure about bipolar—it might be F19.94 for unspecified psychoactive substance-induced mood disorder. I know there are other serious mood disorder codes like F06.33 for medication-induced disorders. It seems I need to focus on finding legitimate F-codes for each potential diagnosis while considering factors like alcohol and clonazepam use.

**Selecting differential diagnoses**

I'm considering including diagnoses like Alcohol Use Disorder and Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder as differentials. Another option is Bipolar II Disorder (F31.81), Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent (F33.9), and Cyclothymic Disorder (F34.0). I know I need four secondary diagnoses that are recognized by DSM-5-TR and have ICD-10 F-codes. I want to determine the top four based on likelihood, keeping in mind that if Bipolar I is accurate, Bipolar II would be less probable.

**Clarifying diagnosis instructions**

The instructions specify that I should provide a structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses, potentially including comorbid diagnoses. However, it seems like Bipolar II can't be diagnosed concurrently, but I may include it as a differential. They’ve requested the top five most likely diagnoses with corresponding ICD-10 F-codes. I understand this might focus more on a differential list rather than comorbid conditions. I'll stick with plausible diagnoses, avoiding any assumptions and ensuring I use unspecified codes where applicable. Given the context, alcohol use disorder might be a consideration.

**Listing plausible diagnoses**

I’m leaning towards including some secondary diagnoses, even if we can't confirm them fully. For example, “Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder” seems likely since clonazepam usage increases when episodes start, suggesting potential misuse. She has chronic depressed mood, possibly fitting Persistent Depressive Disorder or Major Depressive Disorder. 

So I’m thinking of structuring the list as follows:  
- Bipolar I Disorder (primary)  
- Bipolar II Disorder (secondary)  
- Cyclothymic Disorder (secondary)  
- Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar and Related Disorder (secondary)  
- Alcohol Use Disorder or Sedative Use Disorder as a secondary option.

**Determining appropriate F-codes**

For substance-induced disorders, I need to select ICD codes properly. For substance-induced bipolar disorder, codes like F10.14 (alcohol-induced disorder) come to mind, but I'm questioning whether it fits. I’m considering plausible diagnoses: primarily Bipolar I with severe manic features (F31.13). I also want to include secondary conditions like Alcohol Use Disorder (F10.20) and Sedative Use Disorder. However, I’m unsure about specific severity levels for alcohol use. It seems using F10.10 might be a conservative estimate. I have to consider the overall diagnostic picture while avoiding overlaps in the differential list.

**Clarifying differential diagnoses**

I’m analyzing various possible diagnoses for this case. For the differential list, I’m considering Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder (F13.20) and Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent (F33.9), although depressive episodes can be misdiagnosed in bipolar cases. Cyclothymic disorder (F34.0) and Bipolar II disorder (F31.81) are also on my mind, but it seems likely that the current episodes reflect more significant mania than hypomania. Ultimately, Bipolar I disorder is the primary diagnosis, and I’ll need to select relevant secondary diagnoses focusing on likely conditions.

**Evaluating potential diagnoses**

I'm sorting through possible diagnoses and thinking about Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD), which can't have a history of mania. Although the psychiatrist suspected PDD, the current presence of mania complicates matters. I realize if the symptoms are induced by medication, this might allow for PDD. It seems I should consider a diagnosis of Bipolar II disorder or recurrent major depressive disorder, but PDD can't co-occur with mania. I need to ensure my top five diagnoses are clear and accurate, factoring all this uncertainty.

**Determining primary and secondary diagnoses**

I'm thinking it might be best to list ""Bipolar I disorder"" as the primary diagnosis, followed by alcohol use disorder, sedative use disorder, recurrent major depressive disorder, and possibly persistent depressive disorder as differentials if we doubt the mania diagnosis. However, I realize bipolar I should be at the top. The manic episode features are compelling, and while I have some uncertainty about the accuracy of other diagnoses, I'm settling on my final five diagnoses clearly and systematically.

**Choosing diagnoses for consideration**

I'm weighing whether to include Bipolar II as a diagnosis versus Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Since there seems to be clear evidence of mania, Bipolar I could be more appropriate. I can see the merit of Cyclothymic disorder as well, but it's tricky since there are indications of full mania. As for secondaries, I'm considering alcohol use disorder and sedative use disorder. Including MDD and persistent depressive disorder makes sense for thoroughness in differential diagnosis. I need to tighten things up and finalize my list of the most plausible diagnoses.

**Refining differential diagnoses**

I'm considering whether to include Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in my differential. Although MDD might be supported by her initial diagnosis and prolonged depressed mood, the evidence from the history suggests that I could replace one of the substance use diagnoses with MDD. The current episode's length is not enough for a major depressive episode diagnosis since it hasn't reached two weeks. So, I'm leaning towards listing Bipolar I disorder as primary, alongside alcohol use disorder and other mood disorders as secondaries.

**Clarifying substance use codes**

I'm wrestling with how to classify substance use disorders. Using unspecified severity codes may be better, but I'll opt for ""Alcohol use disorder"" coded as F10.10 (mild) and ""Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder"" as F13.10. These choices imply uncomplicated abuse, but I don't have enough evidence to confirm abuse. When listing diagnoses, I'll avoid using ""provisional"" language and simply provide the top five likely conditions, which will include bipolar disorders and the substance use disorders based on the evidence I have.","1.

94,"Olivia Jacobs, a 22-year-old graduate student in architecture, was referred for an urgent psychiatric consultation after she told her roommate that she was suicidal. Ms. Jacobs had a history of mood symptoms that had been under good control with lithium and sertraline, but her depressive symptoms had returned soon after she had arrived in a new city for school, 3 months earlier. She had become preoccupied with ways in which she might kill herself without inconveniencing others. Her dominant suicidal thoughts involved shooting herself in the head while leaning out the window, so as not to cause a mess in the dorm. Although she did not have access to a gun, she spent time searching the Web for places where she might purchase one.

Ms. Jacobs’s psychiatric history began at age 15, when she began to regularly drink alcohol and smoke marijuana, usually when out at dance clubs with friends. Both of these substances calmed her, and she denied that either had become problematic. She had used neither alcohol nor marijuana since starting graduate school.

Around age 17, she began experiencing brief, intense depressive episodes, marked by tearfulness, feelings of guilt, anhedonia, hopelessness, low energy, and poor concentration. She would sleep more than 12 hours a day and neglect responsibilities at school and home.

These depressive episodes would generally shift after a few weeks into periods of increased energy, pressured speech, and unusual creativity. She would stay up most of the night working on projects and building architectural models. These revved-up episodes lasted about 5 days and were punctuated by feelings that her friends had turned against her and that they were not really friends at all. Worried especially about the paranoia, her family had brought her to a psychiatrist, who diagnosed her as having bipolar II disorder and prescribed lithium and sertraline. Although Ms. Jacobs’s moods did not completely stabilize on this regimen, she did well enough at a local university to be accepted into a prestigious graduate program far from home. At that point the depression returned, and she became intensely suicidal for the first time.

Upon evaluation, the patient was visibly depressed and tearful, and had psychomotor slowing. She said it was very difficult to get out of bed and she was not attending class most days. She reported hopelessness, poor concentration, and guilt about spending family money for school when she was not able to perform. She stated that she thought about suicide most of the time and that she had found nothing to distract her. She denied recent drinking or smoking marijuana, stating she did not feel like “partying.” She acknowledged profound feelings of emptiness and indicated that she had occasionally cut her arms superficially to “see what it would feel like.” She stated that she knew that cutting herself in this way would not kill her. She reported depersonalization and occasional panic attacks. She denied having mood instability, derealization, problems with impulsivity, concerns about her identity, and fears of abandonment.","1. Bipolar II disorder, current episode depressed; high level of concern about suicide
2. Unspecified anxiety disorder",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Determining psychiatric diagnoses**

I need to focus on providing DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses, not differential diagnoses, but I should still aim for the top five. It’s essential to include conditions that best fit the data while considering relevant comorbidities. However, I must avoid options that seem unlikely based on the information given. I think I’ll need to identify four secondary plausible options, like Bipolar I disorder or Major depressive disorder, and determine the appropriate F-codes for each. Let’s analyze this further!

**Analyzing vignette details**

I have a vignette about a 22-year-old graduate student who moved to a new city three months ago. She has a history of mood symptoms managed by lithium and sertraline, but depressive symptoms returned after her move. She's preoccupied with suicidal thoughts and has even searched for means online.

Her psychiatric history includes early substance use and intense depressive episodes beginning at 17, marked by tearfulness and low energy. These later shifted to manic-like periods of creativity and heightened energy. It’s important I consider all this when evaluating her case.

**Evaluating psychiatric symptoms**

There’s a family concern about paranoia, and the psychiatrist has diagnosed her with bipolar II, prescribing lithium and sertraline. Although her moods stabilized somewhat, she faced a return of depression, which brought intense suicidal thoughts.

During evaluation, I noticed she was depressed, tearful, and had psychomotor slowing. She struggled to get out of bed and attend class, experiencing hopelessness and guilt. Suicidal thoughts were frequent, and although she reported emptiness and superficial cutting, she denied recent substance use. I believe she fits the criteria for a major depressive episode within bipolar II. Her hypomanic episodes, described as five days of increased energy and creativity, didn’t include grandiosity or risky behavior.

**Assessing mood symptoms**

According to the DSM-5, a hypomanic episode requires an elevated or irritable mood for at least four days, along with three or more symptoms. In this case, she exhibits increased energy, pressured speech, decreased sleep, and heightened goal-directed activity, which supports hypomania.

However, she has also experienced major depressive episodes, so she fits the bipolar II diagnosis. Her feelings of friends turning against her suggest possible paranoia, but it might be interpersonal sensitivity rather than full delusions. Borderline-type transient paranoia could occur during hypomanic episodes, but it doesn't seem to fit as psychosis. It's unlikely she's cyclothymic, as she meets criteria for full major depressive episodes.

**Exploring potential diagnoses**

Could she have major depressive disorder with mixed features? There are signs of increased energy, but those seem to be separate episodes. Her past bipolar II diagnosis might also explain her symptoms, alongside feelings of emptiness and self-harm. 

However, she denies critical features like impulsivity or mood instability that would support borderline personality disorder. While she displays some symptoms of transient paranoia, those may not qualify as delusions. Overall, I'll assess potential diagnoses including bipolar II disorder, major depressive episodes, and possibly non-suicidal self-injury or anxiety. I need to be careful in selecting these secondary diagnoses based on available evidence.

**Assessing diagnostic codes**

I'm considering whether specific ICD-10 F-codes apply here. For instance, ""Nonsuicidal self-harm"" has codes like R45.88, but those aren't allowed. I can look at ""Unspecified dissociative disorder (F44.9)"" or ""Depersonalization/derealization disorder (F48.1)""; however, the frequency or duration is important. 

Given her diagnosis, I want to list the most relevant psychiatric diagnoses. I think the primary will be ""Bipolar II disorder (F31.81)"" and then find secondary options while avoiding overly contradictory ones. I should include those that fit her symptoms, as supported by the vignette.

**Developing differential diagnoses**

I need to create a structured list of the top 5 differential diagnoses. The primary will be Bipolar II disorder since there's a history of episodes. For secondaries, I’ll consider conditions like Borderline personality disorder, Major depressive disorder, and maybe Depersonalization/derealization disorder for the secondary impacts of mood changes. Panic disorder could also be included given her occasional attacks.

I’ll ensure that all listed diagnoses align with DSM-5-TR criteria and match corresponding ICD-10 codes! It looks like I've got a good foundation to work with.

**Identifying differential diagnoses**

I’m figuring out the top 5 differential diagnoses. Starting with Bipolar II disorder for the primary diagnosis since there are recurrent depressive episodes. For the secondary diagnoses, I’ll consider Major depressive disorder, but it seems less likely due to the complex episode history. I should definitely include Panic disorder and Depersonalization/derealization disorder due to her symptoms. I'll weigh the plausibility of other diagnoses like Borderline personality disorder. Ultimately, I want a coherent list that fits the vignette provided!

**Creating a differential list**

I’m pulling together a final list of diagnoses, starting with Bipolar II disorder as the primary diagnosis. Then I’m considering Borderline personality disorder, Panic disorder, Depersonalization/derealization disorder, and Major depressive disorder as secondary options, focusing on ICD-10 F codes like F31.81 for bipolar and F60.3 for borderline. I need to assess the plausibility of each diagnosis carefully, as some may overlap or conflict based on the patient’s symptoms and history. Ultimately, I want to ensure a comprehensive yet coherent list!

**Compiling a diagnosis list**

I’m evaluating potential diagnoses for the patient, which might include conditions like Borderline personality disorder, Depersonalization/derealization disorder, Panic disorder, and Considering Bipolar II disorder as the primary diagnosis. I have to be careful about the coding and ensure each diagnosis corresponds accurately to the DSM-5-TR. The final list will need to be clear and structured, formatted with each diagnosis and its respective ICD-10 code, while adhering to the user's instructions for simplicity and clarity.

**Deciding on diagnoses**

I'm working on finalizing a list of diagnoses for the patient. The primary diagnosis will be Bipolar II disorder, and I'm considering secondary options like Borderline personality disorder, Other specified anxiety disorder, Other specified dissociative disorder, and Major depressive disorder. Although I might need to weigh those last two more carefully, especially since MDD might be less likely due to the history of hypomanic episodes. I also need to ensure I format everything properly, following the guidelines to create a coherent and accurate diagnosis list.

**Choosing diagnoses**

I'm deciding on the best set of diagnoses for the patient. We'll start with Bipolar II disorder as the primary diagnosis. For the secondary diagnoses, I'm considering Borderline personality disorder, Other specified anxiety disorder, and Depersonalization/derealization disorder. I realize I need to weigh these carefully; including conditions like ""Other specified personality disorder (borderline traits)"" is important since the patient meets some criteria. I will ensure the formatting matches what’s needed, and I want to capture the nuances of her symptoms accurately.

**Refining diagnoses**

I'm working on refining the DSM-5-TR diagnoses. I’ll specify ""Other specified personality disorder with borderline features"" instead of outright labeling it as Borderline personality disorder, as that might not fully fit given the symptoms described. I also need to choose the top four secondary diagnoses, so using ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" works for her panic attacks. The list is shaping up with Bipolar II as the primary, along with the other specified conditions, while ensuring they represent her symptoms accurately.

**Finalizing diagnoses**

I'm narrowing down the DSM-5-TR diagnoses and considering various options. I think I should include ""Bipolar II disorder, current episode depressed"" as the primary diagnosis, along with ""Major depressive disorder"" as a possible differential since hypomania isn’t confirmed. For secondary diagnoses, I might use ""Other specified personality disorder"" and ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" due to symptoms like panic attacks. Additionally, I’m leaning towards ""Depersonalization/derealization disorder"" or ""Other specified dissociative disorder"" based on her experiences with depersonalization.

95,"Pamela Kershaw was a 43-year-old married librarian who presented to an outpatient mental health clinic with a long history of episodic depressions. Most recently, she described depressed mood during the month since she began a new job. She said she was preoccupied with concerns that her new boss and colleagues thought her work was inadequate and slow and that she was unfriendly. She had no energy and enthusiasm at home, either, and instead of playing with her children or talking to her husband, she tended to watch television for hours, overeat, and sleep excessively. This had led to a 6-pound weight gain in just 3 weeks, which made her feel even worse about herself. She had begun to cry several times a week, which she reported as the sign that she “knew the depression had returned.” She had also begun to think often of death, although she had never attempted suicide.

Ms. Kershaw said her memory about her history of depressions was a little fuzzy, so she brought in her husband, who had known her since college. They agreed that she had first become depressed in her teens and that she had experienced at least five discrete periods of depression as an adult. These episodes generally included depressed mood, anergia, amotivation, hypersomnia, hyperphagia, deep feelings of guilt, decreased libido, and mild to moderate suicidal ideation without plan. Her depressions were often punctuated by periods of “too much” energy, irritability, pressured speech, and flight of ideas. These episodes of excess energy could last hours, days, or a couple of weeks. The depressed mood would not lift during these periods, but she would “at least be able to do a few things.”

When specifically asked, Ms. Kershaw’s husband described distinctive times when Ms. Kershaw seemed unusually excited, happy, and self-confident, and like a “different person.” She would talk fast, seem energized and optimistic, do the daily chores very efficiently, and start (and often finish) new projects. She would need little sleep and still be enthusiastic the next day. Ms. Kershaw recalled these periods but said they felt “normal.” In response to a question about hypersexuality, Ms. Kershaw smiled for the only time during the interview, saying that although her husband seemed to be including her good periods as part of her illness, he had not been complaining when she had her longest such episode (about 6 days) when they first started dating in college. Since then, she reported that these episodes were “fairly frequent” and lasted 2 or 3 days.

Because of her periodic low mood and thoughts of death, she had seen various psychiatrists since her mid-teenage years. Psychotherapy tended to work “okay” until she had another depressive episode, when she would be unable to attend sessions and would then just quit. Three antidepressant trials of adequate dosage and duration (6 months to 3 years) were each associated with short-term relief of depression, followed by relapse. Both alone and in the presence of her husband, Ms. Kershaw denied any history of alcohol or substance misuse. A maternal aunt and maternal grandfather had been recurrently hospitalized for mania, although Ms. Kershaw was quick to point out that she was “not at all like them.”

On examination, Ms. Kershaw was a well-groomed, overweight woman who often averted her eyes and tended to speak very softly. No abnormal motor movements were noted, but her movements were constrained, and she did not use hand gestures. Her mood was depressed. Her affect was sad and constricted. Her thought processes were fluid, though possibly slowed. Her thought content was notable for depressive content, including passive suicidal ideation without evidence of paranoia, hallucinations, or delusions. Her insight and judgment were intact.","Bipolar II disorder, current episode depressed, of moderate severity",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Evaluating bipolar diagnosis**

96,"Rachel, a 15-year-old girl, was referred for a psychiatric evaluation because of worsening difficulties at home and at school over the prior year. The mother’s chief concern was that “Rachel’s meds aren’t working.” Rachel said she had no particular complaints.

In meetings with the patient and her mother, both together and separately, both reported that Rachel’s grades had dropped from As and Bs to Cs and Ds, that she had lost many of her long-standing friends, and that conflicts at home had escalated to the point that her mother characterized her as “nasty and mean.”

Rachel first saw a psychiatrist at age 7 years when she was evaluated for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) because of long-standing restlessness, impulsivity, and distractibility. After behavioral interventions were ineffective, the patient began treatment with a methylphenidate-based medication at age 8. Improvement was seen at school, in her social life, and at home. For the ensuing 6 years, Rachel had done well and was “pretty much like other kids as long as she took her medicine.”

At around age 14, however, Rachel became “moody.” Instead of being a “bubbly teenager,” she would spend days by herself and hardly speak to anyone. During these periods of persistent sadness, she would sleep more than usual, complain that her friends didn’t like her anymore, and not seem interested in anything. At other times, she would be a “holy terror” at home, frequently yelling at her sister and parents to the point that everyone was “walking on eggshells.” At about that time, Rachel’s grades plummeted, and her pediatrician increased the dosage of her ADHD medication.

Rachel’s family history was pertinent for a father who “had real problems.” Although her mother did not know his diagnosis, he had been treated with lithium. The father had left the family before Rachel was born, and the two had never met.

In exploring the periods of irritability, dysphoria, and social isolation, the clinician asked whether there had been times in which Rachel was in an especially good mood. The mother recalled multiple periods in which her daughter would be “giddy” for a week or two. She would “laugh at anything” and would enthusiastically help out with and even initiate household chores. Because these were the “good phases,” the mother did not think these episodes were noteworthy.

Rachel had no general medical problems. She denied use of alcohol, illicit substances, and medications other than the prescribed ADHD medication.

On examination while alone, Rachel was a casually groomed teenager who was coherent and goal directed. She appeared wary and sad, with some affective constriction. She did not like how she had been feeling, saying she felt depressed for a week, then okay, then “hilarious” for a few days, then “murderous,” like someone was “churning up my insides.” She did not know why she felt like that, and she hated not knowing how she would be feeling the next day. She denied psychotic symptoms, confusion, and suicidal and homicidal thoughts. She was cognitively intact.",Cyclothymic disorder,dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Evaluating ICD-10-CM codes**

I'm checking the ICD-10-CM categories related to other stimulant abuse. I note several specific codes, such as F15.1x for other stimulant abuse and its variations for different disorders. However, since the medication (methylphenidate) is prescribed, it may not qualify as ""abuse."" I consider F15.94 for unspecified use with a mood disorder, but I think about whether it's truly applicable. There's also a possibility of medication-induced conditions, but they seem to fit better in a different category.

**Selecting appropriate diagnoses**

I want to ensure we choose diagnoses that fit correctly. I’m considering “Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition,” but it might not apply here. To narrow things down, I think it’s best to stick to the top five potential diagnoses.

1. Cyclothymic disorder (F34.0).
2. ADHD, combined presentation (F90.2).
3. Other specified bipolar disorder (F31.89).
4. Major depressive disorder, recurrent (F32.89) or unspecified depressive disorder (F32.A) for differential considerations.
5. Oppositional defiant disorder (F91.3) might be relevant, but it’s tricky given the context.

**Clarifying diagnosis structure**

I’m thinking about ""Unspecified bipolar and related disorder"" (F31.9), but since we've already diagnosed cyclothymic disorder, I know we can't have both. If cyclothymia is confirmed, we wouldn't diagnose other specified bipolar—though I should still consider a differential list. They request the top five diagnoses, including the primary and four secondary ones.

This means I need to provide actual diagnoses present, not just differentials, while keeping the structure clear. I'll clarify the main diagnosis as cyclothymic and then add relevant alternatives.

**Prioritizing differential diagnoses**

I could interpret this as a prioritized differential diagnosis list rather than one for comorbidities. They want the top five most likely diagnoses, where the primary diagnosis is the most likely, and secondary ones follow. ADHD should definitely be included, given the history. We also need to consider diagnoses like Bipolar I/II disorder, Cyclothymic disorder, substance/medication-induced bipolar, Major depressive disorder, and Disruptive mood dysregulation.

So, here's the prioritized list:
1. Cyclothymic disorder - F34.0
2. ADHD, combined presentation - F90.2
3. Bipolar II disorder - F31.81
4. Substance/medication-induced bipolar disorder - possibly F15.94
5. Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode (F33.1) or unspecified (F33.9).

**Crafting a diagnosis list**

I need to finalize a list of diagnoses while keeping everything clear and concise. Cyclothymic disorder and Bipolar II disorder can't coexist, but they can both appear on the differential list. For the primary diagnosis, I think Bipolar II disorder is appropriate given the mood patterns. 

Here’s my prioritized list of diagnoses:

1. Other specified bipolar and related disorder - F31.89  
2. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, combined presentation - F90.2  
3. Bipolar II disorder - F31.81  
4. Cyclothymic disorder - F34.0  
5. Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode, moderate - F33.1

**Determining primary diagnosis**

I need to finalize the top diagnosis for this case without assuming any additional details. It seems we're dealing with potential bipolar disorder versus cyclothymic disorder. Bipolar II disorder could be the primary choice since we see hypomanic and depressive episodes, but duration isn't explicitly clear. 

Given what's described, I'm leaning toward ""Other specified bipolar and related disorder"" because there's enough evidence of mood fluctuations without proving full episodes. Nevertheless, cyclothymic disorder is plausible due to the patterns, but considering the significant impairment, I'll propose the following diagnoses. 

1. Other specified bipolar and related disorder - F31.89  
2. Cyclothymic disorder - F34.0  
3. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, combined presentation - F90.2  
4. Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode - F33.1  
5. Bipolar II disorder - F31.81

**Finalizing potential diagnoses**

In this case, I'm considering Rachel's mood episodes, which might indicate other specified bipolar disorder due to their brevity. Her depressive episodes last about a week, and hypomanic ones a few days. Based on symptom reports and impact on her life, I’m leaning towards the following top five diagnoses:

1. Other specified bipolar and related disorder - F31.89 (primary).  
2. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, combined presentation - F90.2 (secondary).  
3. Cyclothymic disorder - F34.0 (alternative).  
4. Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode - F33.1 (or unspecified).  
5. Oppositional defiant disorder - F91.3.  

This list considers potential overlaps but prioritizes the strongest options.

**Evaluating primary diagnoses**

I'm considering the episodes Rachel has experienced and how they align with possible diagnoses. Cyclothymic disorder is a strong contender since symptoms might match. However, her mood swings (being ""giddy for a week or two"") could suggest hypomanic episodes, which would exclude cyclothymia. 

I’m proposing the following five likely diagnoses:

1. Cyclothymic disorder - F34.0  
2. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, combined presentation - F90.2  
3. Bipolar II disorder - F31.81  
4. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, unspecified - F33.9  
5. Oppositional defiant disorder - F91.3  

This list considers both mood disorder patterns and potential comorbidities.

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

I’m weighing the details about Rachel’s depressive episodes and episodes of giddiness to determine the correct diagnoses. Considering her experiences, the primary diagnosis could be “Cyclothymic disorder - F34.0” since it captures her fluctuating mood symptoms over time without requiring full episodes. 

I think I’ll rank the diagnoses like this: 
  
1. Cyclothymic disorder - F34.0  
2. Other specified bipolar and related disorder - F31.89  
3. Bipolar II disorder - F31.81  
4. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, combined presentation - F90.2  
5. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, moderate - F33.1  

This should provide a clear structure for her situation.

**Crafting diagnosis list**

I’m compiling a diagnosis list, considering ADHD as confirmed and noting possible Bipolar II disorder and medication-induced mood disorders.

For the primary diagnosis, I’m leaning toward “Cyclothymic disorder - F34.0” due to her fluctuating mood episodes. The secondary diagnoses could be:  

2. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, combined presentation - F90.2  
3. Bipolar II disorder - F31.81  
4. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, moderate - F33.1  
5. Other specified bipolar and related disorder - F31.89  

This way, I’m covering all possibilities while ensuring accuracy.

**Selecting diagnoses**

I’m deciding on the diagnosis list, with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) being a possible contender, but it's tricky due to uncertainty around the recurrent nature of episodes. For differentiation, I might lean towards ""Other specified depressive disorder"" - F32.89, as it aligns better with her brief depressive episodes.

The top five diagnoses including:  

1. Cyclothymic disorder - F34.0  
2. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, combined presentation - F90.2  
3. Bipolar II disorder - F31.81  
4. Other specified bipolar and related disorder - F31.89  
5. Other specified depressive disorder - F32.89  

This arrangement covers various conditions while being mindful of overlaps.

**Finalizing the diagnosis list**

I’m working on organizing the diagnosis list based on previous discussions. I’ve decided on the following:

1. Cyclothymic disorder - F34.0  
2. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, combined presentation - F90.2  
3. Bipolar II disorder - F31.81  
4. Other specified depressive disorder (e.g., recurrent brief depression) - F32.89  
5. Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar and Related Disorder (other stimulant-induced) - F15.94  

I think this covers the primary concerns while considering the nuances of her symptoms.

**Determining the top diagnoses**

For the top five likely diagnoses, I'm focusing on organized options. Here's what I'm thinking:

1. Cyclothymic disorder - F34.0  
2. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, combined presentation - F90.2  
3. Bipolar II disorder - F31.81  
4. Other specified depressive disorder - F32.89  
5. Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar and Related Disorder (other stimulant-induced) - F15.94

97,"Sebastian Lopez, a 27-year-old Hispanic freelance editor, was brought to his long-time HIV clinic by his worried partner. As the patient entered the clinic waiting room, he announced, “God has cured me! I can stop my antivirals!”

While Mr. Lopez fidgeted on a chair, furiously writing on a yellow pad, his partner provided the recent history. He said that the patient had been doing well until approximately 1 month earlier. At that point, he began an unusually intense editing project. After about 10 days of little sleep, “boundless energy,” and activity, Mr. Lopez seemed edgy, a little pressured, and “glassy-eyed.” That night, the two of them went to a party to celebrate the completion of the work project. Despite several years of Narcotics Anonymous meetings and abstinence from illicit substances, Mr. Lopez took crystal methamphetamine, a stimulant. Acutely anxious and paranoid that they were being followed, Mr. Lopez drank three martinis but still did not sleep that night. Over the ensuing days the patient became less paranoid, but he appeared increasingly distracted and his speech was more pressured.

Mr. Lopez’s work project was returned with multiple negative comments and requests for corrections. Instead of focusing on his editing, however, he stayed up late every night, intent on finding a cure for HIV. He made inappropriate, hypersexual advances toward other men at the gym, where he spent much of the day. He lost at least 5 pounds after deciding he should take vitamin supplements instead of food and his antiretroviral medication. He refused to go to the emergency room but finally agreed to come to his routine AIDS clinic appointment to show his doctors how well he had done despite not having taken his medications in over a month.

Mr. Lopez’s psychiatric history was without a prior episode of clear-cut mania, but he had been depressed as a teenager during the early phase of his coming-out process. That episode was punctuated by a purposeful overdose and a 2-week psychiatric hospitalization and treatment with antidepressant medication and psychotherapy. Mr. Lopez had discontinued the medication because it made him “hyper and edgy,” and he stopped the psychotherapy because “it was pointless.” He used methamphetamine frequently for several years, which led to recurrent unprotected intercourse with strangers.

Mr. Lopez was diagnosed with HIV at age 22, at which point he went to an outpatient substance use disorder rehabilitation center and discontinued his use of stimulants and alcohol. His lowest CD4 lymphocyte count had been 216 cells/mm3, when he was age 24, at which time his viral load was 1.6 million copies. He had been reportedly adherent to his antiretroviral medications since then. His most recent CD4 count, 6 months prior to this episode, had been 526 cells/mm3. His viral load had been undetectable. He had suffered fatigue but had not had any AIDS-defining illnesses. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain revealed mild cortical atrophy and periventricular white matter disease in excess of what would be expected for his age. The partner was unsure when Mr. Lopez had discontinued his antiretrovirals but thought it might have been months earlier. He also wondered if Mr. Lopez had “lost a step” cognitively over the past year.

His family psychiatric history was significant for a maternal aunt who had received lithium and several courses of electroconvulsive therapy, but her diagnosis was unknown.

On examination, the patient was a sloppily dressed young man who told a pressured, disjointed story of events over the prior month. He was difficult to direct and was uncharacteristically irritable and devaluing. He was preoccupied with having discovered a cure for HIV through multivitamins and exercise. He denied hallucinations and suicidal and homicidal ideation. He refused cognitive testing, and his insight and judgment appeared poor.","Bipolar and related disorder due to HIV infection, with manic features",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Clarifying diagnoses structure**

The user didn't specify a clear directive but mentioned wanting the ""top 5 most likely diagnoses."" This can include both comorbidities and differential diagnoses, but I need to be careful about contradictions, especially with bipolar disorders. They asked for a list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses, which suggests final diagnoses rather than alternatives. However, it’s tricky because ""top 5"" implies differential possibilities. I need to consider how to effectively use the F-codes to present this in a clear manner.

**Deciding on diagnoses**

I'm thinking about using secondary diagnoses to cover both comorbidities and differential aspects. My approach might be to provide a primary diagnosis for the current episode, like Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features. Then, for secondary diagnoses, I could note stimulant use disorder, but it's unclear if it’s in remission due to recent use. I could also consider coding for ""Other stimulant use disorder"" as moderate or severe, but it’s tricky since I don’t have confirmatory criteria within the past 12 months.

**Assessing stimulant use disorder**

Looking at his history, he used stimulants frequently for several years, which led to risky behaviors. After going to rehab, he stopped, but now he’s used once again. This suggests he might have stimulant use disorder; even if he’s not currently meeting the criteria, the diagnosis can persist with a remission specifier. However, since there's been recent use, he may not be in remission anymore, possibly entering ""partial remission,"" even though that isn't specified in DSM-5. I need to confirm if we have at least two criteria from the past 12 months for a proper diagnosis.

**Evaluating stimulant use criteria**

I’m considering his situation where he took meth even while in NA, which might suggest craving, but it doesn't necessarily indicate failure to fulfill major roles or use in hazardous situations. There seem to be insufficient criteria to diagnose stimulant use disorder. Perhaps diagnosing ""Other stimulant use, unspecified"" could work, but I’m unsure of its validity in the DSM. Given the complexity, I might classify it as ""Other stimulant use disorder, in sustained remission,"" taking into account his long abstinence but recent slip. However, his latest use may still count as a criteria for diagnosis.

**Choosing diagnostic codes**

His relapse suggests he might not be in remission. While he could meet some criteria for stimulant use disorder, it seems insufficient for a solid diagnosis. I could opt for ""Other stimulant use disorder, moderate or severe,"" but I'd prefer accuracy. Alternatively, we might consider stimulant-induced bipolar disorder, given his recent acute anxiety and paranoia after meth use, but that complicates things. The differential diagnoses include bipolar I disorder, substance-induced bipolar disorder, and HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder. I need to choose the five best-fitting codes, which might include the stimulant use disorder and possibly the alcohol use disorder.

**Determining psychiatric diagnoses**

I think it's essential to include neurocognitive disorder (NCD) due to HIV since it's clinically relevant, but I hesitate because the focus is on psychiatric diagnoses. Perhaps I could consider including ""Unspecified neurocognitive disorder"" but I'm not sure that's appropriate. I'm also reflecting on whether the mania could stem from HIV-related issues, but that seems less likely. My top five diagnoses might prioritize bipolar I disorder with psychotic features and stimulant use disorder due to the recent relapse. However, the challenge lies in determining the right coding and whether to include histories of substance use and mental disorders.

**Evaluating alternate diagnoses**

I need to consider less obvious possibilities for this diagnosis, including medical and substance-related factors. My top five diagnoses would likely include Bipolar I disorder and Stimulant-Induced Bipolar Disorder. I'm reflecting on whether to label the stimulant use disorder as ""in sustained remission"" or not—since he recently used meth after years of abstinence, this complicates things. While he might not meet all criteria for active stimulant use disorder, his history supports a diagnosis. I'll have to navigate these nuances carefully!

**Finalizing diagnostic summary**

If the individual has resumed using substances, he might meet some criteria again, but there's lack of clarity on frequency. Given that he used crystal methamphetamine after years of abstinence, this indicates potential recurrence of substance use disorder. While I could list diagnoses including stimulant use disorder in sustained remission, it's challenging because of his recent use. Ultimately, I've decided on five specific diagnoses that best represent the situation, ensuring to follow ICD-10 and DSM-5 guidelines closely. Each diagnosis correlates with the appropriate codes!

**Preparing final diagnosis list**

I’m focused on providing codes without any reasoning or disclaimers. Each diagnosis needs to connect accurately with ICD-10 F-codes. I’ll compile a list with five diagnoses:

1. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features - F31.2  
2. Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar and Related Disorder, with onset during intoxication (amphetamine-type stimulant) - F15.94  
3. Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition (HIV), with manic features - F06.33  
4. Mild neurocognitive disorder due to HIV infection - F06.7

99,"Ursula Norman, a 32-year-old nurse, was brought to an emergency department 6 days after giving birth. Her husband stated that she had been behaving very strangely and that she had become convinced that she had smothered and killed her baby.

Her husband reported that after a normal pregnancy and uncomplicated delivery, Ms. Norman had happily gone home with their first child. On the third day after delivery, however, her mood and affect began to shift rapidly between elation and weepiness. She became irritable and anxious. She slept only an hour a night, even when her baby was asleep. Her behavior became increasingly bizarre, with overactivity and agitation. Her speech was rapid and digressive. Although not previously a religious person, she became convinced that God was speaking through her and that she had special powers that could solve the problems of the world. She told her husband that she could identify evil people by looking into their eyes and had begun to worry that she was surrounded by evil people, including her own mother. Most disturbing for her, whenever she was out of sight of her son, she became totally convinced that she had smothered him, and no one could convince her otherwise.

Ms. Norman had a history of three episodes of major depressive disorder in her teens and early 20s. These episodes resolved with psychotherapy and antidepressant medication. She also had a psychiatric admission for mania 3 years prior to the delivery of her child, after a flight from Asia to Europe. Following treatment with antipsychotic medication, she became depressed for several months. Although a diagnosis of bipolar disorder was discussed at this time, she was reluctant to accept this label, attributing the episode to stress and jet lag. She had discontinued the psychiatric medication in anticipation of getting pregnant.

Ms. Norman’s own mother had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital shortly after the birth of her first child. This episode was not talked about in the family, and there were few other details. She had no other family history of note.

Until just before delivery of her child, Ms. Norman had been a highly functional nurse in a renal unit. Her husband was the head of a sales team, and they lived in comfortable social circumstances. She had no history of illicit drug use and, prior to pregnancy, drank only 2 or 3 units of alcohol a week.

On mental status examination, Ms. Norman wandered around the room, seemingly unable to sit for more than a few moments. She was distractible and overtalkative, and demonstrated flight of ideas, flitting from one subject to another. Her mood was labile. At times she appeared happily euphoric. At other times she was tearful, and she could become quickly irritable when she felt she was not being understood. It was clear that she had a number of delusional beliefs but was unwilling to discuss most of them with the examiner. She did insist that she had already killed her own child, which led to several minutes of tears, but she returned to an edgy euphoria within a few minutes. She denied intent to harm herself or anyone else. She appeared inattentive, with poor concentration, but would not participate in formal cognitive testing.

Physical examination and laboratory testing results were all within normal limits.","Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe, with psychotic features, with peripartum onset",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Examining a vignette carefully**

I need to build my internal reasoning for understanding this vignette. It features a 32-year-old nurse who arrived at the emergency department six days postpartum. Her husband is acting oddly and believes she smothered their baby. After some initial happiness following the pregnancy and delivery, her mood rapidly shifted to irritability and anxiety. She’s only sleeping an hour a night and showing bizarre behavior like rapid speech and grandiose delusions, feeling convinced that God is speaking through her.

**Analyzing mental health symptoms**

I’m thinking about the possibility of delusional guilt or infanticide delusion, suggesting issues like postpartum psychosis or severe depression. The history shows three episodes of major depressive disorder (MDD) in her teens and early twenties, treated with psychotherapy and antidepressants. There was a psychiatric admission for mania three years ago, and she's had trouble with psychiatric medication during her pregnancy. Her mother experienced similar psychiatric issues after childbirth. The mental status exam indicates psychomotor agitation, distractibility, and delusional beliefs about harming her child.

**Evaluating mental status and diagnosis**

The mental status exam doesn’t indicate disorientation, though she is distractible, which could relate to mania. She denies any serious issues. Both the physical exam and lab results are normal, leading me to think she has postpartum psychosis associated with bipolar I. While postpartum depression with severe MDD is an option, it generally lacks grandiose delusions and classic mania symptoms. Brief psychotic disorder is another differential, but given her previous mania history, bipolar seems more likely.

**Evaluating potential diagnoses**

I'm considering postpartum schizophrenia, which is rare, but at 32, it can be triggered. However, her primary symptoms lean more towards mania. Then there's the differential diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder vs. bipolar with psychotic features if psychosis persists outside mood episodes. I should also consider postpartum OCD, but her delusions seem more like firm beliefs rather than intrusive thoughts. My top five diagnoses include bipolar I with current manic episode and psychotic features, brief psychotic disorder, and recurrent major depressive disorder with psychotic features.

**Compiling potential diagnoses**

I’m tasked with creating a structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses that include ICD-10 F-codes. First, I’m considering bipolar I disorder with postpartum mania and psychotic features as my primary diagnosis. Then I should include brief psychotic disorder with postpartum onset, major depressive disorder with psychotic features, and schizoaffective disorder (bipolar type). Lastly, there’s psychotic disorder due to another medical condition. I can avoid listing historical conditions as separate diagnoses; instead, I’ll focus on acute and relevant episodes for this structured list.

**Organizing diagnoses list**

I’m focusing on creating a structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses with corresponding ICD-10 F-codes. Even though postpartum psychosis isn't its own diagnosis, I can attribute it to bipolar I disorder due to the recent manic episode. I’ll consider the following:

1. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe, with psychotic features, with peripartum onset - F31.2
2. Brief psychotic disorder, with postpartum onset - F23
3. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type - F25.0
4. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe with psychotic features, with peripartum onset - F33.3
5. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition - F06.2

**Clarifying bipolar diagnosis criteria**

I’m analyzing the diagnosis criteria related to potential mania and psychosis. Without hospitalization, the criteria for mania might not be fully met since she's at day 3 postpartum. However, given her symptoms, postpartum psychosis could still fit. I’m considering a list of potential diagnoses:

1. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features, with peripartum onset.
2. Brief psychotic disorder, with postpartum onset.
3. Bipolar disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features, peripartum onset.
4. Schizoaffective disorder (less likely).
5. Postpartum depression or general anxiety disorder seem unlikely too. 

This should give a solid foundation for a diagnosis.

**Listing diagnoses with codes**

I need to provide the top five psychiatric diagnoses with their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes, ensuring proper formatting without extra text or non-psychiatric diagnoses. 

1. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe, with psychotic features - F31.2  
2. Brief psychotic disorder - F23

100,"Victoria Owens, a divorced 58-year-old event planner, scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist for help with anxiety and depression. Ms. Owens arrived at the appointment well dressed and a little agitated. Speaking at a normal pace, she explained that her depressive symptoms had begun 2 years earlier in the setting of initiating divorce proceedings from her fourth husband. She described poor mood, incapacitating worry about her future, and poor concentration. These symptoms progressed to anhedonia, decreased energy, hypersomnia with interrupted sleep, passive suicidal ideation, and increased appetite with carbohydrate craving. She stopped going to work as an event planner and began spending most of the day in bed.

Ms. Owens initially sought treatment from a homeopath, who prescribed a variety of remedies that were not helpful. She eventually saw her internist, who prescribed alprazolam 0.25 mg three times a day as needed. This medication reduced her worry but had little effect on her mood. Her internist then initiated sertraline 50 mg/day, increasing the dosage (as tolerated) to 200 mg/day. Over the ensuing 2 months, Ms. Owens’s sleep improved and she no longer experienced suicidal thoughts. However, she became more anxious, irritable, agitated, and energized and noted that her thoughts moved rapidly. She denied impulsivity and psychotic symptoms.

Ms. Owens had a long-standing history of similar depressive episodes. The first such episode occurred during college, lasted for several months, and was untreated.

When specifically asked, she described multiple periods in her life when she had moderately elevated mood, rapid thoughts, and increased energy. It seemed that many important life accomplishments occurred during these periods. For instance, as a young, recently divorced unemployed single mother, she agreed to throw a bridal shower for her best friend. She pored over bridal and craft magazines, determined to create a fabulous party on a shoestring budget. She became totally engrossed in the project, seeming to have abundant energy and ideas. The shower was a huge success and launched Ms. Owens’s career as a party planner. She hid her mood swings from her clients and colleagues, leveraging her elevated mood states to project a high-energy “face,” but then would retreat and avoid work when her mood became low. She also became more irritable during these high-energy episodes, and she believed that each of her marriages both began and ended because of her tendency to “get emotional” when she was in these elevated mood states. Although these periods could last for many weeks, she did not experience changes in sleep, engage in risky behaviors, speak quickly, or become grandiose, and she saw nothing problematic about them.

Ms. Owens also reported that she drank heavily when she was in her 40s but rarely did so now. She denied prior suicide attempts and psychiatric hospitalizations. Her mother had been treated for depression with sertraline, and her brother was treated with lithium for bipolar disorder.",Unspecified bipolar and related disorder,dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Considering top diagnoses**

The question asks for the top 5 diagnoses. I think that bipolar II disorder should be the primary focus due to the description of episodes, historical context, and antidepressant activation. But I feel uncertain because some symptoms are missing. While flexibility in diagnosis is allowed, I wonder if the individual might meet criteria for hypomanic episodes. They could experience increased goal-directed activity and distractibility, but those symptoms weren't explicitly mentioned. It's a bit tricky to pin down.

**Diagnosing bipolar II**

As a clinician, I would still consider diagnosing bipolar II if the episodes indicate subtle hypomania. However, the vignette mentions ""multiple periods"" of elevated mood, rapid thoughts, and increased energy. Those are key features! Furthermore, terms like ""totally engrossed"" and ""abundant energy and ideas"" could suggest increased goal-directed activity, but I hesitate to label them as distractibility. Alternatively, she might fit within major depressive disorder, especially if those elevated periods could be just personality traits or normal mood variations. It's a challenging scenario!

**Exploring possible diagnoses**

The periods of mood swings lasting many weeks suggest something abnormal, like cyclothymic temperament. There’s also a history of heavy alcohol use, which could indicate alcohol use disorder in sustained remission. She experiences passive suicidal ideation but hasn't attempted anything, and she's divorced. Considering other potential diagnoses, I wonder if generalized anxiety disorder might fit due to her significant worry about the future. Persistent depressive disorder could also be a possibility given her long-standing depressed mood and symptoms like anhedonia and suicidal thoughts. It's a complex case!

**Clarifying potential diagnoses**

I’m considering several options here. Adjustment disorder doesn't seem to fit since the symptoms appear more aligned with major depressive episodes. Anxiety from medication isn't likely since alprazolam wasn’t misused. I briefly considered personality disorders, like borderline personality disorder, due to mood swings and relationship issues, but there aren't enough indicators like interpersonal instability. Other possibilities include hypersomnolence disorder, binge eating disorder, or unspecified depressive disorder. Ultimately, I think bipolar II, MDD with mixed features, and other specified bipolar are the most relevant. I need to prioritize those!

**Identifying primary and secondary diagnoses**

I’m settling on bipolar II disorder as the primary diagnosis due to its symptoms. I also think recurrent major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and other specified bipolar related disorders are plausible secondaries, with alcohol use disorder in sustained remission being another consideration. However, since bipolar II takes precedence, MDD is noted only as a differential. For the ICD-10 codes: bipolar II disorder is F31.81, MDD severe is F33.2, GAD is F41.1, and alcohol use disorder is F10.21. It’s important to clarify these before finalizing the list!

**Formulating the diagnosis list**

I’m mapping out the potential diagnoses, starting with bipolar II disorder as the primary one. The secondary diagnosis list might include recurrent major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder (due to sertraline), and alcohol use disorder in sustained remission. I need to ensure the ICD-10 codes are accurate: F31.81 for bipolar II, F33.2 for MDD, F41.1 for GAD, F19.94 for substance-induced disorders, and F10.21 for alcohol use disorder. I’ll keep it concise and focus on the top five most likely!

**Verifying diagnosis codes**

I’m confirming the diagnosis codes, starting with Bipolar II disorder as F31.81 and Major Depressive Disorder as F33.2 (severe, recurrent). Next is Generalized Anxiety Disorder coded as F41.1. I'm using F31.89 for Other Specified Bipolar Disorder and F10.21 for Alcohol Use Disorder in sustained remission. The final structured list should be organized without any reasoning or extra details, just like this: 1. Bipolar II disorder, current episode depressed - F31.81; 2. Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode, severe - F33.2; 3. Generalized anxiety disorder - F41.1; 4. Other specified bipolar and related disorder - F31.89; 5. Alcohol use disorder, in sustained remission - F10.21.","1. Bipolar II disorder, current episode depressed - F31.81  
2. Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode, severe without psychotic features - F33.2

101,"Wyatt was a 12-year-old-boy referred by his psychiatrist to an adolescent partial hospitalization program because of repeated conflicts that have frightened both classmates and family members.

According to his parents, Wyatt was generally moody and irritable, with frequent episodes of being “a raging monster.” It had become almost impossible to set limits. Most recently, Wyatt had smashed a closet door to gain access to a video game that had been withheld to encourage him to do homework. At school, Wyatt was noted to have a hair-trigger temper, and he had recently been suspended for punching another boy in the face after losing a chess match.

Wyatt had been an extremely active young boy, running “all the time.” He was also a “sensitive kid” who constantly worried that things might go wrong. His tolerance for frustration had been less than that of his peers, and his parents quit taking him shopping because he would predictably become distraught whenever they did not buy him whatever toys he wanted.

Grade school reports indicated fidgetiness, wandering attention, and impulsivity. When Wyatt was 10 years old, a child psychiatrist diagnosed him as having attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), combined type. Wyatt was referred to a behavioral therapist and started taking methylphenidate, which led to an improvement in his symptoms. However, by fourth grade, his moodiness became more pronounced and persistent. He was generally surly, complaining that life was “unfair.” Wyatt and his parents began their daily limit-setting battles at breakfast while he delayed getting ready for school, and then—by evening—continued their arguments about homework, video games, and bedtime. These arguments often included Wyatt screaming and throwing nearby objects. By the time he reached sixth grade, his parents were tired and his siblings avoided him.

According to Wyatt’s parents, he had no problems with appetite, and although they fought about when he would go to bed, he did not appear to have a sleep disturbance. He appeared to find pleasure in his usual activities, maintained good energy, and had no history of elation, grandiosity, or decreased need for sleep lasting more than a day. Although they described him as “moody, isolated, and lonely,” his parents did not see him as depressed. They denied any history of hallucinations, abuse, trauma, suicidality, homicidality, a wish to self-harm, or any premeditated wish to harm others. He and his parents denied he had ever used alcohol or drugs. His medical history was unremarkable. His family history was notable for anxiety and depression in the father, alcoholism in the paternal grandparents, and possible untreated ADHD in the mother.

On interview, Wyatt was mildly anxious yet easy to engage. His body twisted back and forth as he sat in the chair. In reviewing his temper outbursts and physical aggression, Wyatt said, “It’s like I can’t help myself. I don’t mean to do these things. But when I get mad, I don’t think about any of that. It’s like my mind goes blank.” When asked how he felt about his outbursts, Wyatt looked very sad and said earnestly, “I hate when I’m that way.” If he could change three things in his life, Wyatt replied, “I would have more friends, I would do better in school, and I would stop getting mad so much.”","1. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder
2. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, combined presentation",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Evaluating potential disorders**

I’m exploring different possible diagnoses. While there’s some physical aggression, there doesn't seem to be a pattern of rule-breaking, so conduct disorder might not apply. Major depressive disorder seems unlikely since he enjoys activities, even though he shows some irritability. He lacks symptoms of bipolar disorder or autism. I’m considering anxiety disorders, as he worries a lot and is sensitive. So, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) could be a possibility, but I need more details.

**Identifying potential diagnoses**

I'm considering other possibilities, like unspecified depressive disorder or ""Other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder,"" but DMDD feels more fitting. So my top five likely diagnoses would be: 1) Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD), 2) Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), 3) Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), 4) Other specified or unspecified anxiety disorder, and 5) Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) as a differential. While I know DMDD means ODD shouldn't be present, including it for consideration still makes sense.

**Clarifying potential diagnoses**

I need to avoid including contradictory diagnoses, so I shouldn't add ODD if DMDD is the main concern. I'm considering options, like ""Unspecified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder,"" if DMDD or ODD doesn’t fit. I could think about including ""Parent-child relational problem,"" but since they only asked for F-codes, I can't use Z-codes. I also thought about ""Intermittent explosive disorder,"" but it can't coexist with DMDD. So, I might rank DMDD, ODD, and IED in a differential list.

**Organizing possible diagnoses**

I need to provide a structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses, which sounds like it should include actual diagnoses rather than just differentials. They requested the top five most likely diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes, indicating they want both a primary diagnosis and four secondary ones. It seems those secondary ones might include differential or comorbid diagnoses, which feels a bit ambiguous. Yet, I can include mutually exclusive conditions while still considering their importance based on the provided information.

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

It seems I need to present a structured list of diagnoses based on the guidelines provided. I'm focusing on five likely diagnoses. The strongest picks appear to be Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder as the primary diagnosis due to the characteristic irritability and frequent outbursts. Following that, I’ll include Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, and Intermittent Explosive Disorder. Now, I’ll make sure to format each entry correctly with the corresponding ICD-10 F-codes.

**Clarifying diagnosis requirements**

I need to be cautious here, as the user specifically asked for a structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses based on the provided information. They want the top five most likely diagnoses without including extra qualifiers or details that weren’t specified. For ADHD, I can use ""combined presentation,"" but for the other diagnoses like DMDD and GAD, no specifiers are needed. I'll keep it straightforward and avoid any ""rule out"" or ""provisional"" wording. It's time to finalize that list!","1. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder - F34.81

102,"Yvonne Perez was a 23-year-old woman who presented for an outpatient psychiatric evaluation 3 weeks after giving birth to her second child. She was referred by her breastfeeding nurse, who was concerned about the patient’s depressed mood, flat affect, and fatigue.

Ms. Perez said she had been worried and unenthusiastic since finding out she was pregnant. She and her husband planned to wait a few years before having another child, and her husband made it clear that he would have preferred that she terminate the pregnancy, an option she would not consider because of her religion. He had also been upset that she was “too tired” to do paid work outside of the home during her pregnancy. She became increasingly dysphoric, hopeless, and overwhelmed after the delivery. Breastfeeding was not going well, and she began to believe her baby was “rejecting me” by refusing her breast, spitting up her milk, and crying. Her baby became very colicky, so she felt forced to hold him most of the day. She wondered whether she deserved this difficulty because she had not wanted the pregnancy.

Her husband was gone much of the time for work, and she found it very difficult to take care of the new baby and her lively and demanding 16-month-old daughter. Over the past several weeks she slept little, felt constantly tired, cried often, and worried about how she was going to get through the day. Her mother-in-law had just arrived to help her care for the children, and she thought Ms. Perez just had the typical postpartum blues that result from “hormones being out of whack.”

Ms. Perez was an English-speaking Hispanic woman who had worked in a coffee shop until midway through her first pregnancy, almost 2 years earlier. She was raised in a supportive home by her parents and has a large extended family. She moved to a different region of the country when her husband was transferred for work, and she had no relatives nearby. Although no one in her family had seen a psychiatrist, several family members appeared to have been depressed. She had no prior psychiatric history or treatment. She denied illicit drug or alcohol use. She had smoked for several years but stopped when she was pregnant with her first child. Ms. Perez had a history of asthma. Aside from a multivitamin with iron, she took no medications.

On mental status examination, Ms. Perez was a casually dressed, cooperative young woman. She made some eye contact, but her eyes tended to drop to the floor when she spoke. Her speech was fluent but slow, with increased latency when answering questions. The tone of her speech was flat. She endorsed low mood, and her affect was constricted. She denied thoughts of suicide and homicide. She also denied any hallucinations and delusions, although she had considered whether the current situation was punishment for not wanting the child. She was fully oriented and could register three objects but only recalled one after 5 minutes. Her intelligence was average. Her insight and judgment were fair to good.","Major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate severity, without psychotic features, with peripartum onset",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Considering depressive disorders**

I’m weighing different possibilities for a depressive diagnosis. Should I include unspecified depressive disorder, though that feels redundant? Generalized anxiety disorder comes to mind, but if symptoms aren’t reported over the necessary duration, it’s tricky. There’s insomnia disorder, but postpartum context is complicating. Maybe major depressive disorder with peripartum onset would fit better, specifically coding it properly. I should also think about postpartum anxiety or other specified anxiety disorders. So many nuances!

**Evaluating plausible diagnoses**

I’m considering five plausible diagnoses based on the data: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Adjustment Disorder, Other Specified Anxiety Disorder, Insomnia Disorder, and maybe Postpartum Onset? But postpartum psychotic features aren’t fitting. Symptoms include feeling worried and unenthusiastic since pregnancy and feeling overwhelmed after delivery. There's breastfeeding trouble and guilt from perceived rejection by the baby. Observing the mental status shows a depressed mood and slow speech since this has been going on for over two weeks, so it leans toward MDD.

**Assessing the diagnosis**

I’m noting that she had symptoms during pregnancy, which indicates peripartum onset. Since she’s three weeks postpartum, her condition could be classified. She’s participating in the evaluation well and showing moderate severity. I’m leaning towards Major Depressive Disorder as the primary diagnosis, categorized as a single episode with peripartum onset. Adjustment Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder could still be secondary options, though Generalized Anxiety is a bit uncertain, given her extensive worries and sleep disturbances since pregnancy.

**Exploring potential diagnoses**

I'm considering a range of potential diagnoses, starting with Persistent Depressive Disorder, though it seems unlikely due to the short duration and lack of prior history. Postpartum psychosis is another option, but she denies any hallucinations or delusions, making it less plausible. I’m also thinking about Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and trauma-related disorders, but they don’t fit well. Therefore, I'm settling on four plausible alternatives: Major Depressive Disorder, Adjustment Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Insomnia Disorder. We might also consider Other Specified Depressive Disorder.

**Finalizing the diagnosis**

I’m working through a range of diagnoses. First, I note that hypomanic episodes aren't present, so Bipolar II Disorder isn't a strong contender. Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features doesn’t fit due to the lack of those symptoms. I explore several alternatives, including Adjustment Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder, considering their symptoms. Ultimately, my final five diagnoses are: Major Depressive Disorder with peripartum onset as primary, Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Bipolar II Disorder, and Unspecified Depressive Disorder if criteria aren't met.

**Finalizing diagnostic list**

I’m putting together the final list of diagnoses. The priority is: Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, moderate, with peripartum onset (F32.1) as primary. Next, Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood (F43.23) is secondary, followed by Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1). The next is Bipolar II Disorder, current episode depressed (F31.81), and lastly Unspecified Depressive Disorder (F32.A). This final list meets the requirements without extra commentary.","1.

103,"Andrew Quinn, a 60-year-old businessman, returned to see his longtime psychiatrist 2 weeks after the death of his 24-year-old son. The young man, who had struggled with major depressive disorder and substance use disorder, had been found surrounded by several emptied pill bottles and an incoherent suicide note.

Mr. Quinn had been very close to his troubled son, and he immediately felt crushed, like his life had lost its meaning. In the ensuing 2 weeks, he had constant images of his son and was “obsessed” with how he might have prevented the substance abuse and suicide. He worried that he had been a bad father and that he had spent too much time on his own career and too little time with his son. He felt constantly sad, withdrew from his usual social life, and was unable to concentrate on his work. Although he had never previously drunk more than a few glasses of wine per week, he increased his alcohol intake to half a bottle of wine each night. At that time, his psychiatrist told him that he was struggling with grief and that such a reaction was normal. They agreed to meet for support and to assess the ongoing clinical situation.

Mr. Quinn returned to see his psychiatrist weekly. By the sixth week after the suicide, his symptoms had worsened. Instead of thinking about what he might have done differently, he became preoccupied that he should have been the one to die, not his young son. He continued to have trouble falling asleep, but he also tended to awake at 4:30 a.m. and just stare at the ceiling, feeling overwhelmed with fatigue, sadness, and feelings of worthlessness. These symptoms improved during the day, but he also felt a persistent and uncharacteristic loss of self-confidence, sexual interest, and enthusiasm. He asked his psychiatrist whether he still had normal grief or had major depressive disorder.

Mr. Quinn had a history of two prior major depressive episodes that improved with psychotherapy and antidepressant medication, but no significant depressive episodes since his 30s. He denied a history of alcohol or substance use disorders. Both of his parents had been “depressive” but without treatment. No one in the family had previously committed suicide.",Major depressive disorder,dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Exploring diagnoses options**

I'm considering the DSM-5's Section III, where persistent complex bereavement disorder can be categorized under ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder."" The ICD-10 code is F43.8. It’s interesting that while it’s not officially recognized, we could still code for it. I’m thinking about possible diagnoses like ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" or exploring others related to alcohol, but I really need to narrow it down to the five most likely options.

**Outlining potential diagnoses**

I’m looking at a 60-year-old patient who has a history of major depressive disorder (MDD) and is now experiencing bereavement leading to a major depressive episode. For the primary diagnosis, I’ll identify recurrent MDD. Secondary diagnoses could include adjustment disorder with depressed mood, mild alcohol use disorder, and potentially prolonged grief disorder, though that might be too early. I’m also considering PTSD if there's trauma involved. Ultimately, I need to narrow it down to four secondary diagnoses, focusing on those with F codes.

**Considering appropriate diagnoses**

I’m mapping out potential diagnoses and considering several options: recurrent MDD, adjustment disorder with depressed mood, and possibly other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder for ""acute grief reaction."" It seems the vignette focuses on grief versus MDD, so I should evaluate normal grief against prolonged grief and MDD. For clarity, I'd go with primary diagnosis as moderate/severe recurrent MDD and secondary diagnoses including adjustment disorder, PTSD, and mild alcohol use disorder. I’ll double-check the ICD-10 codes to ensure they’re correct, likely choosing F33.2 for moderate recurrent MDD.

**Selecting the right codes**

Alright, I need to solidify the diagnoses codes. For adjustment disorder with depressed mood, I’ll use F43.21—this seems clear. For other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder, I’ll go with F43.8, which fits persistent complex bereavement or subthreshold prolonged grief. That’s all set. For PTSD, I’m using F43.10, and for mild alcohol use disorder, I’ll choose F10.10, which aligns with DSM-5. But I’m still wondering if the alcohol use is actually mild. I might need to explore that further.

**Finalizing diagnoses options**

I'm diving into potential diagnoses for someone who has increased alcohol intake significantly. We’re considering major depressive disorder (MDD) as a primary diagnosis since he meets the criteria. For secondary diagnoses, I think ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder"" could work to capture persistent complex bereavement. ""Adjustment disorder with depressed mood"" doesn’t fit since it overlaps with MDD. “Alcohol use disorder” might not be strong enough, but we need a structured list of five likely diagnoses, even if they don’t fully meet criteria. It’s tricky!

**Determining diagnoses for grief and mood**

I’m recognizing his symptoms have worsened and he shows signs of pervasive depression and suicidal thoughts, which lead me to believe MDD is likely the primary diagnosis. I can additionally consider ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder"" for acute grief. ""Posttraumatic stress disorder"" may be a possibility due to the trauma of losing his son, but he hasn’t indicated avoidance behaviors. I’ll also include ""Alcohol use disorder, mild"" since he's increased his alcohol consumption, although it’s borderline. 

For five structured diagnoses, I’ll list: 

1. Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode, severe - F33.2
2. Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder (bereavement-related) - F43.8
3. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood - F43.21
4. Posttraumatic stress disorder - F43.10
5. Alcohol use disorder, mild - F10.10

I’m weighing their overlap but think it’s acceptable for differential diagnoses.

**Finalizing diagnoses for mood and substance use**

At two weeks, he struggled to concentrate, which likely persists at six weeks, indicating significant impairment, possibly severe. I’ll go with ""Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode, severe"" as the primary diagnosis coded F33.2 due to suicidal thoughts, even though the severity might be moderate (F33.1). 

I’ll list potential secondary diagnoses:

1. Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode, severe - F33.2
2. Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder (bereavement-related) - F43.8
3. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood - F43.21
4. Posttraumatic stress disorder - F43.10
5. Alcohol use disorder, mild - F10.10 

This gives a structured overview without unnecessary reasoning.

**Finalizing diagnoses and ICD codes**

Alright, so I need to present the top five most likely diagnoses related to the case. Based on the context and identification of symptoms, here’s my structured list:

1. Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode, severe without psychotic features - F33.2
2. Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder (bereavement-related) - F43.8
3. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood - F43.21
4. Alcohol use disorder, mild - F10.10
5. Posttraumatic stress disorder - F43.10

104,"Barbara Reiss was a 51-year-old white woman who was brought to the emergency room by her husband with the chief complaint “I feel like killing myself.”

Ms. Reiss had begun to “lose interest in life” about 4 months earlier. During that time, she reported depression every day for most of the day. Symptoms had been worsening for months. She had lost 9 lb (current weight 105 lb) without dieting because she did not feel like eating. She had trouble falling asleep almost every night and woke at 3:00 a.m. several mornings per week (she normally woke at 6:30 a.m.). She had diminished energy, concentration, and ability to perform her administrative job at a dog food processing plant. She was convinced that she had made a mistake that would lead to the deaths of thousands of dogs. She expected that she would soon be arrested, and would rather kill herself than go to prison.

Her primary care physician had recognized the patient’s depressed mood 1 week earlier and had prescribed sertraline and referred her for a psychiatric evaluation.

Ms. Reiss denied a previous psychiatric history. One sister suffered from depression. Ms. Reiss denied any history of hypomania or mania. She typically drank a glass of wine with dinner and had started drinking a second glass before bed in hopes of getting a night’s sleep. She had been married to her husband for 20 years, and they had three school-age children. She had been employed with her current company for 13 years. She denied illicit drug use.

The physical examination performed by the primary care physician 1 week earlier was noncontributory. All laboratory testing was normal, including complete blood count, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, glucose, thyroid function tests, folate, and vitamin B12.

On mental status examination, Ms. Reiss was cooperative and exhibited psychomotor agitation. She answered most questions with short answers, often simply saying “yes” or “no.” Speech was of a normal rate and tone, without tangentiality or circumstantiality. She denied having hallucinations or unusual thoughts. She described the mistakes she believed she had made at work and insisted that she would soon be arrested for the deaths of dogs, but she insisted this was all true and not “a delusion.” Recent and remote memory were grossly intact.","Major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate, with psychotic features",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Considering distinct diagnoses**

I'm focusing on the need for distinct diagnoses without any overlap. I can list differential diagnoses, starting with ""Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe without psychotic features,"" but that seems redundant. I’ll consider others like ""Adjustment disorder with depressed mood"" (F43.21) and maybe ""Alcohol use disorder, mild"" (F10.10). However, she only shows mild criteria, which complicates things. I might include ""Insomnia disorder"" (F51.01) as a comorbid condition, since insomnia can persist separately from depression, depending on context.

**Identifying likely diagnoses**

I’m considering the trouble with falling asleep and early awakening. It could qualify for insomnia disorder, but since it's due to depression, that doesn't fit. Maybe ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" (F41.9) fits, given the agitation but lack of worry. ""Suicidal behavior disorder"" isn’t defined in DSM-5-TR, but there are related conditions. I think I can list ""Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe with psychotic features"" as the primary diagnosis and then find four plausible secondary diagnoses to explore and rule out.

**Crafting differential diagnoses**

I’m working on crafting a list of differential diagnoses. First, I’ll note ""Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe with psychotic features"" as the primary. For secondary options, I’m considering ""Delusional disorder, persecutory type"" and maybe ""Brief psychotic disorder,"" although the symptoms aren’t present for the required duration. Another option is ""Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type,"" but evidence doesn't support it. ""Adjustment disorder with depressed mood"" seems less likely, while ""Bipolar II disorder"" (F31.81) is still a consideration despite denied hypomania. Lastly, there's ""Persistent depressive disorder,"" but the duration might not be sufficient.

**Considering differential diagnoses**

I need to take into account that the four-month duration implies some conditions may not apply. ""Depressive disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.31) could be a differential, though lab results are normal. ""Substance/medication-induced depressive disorder"" (F19) doesn’t fit here. For my structured list of top five likely DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses, I’ll include ""Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe without psychotic features"" (F32.2), even if it overlaps somewhat, but I’ll ensure to avoid duplicates and differentiate between psychotic and non-psychotic features.

**Creating a diagnostic list**

I’m putting together a list of top diagnoses to consider. First, we have ""Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe with psychotic features"" (F32.3). Next could be ""Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe without psychotic features"" (F32.2) if the beliefs are more about guilt. We can include ""Delusional disorder, persecutory type"" (F22) if the delusions overshadow mood symptoms. ""Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type"" (F25.1) might fit if psychosis occurs outside of mood episodes. Finally, I’ll consider ""Bipolar I disorder, current episode depressed, severe with psychotic features"" (F31.5), even if past mania isn't acknowledged.

105,"Crystal Smith, a 33-year-old African American homemaker, came to an outpatient clinic seeking “someone to talk to” about feelings of despair that had intensified over the previous 8–10 months. She was particularly upset about marital conflict and an uncharacteristic irritability with her mother-in-law.

Ms. Smith said she had begun to wake before dawn, feeling down and tearful. She had difficulty getting out of bed and completing her usual household activities. At times, she felt guilty for not being her “usual self.” At other times, she became easily irritated with her husband and impatient with her mother-in-law for minor transgressions. She relied on her mother-in-law for assistance with her children, but recently her mother-in-law appeared to be less available. Ms. Smith worries that she has become a burden to her mother-in-law. Her related guilt, in combination with her insomnia and fatigue, have made it very difficult for Ms. Smith to get her children to school on time. In the past few months, she had lost 13 pounds without dieting. She denied current suicidal ideation, saying she “would never do something like that,” but acknowledged having thought that she “should just give up” and that she “would be better off dead.” She decided to make an appointment after she attended her good friend’s wedding and found she did not enjoy any of it.

Two months previously, Ms. Smith had seen a psychiatrist for several weeks and received fluoxetine. She reluctantly gave it a try, discontinuing it quickly because it made her feel even more tired. She had also dropped out of therapy, indicating that the psychiatrist did not seem to understand her.

Ms. Smith lived with her husband of 13 years and two school-age children. Her husband’s parents lived next door. She said her marriage was good, although her husband suggested she “go see someone” so that she would not be “pacing and yelling at everyone all the time.” While historically sociable, she now rarely talked to her own mother and sisters, much less her friends. Previously a regular churchgoer, she had quit attending because she felt her faith was “weak.” Her pastor had always been supportive, but she had not contacted him with her problems because “he wouldn’t want to hear about these kinds of issues.”

Ms. Smith described herself as having been an outgoing, friendly child. She grew up with her parents and three siblings. She recalled feeling quite upset at age 10–11 when her parents divorced and her mom remarried. Because of fights with other kids at school, she met with a school counselor with whom she felt a bond. Unlike the psychiatrist she had recently consulted, Ms. Smith felt the counselor did not “get into my business” and helped her recover. She said she became quieter as she entered junior high school, with fewer friends and little interest in studying. She married her husband at age 20 and worked in retail sales until the birth of their first child when she was 23 years old.

Ms. Smith had not used alcohol since her first pregnancy, and she denied any use of illicit substances. She also denied past and current use of prescribed medications, other than the brief trial of the antidepressant medication. She reported generally good health.

On mental status examination, Ms. Smith was a casually groomed young woman who was coherent and goal directed. She had difficulty making eye contact with the white middle-aged therapist. She was cooperative but mildly guarded and slow to respond. She needed encouragement to elaborate her thinking. She was periodically tearful and generally appeared sad. She denied confusion, psychosis, hallucinations, current suicidal ideation, and homicidality. Cognition, insight, and judgment were all considered normal.","Major depressive disorder, moderate, with melancholic features",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Identifying potential diagnoses**

The task involves listing the top five diagnoses: one primary and four secondary. I need to consider comorbid conditions or possible rule-outs. The vignette indicates major depressive disorder (MDD) based on symptoms like depressed mood, diminished interest, and recurrent thoughts of death. MDD meets the criteria, but I’ll also explore other possibilities, like social anxiety disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, although the evidence isn't strong for those. I need to be thorough in this assessment.

**Assessing severity of depression**

I'm analyzing symptoms like restlessness, difficulty concentrating, and worry about being a burden. While insomnia might apply, it's often linked to depression. I see a possibility for major depressive disorder, particularly without psychotic features. The patient seems to face significant impairment, including weight loss and passive suicidal ideation, but she still functions in some capacity. Considering these factors, I’m leaning towards categorizing her condition as moderate or severe, primarily due to the number of symptoms and functional impairment.

**Determining diagnosis severity**

I’m considering whether the condition could be severe. It seems severe requires multiple symptoms and significant interference with social and work life. The patient has lost 13 lbs and struggles with usual tasks, suggesting moderate to severe. I might lean towards F32.2 for severe major depressive disorder since there’s no evidence of self-care issues or psychosis. Alternatively, I could consider recurrent moderate depression with F33.1, but there are no prior episodes. Adjustment disorder could be a secondary option, but MDD takes precedence here.

**Exploring possible diagnoses**

I'm considering various potential diagnoses but ruling out persistent depressive disorder since it hasn't lasted two years. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder isn't applicable either. Bipolar II disorder seems possible, but there are no signs of mania or hypomania. While irritability and pacing could indicate mixed features, they don’t suggest a clear case for bipolar. Cyclothymic disorder is unlikely, and depressive disorder due to a medical condition is ruled out as she reports good health. I need to ensure the top five diagnoses reflect the most likely options.

**Structuring psychiatric diagnoses**

I need to compile a structured list of the top five likely diagnoses. For the primary diagnosis, I’m considering major depressive disorder (single episode, severe without psychotic features - F32.2). Then, I’ll list generalized anxiety disorder (F41.1) and adjustment disorder with depressed mood (F43.21) as secondary options. I’m also considering persistent depressive disorder (F34.1), but it may not fit the duration criteria. Bipolar II disorder (F31.81) could be an alternative but seems less likely given the symptoms. It’s essential to list plausible diagnoses while following the required format.

**Evaluating depressive disorders**

I’m reviewing potential diagnoses for the user’s situation. Major depressive disorder (single episode, severe without psychotic features - F32.2) stands out as the primary. For secondary diagnoses, I’m considering generalized anxiety disorder (F41.1), adjustment disorder with depressed mood (F43.21), and possibly persistent depressive disorder (F34.1), though that doesn't meet the duration requirement. I’m also thinking about social anxiety disorder due to behavioral changes, but it isn’t a strong fit. I need to ensure I clearly list the top five likely diagnoses per the user’s guidelines.

**Determining depressive diagnoses**

I’m listing potential diagnoses based on the user’s described symptoms. I’ll begin with Major Depressive Disorder (single episode, severe without psychotic features - F32.2) as the primary diagnosis. For secondary diagnoses, I’m considering Persistent Depressive Disorder, Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood (F43.21), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1), and possibly Bipolar II Disorder as an alternative. The focus is to ensure all choices align with the clinical details provided, forming a coherent structured list of the top five likely diagnoses.

**Evaluating depression diagnosis**

I’m considering the user’s symptoms to determine possible diagnoses. I think the primary diagnosis could be Major Depressive Disorder (single episode, moderate - F32.1). Secondary options might include Generalized Anxiety Disorder or Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood. I could also look at Persistent Depressive Disorder (F34.1) and Bipolar II Disorder (F31.81). There’s some ambiguity around Generalized Anxiety Disorder, but symptoms of worry fit, yet it might also be part of the depression. I’ll finalize the structured list based on these considerations.

106,"Diane Taylor, a 35-year-old laboratory technician, was referred to the outpatient psychiatry department of an academic medical center by the employee assistance program (EAP) of her employer, a major pharmaceutical company. Her supervisor had referred Ms. Taylor to the EAP after she had become tearful while being mildly criticized during an otherwise positive annual performance review. Somewhat embarrassed, she told the consulting psychiatrist that she had been “feeling low for years” and that hearing criticism of her work had been “just too much.”

A native of western Canada, Ms. Taylor came to the United States to pursue graduate studies in chemistry. She left graduate school before completing her doctorate and began work as a laboratory technician. She reported feeling frustrated with her job, which she saw as a “dead end,” yet feared that she lacked the talent to find more satisfying work. As a result, she struggled with guilty feelings that she “hadn’t done much” with her life.

Despite her troubles at work, Ms. Taylor felt that she could concentrate without difficulty. She denied ever having active suicidal thoughts, yet sometimes wondered, “What is the point of life?” When asked, she reported that she occasionally had trouble falling asleep. However, she denied any change in her weight or appetite. Although she occasionally would go out with coworkers, she said that she felt shy and awkward in social situations unless she knew the people well. She did enjoy jogging and the outdoors. Although her romantic relationships tended to “not last long,” she felt that her sex drive was normal. She noted that her symptoms waxed and waned but had remained consistent over the past 3 years. She had no symptoms suggestive of mania or hypomania.

Ms. Taylor was an only child. Growing up, she had a close relationship with her father, a pharmacist who owned a drugstore. She described him as a “normal guy who liked to hunt and fish” and liked to take her hiking. Her mother, a nurse, stopped working shortly after giving birth and had seemed emotionally distant and depressed.

Ms. Taylor became depressed for the first time in high school when her father was repeatedly hospitalized after developing leukemia. At that time she was treated with psychotherapy and responded well. She had no other psychiatric or medical history, and her medications were a multivitamin and oral contraceptives. When offered several different treatments, she expressed a preference for a combination of medication and psychotherapy. She started taking citalopram and began a course of supportive psychotherapy. After several months of treatment, she revealed that she had been sexually abused by a family friend during her childhood. It also emerged that she had few women friends and a persistent pattern of dysfunctional and occasionally abusive relationships with men.",Persistent depressive disorder,dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Confirming diagnostic codes**

Okay, so I need to confirm some codes from DSM-5-TR related to trauma and stressor-related disorders. The specifics are 309.89 and 309.9 for the unspecified ones. It seems like ICD-10 has similar codes. I'm also considering whether to include recurrent mild major depressive disorder as a secondary option, especially if there are persistent episodes. I might lean towards unspecified depressive disorder, F32.A, especially since that's a relatively new addition. I want to determine the best fit for the user's situation!

**Evaluating personality disorders**

I'm considering various possible diagnoses for the user's situation. I could propose ""Other specified personality disorder"" or ""Personality disorder, unspecified"" if information is insufficient. However, ""Avoidant personality disorder"" (F60.6) seems fitting due to sensitivity to criticism and social inhibition. She's tearful with mild criticism and has few friends, which aligns with this diagnosis. I also looked into PTSD, but she doesn't show symptoms. I’ll assess if ""Persistent depressive disorder"" (F34.1) or ""Social anxiety disorder"" (F40.10) fit better.

**Determining potential diagnoses**

I'm weighing different diagnoses for the user's situation. I could consider ""Adjustment disorder with depressed mood"" (F43.21), but since it's chronic for three years, that might not fit. Instead, I’m leaning towards ""Persistent depressive disorder"" since it seems more suitable. I'm also thinking about ""Avoidant personality disorder,"" ""Social anxiety disorder,"" and possibly an ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder"" due to childhood experiences. I need to narrow it down to the top five likely diagnoses based on available data.

**Exploring personality disorder options**

I’m considering various differential diagnoses for the user. While we already have ""Persistent depressive disorder,"" I think about ""Adjustment disorder,"" but that may not fit well. ""Borderline personality disorder"" comes to mind due to unstable and abusive relationships, yet there aren’t enough criteria to support it. ""Dependent personality disorder"" and ""Complex PTSD"" also seem like options, but again, they fall short. I might explore ""Other specified personality disorder"" with borderline traits since she has dysfunctional relationships, though I need to clarify her behaviors further.

**Assessing potential diagnoses**

I’m exploring possible diagnoses for the user. ""Persistent depressive disorder"" makes sense given her lengthy low mood, insomnia, and feelings of guilt and low self-esteem. Apart from that, ""Other specified personality disorder with avoidant features"" may be relevant, but I want to stick to well-supported diagnoses. I’m also contemplating ""Social anxiety disorder"" and ""Avoidant personality disorder,"" although the evidence isn't strong enough. I may also consider ""Major depressive disorder"" as a differential but need to ensure these diagnoses are distinct. Overall, I must prioritize the top five.

**Determining relevant diagnoses**

I'm sorting through potential diagnoses, starting with ""Persistent Depressive Disorder"" as a strong candidate. I also consider ""Avoidant Personality Disorder,"" ""Social Anxiety Disorder,"" and ""Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder"" due to possible connections to her childhood experiences and relationship challenges. While ""Major Depressive Disorder"" might apply, I don't have enough clear episodes to confirm it. Adjusting my focus, I want to ensure I only include signs supported by her symptoms over the past three years.

**Identifying potential diagnoses**

I'm considering her symptoms to conclude appropriate diagnoses. Primary seems to be Persistent Depressive Disorder due to her long-term low mood, while secondary options might include Avoidant Personality Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder. There's also the possibility of an Adjustment Disorder related to her chronic job dissatisfaction or a Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder given her childhood experiences. Major Depressive Disorder could be relevant too, but perhaps it doesn't fully fit her current picture. I need to ensure these align with the available information.

**Listing diagnoses carefully**

I'm aligning with the instructions to produce a list of the top five likely psychiatric diagnoses based on the provided clinical vignette. My primary choice is Persistent Depressive Disorder (F34.1), with potential secondary diagnoses including Avoidant Personality Disorder (F60.6) and Social Anxiety Disorder (F40.10). I can consider Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder (F43.8) and Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Mild (F33.0) as options. It's essential to ensure the accuracy of these codes while keeping to the guidelines of listing plausible diagnoses.

**Providing structured diagnoses**

I’m focusing on creating a structured list of the top five diagnostic possibilities without any additional explanations. I’ll go with Persistent Depressive Disorder (F34.1) as the primary diagnosis. Then, I’ll include Avoidant Personality Disorder (F60.6), Social Anxiety Disorder (F40.10), Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder (F43.8), and Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent Episode, Mild (F33.0). Each diagnosis will align with the ICD-10 F-codes mentioned to stay consistent with the guidelines. It's time to finalize that list!","1. Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) - F34.1

107,"Emma Wang, a 26-year-old investment banker, referred herself to an outpatient psychiatrist because of “mood swings” that were ruining her relationship with her boyfriend.

She said their latest argument was triggered by his being slightly late for a date. She had yelled at him and then, out of the blue, ended the relationship. She felt despondent afterward, guilty and self-critical. When she called him to make up, he had refused, saying he was tired of her “PMS [premenstrual syndrome] explosions.” She had then cut herself superficially on her left forearm, which she had found to be a reliable method to reduce anxiety since she was a young teenager.

She said these mood swings came out of the blue every month and that they featured tension, argumentativeness, anxiety, sadness, and regret. Sometimes she yelled at her boyfriend, but she also got upset with friends, work, and her family. During the week in which she was “Mr. Hyde,” she avoided socializing or talking on the phone; she wouldn’t be her “usual fun self,” she said, and would alienate her friends. She was able to work when she felt “miserable,” but she did have relatively poor energy and concentration. She was also edgy and “self-pitying” and regretful that she had chosen to “waste” her youth working so hard for an uncaring financial institution.

When she was feeling “desperate,” she would be determined to seek treatment. Soon after the onset of her period, however, she would improve dramatically, return to her old self, and not find the time to see a psychiatrist. During the several weeks after her period, she said she felt “fine, terrific, the usual.”

She said the mood swings always started 7–10 days before the start of her menstrual period, “like terrible PMS.” Her periods were regular. She had premenstrual breast tenderness, bloating, increased appetite, and weight gain. Almost as soon as her period began, she felt “suddenly good.” She denied alcohol or illicit substance use and had no history of psychotic, manic, or obsessional symptoms. She denied any suicidal thoughts and any prior suicide attempts and psychiatric hospitalizations. She denied allergies and medical problems. She took one medication, her birth control pill. Her family history was pertinent for a mother with possible depression. Ms. Wang was born in Taiwan and came to the United States at age 14 to attend boarding school. After graduating from an elite business school, she had moved in with her older sister.

On mental status examination, Ms. Wang was a fashionably dressed East Asian woman wearing tasteful jewelry and carrying a designer bag. Her hair was slightly askew. She maintained good eye contact and was pleasant and cooperative throughout the interview. Her speech was normal in rate, rhythm, and volume. She described her mood as “generally good,” and her affect was full, reactive, and mildly irritable. Her thought process was linear, and she showed no evidence of delusions, obsessions, or hallucinations. She denied suicidal and homicidal ideation. Her insight, judgment, and impulse control were intact, although she noted a history of perimenstrual impairment in these areas.",Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (provisional),dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Considering diagnoses**

I'm weighing options for diagnoses, thinking maybe ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" F32.A is better than Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). It seems ""Other specified personality disorder"" F60.89 could be a fit, but Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is also strong. 

I’m considering a top five list including:

- Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (F32.81)
- Borderline personality disorder (F60.3)
- Other specified depressive disorder (F32.8)
- Generalized anxiety disorder (F41.1)
- Bipolar II disorder (F31.81)

I’m leaning toward ""Other specified depressive disorder"" if symptoms are cyclical.

**Finalizing the differential list**

I'm considering a differential list that includes ""Major Depressive Disorder"" and ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder"" to rule out, but the cyclical pattern suggests those may not apply. 

I need to finalize the output, ensuring it only contains the final list without reasoning. 

So, I'll adjust for potential minor details, like capitalizing ""Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder.""

108,"Frank Young, a 40-year-old business executive, was brought for a psychiatric consultation by his wife. While Mr. Young sat quietly beside her, she reported that a change had come over him during the last 6 months. He was either quiet and withdrawn or uncharacteristically irritable. He had begun to drink alcohol to excess in social situations, sometimes embarrassing her. He often came home late, or not at all, claiming to have been at the office. When away from home, he rarely answered phone calls and text messages. She wondered if he was having an affair. Mr. Young denied seeing anyone else and indicated he had just been having a hard time.

After his wife left the psychiatrist’s office, Mr. Young reported a great deal of stress at work over the last year as he tried to deal with industry-wide setbacks and personal financial losses. He said he felt down and depressed most of the time. He reported difficulty sleeping most nights, loss of interest in his wife and children, low energy, and feelings of failure and self-criticism. He had frequent thoughts of wanting to be dead and of suicide, but he denied any suicidal intent or plans.

When asked about the alcohol, he acknowledged that he had been drinking heavily for at least 6 months. When asked about other substances, he asked about therapeutic confidentiality and then acknowledged that he had been using cocaine several times per week for about 9 months. He kept his cocaine use from his wife because he knew she would be judgmental. In the beginning, cocaine put him in a reliably positive, optimistic mood, and he found that he could more successfully churn through large volumes of otherwise tedious and discouraging work. Although his work required some socializing in the evening, he also began to regularly go to bars in the evening just so that he would have a place to comfortably combine cocaine with alcohol. He craved the high from cocaine, went out of his way to obtain it, and spent a lot of time getting high that he would previously have been spending with his family.

When asked to clarify the sequence of work stress, cocaine use, and depression symptoms, he reported that he had felt worried and discouraged about work for a year, but the feelings of depression, loss of interest, irritability, insomnia, and low self-esteem had not begun until about 6 months earlier, 3 months after he had begun to use cocaine regularly. He experienced those depressive symptoms most of the day every day, whether or not he had taken cocaine within the last several days.

Mr. Young denied any previous episodes of depression, other mood or anxiety disorders, or suicide attempts. He drank socially. He had experimented with cannabis and cocaine as a teenager but had never developed a pattern of regular use or impairment until the past year.","1. Cocaine use disorder, moderate
2. Substance (cocaine)-induced depressive disorder",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Considering diagnoses for evaluation**

I think I need to create a plausible top 5 list of potential diagnoses. Possible options could be Cocaine Use Disorder and Alcohol Use Disorder. I wonder if I should include Major Depressive Disorder alongside substance-induced disorders, but that makes it tricky since I need five total. ""Other Specified Depressive Disorder"" doesn’t seem to fit either. Maybe I could mention Generalized Anxiety Disorder since the individual expressed worry and stress about work. It might be good to reflect differential diagnoses rather than definitive ones here.

**Listing potential diagnoses**

I should consider including ""Insomnia Disorder,"" although it might just be a symptom of depression or substance use. It seems relevant to think about ""Alcohol-Induced Depressive Disorder"" since heavy drinking coincided with the onset of depression, starting around six months ago. I could also consider ""Other Specified Substance-Induced Depressive Disorder."" However, I realize the user has instructed that I should only provide a structured list of diagnoses and their corresponding F-codes, so I’ll need to make sure to follow that guideline while keeping my reasoning behind the scenes.

**Deciding on primary diagnosis**

I need to determine which diagnosis to prioritize. If I choose substance-induced depressive disorder as the primary diagnosis, I might use F14.24 for cocaine dependence with a cocaine-induced mood disorder. However, since they requested DSM-5-TR diagnoses, ""Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder"" fits as well. The ICD-10 mapping is tricky because there's no direct F-code outside the substance section. Typically, you would code these mood disorders with the substance code, but I need to ensure I'm verifying the correct codes along the way.

**Verifying diagnostic codes**

I need to double-check the accuracy of my codes in ICD-10-CM. For cocaine, the relevant codes include F14.20 for uncomplicated dependence, F14.24 for dependence with cocaine-induced mood disorder, and others for various conditions like intoxication and withdrawal. DSM-5 uses ""use disorder,"" while ICD-10 still utilizes dependence and abuse codes, so I might go with F14.20 for use disorder. For alcohol, I have codes like F10.20 for uncomplicated dependence and F10.24 for dependence with mood disorder. Additionally, I should remember the codes for Major Depressive Disorder and Adjustment Disorders as well.

**Finalizing potential diagnoses**

I need to finalize the relevant diagnoses. For Generalized Anxiety Disorder, I’ll use F41.1. I realized that insomnia disorder is coded differently and typically doesn't use F-codes, so I'll avoid that. I can explore including “Cocaine-Induced Depressive Disorder” and “Major Depressive Disorder.” Plus, I might add “Alcohol Use Disorder” and “Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood.” Also, Cocaine Use Disorder seems relevant. I should ensure that the F-codes are assigned correctly as I finalize the top five diagnoses. This requires careful consideration of the details from the case.

**Determining primary diagnoses**

I'm checking the relevant codes for Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, which is F43.21. For Cocaine-induced Depressive Disorder, I might go with F14.24, as it captures both dependence and mood disorder. I’m thinking I could differentiate between Cocaine Use Disorder (F14.20) and Major Depressive Disorder (F32.1) based on the background information, but it’s essential to stay focused on the top five possible diagnoses without being redundant. I should also consider the likelihood of each diagnosis based on the patient's history and symptoms, ensuring a well-structured list.

**Analyzing depressive symptoms**

I'm contemplating whether the depressive symptoms could stem purely from Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) triggered by stress, with cocaine use as self-medication. Stress has been persistent, and he turned to cocaine for a boost, which could explain the pattern of subthreshold depressive symptoms leading to full-blown depression. However, since his symptoms appeared three months after regular cocaine use, I'm struggling to determine if they fall under substance-induced depressive disorder or an independent MDD. 

After assessing the timeline and severity, it seems reasonable to consider both diagnoses while focusing on MDD as primary due to the persistence of symptoms outside substance use.

**Evaluating alcohol use disorder**

I’m breaking down the criteria for Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) based on available information. Issues like spending time at bars and causing embarrassment to his wife indicate social problems related to drinking. He seems to meet at least two criteria, potentially making it mild AUD. However, it's tricky because there's no explicit mention of cravings or failure to fulfill major obligations. I’ll lean towards coding it as AUD mild (F10.10) since his drinking, albeit excessive in social settings, may not fully meet all criteria based on the details provided.

**Deciding on diagnoses**

As I review options for coding, I recognize that listing both ""Cocaine Use Disorder, severe"" (F14.20) and ""Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (cocaine-induced)"" (F14.24) might be inconsistent. It's better to select five distinct diagnoses that best reflect the situation. I think I’ll go with:

1. Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, moderate (F32.1).
2. Cocaine Use Disorder, severe (F14.20).
3. Alcohol Use Disorder, mild (F10.10).
4. Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (cocaine-induced) (F14.24).
5. Unspecified anxiety disorder (F41.9).

This way, I'm covering the primary concerns and avoiding overlaps.

**Determining diagnoses**

I'm considering whether to list ""Cocaine-induced depressive disorder"" as the primary diagnosis instead of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). I believe the user should have a comprehensive list, even if that includes some overlapping diagnoses. A possible set could be:

1. Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, moderate.
2. Cocaine Use Disorder, severe.
3. Alcohol Use Disorder, moderate.
4. Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (cocaine-induced).
5. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder or Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood.

This allows for a range of potential issues without contradicting myself too much.

**Assessing sleep-related diagnoses**

I'm considering whether to classify ""Cocaine-induced sleep disorder"" as part of the diagnoses. I can check the ICD codes for accuracy. Based on my understanding, F14.282 is the correct code for this disorder.

However, insomnia may result from various factors, making it tricky to diagnose independently. The DSM specifies criteria for insomnia, not clearly met here. My proposed diagnoses could be:

1. Cocaine Use Disorder, severe - F14.20
2. Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, moderate - F32.1
3. Alcohol Use Disorder, mild - F10.10
4. Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (cocaine-induced) - F14.24
5. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder - F41.9

This provides a balanced overview of the user's situation.

**Considering substance use diagnoses**

In this case, it's important to recognize that we can diagnose both ""Cocaine use disorder"" and ""cocaine-induced depressive disorder."" The DSM allows for concurrent diagnoses. I’m weighing which should be primary based on what’s central to the user's symptoms.

Given the situation, I might prioritize ""Cocaine Use Disorder"" since it appears to underlie many behaviors. However, ""Major Depressive Disorder"" is also a significant concern. If I’m focusing on mood symptoms, I may lean towards ""Cocaine-induced depressive disorder."" We need to finalize our top five diagnoses, ensuring clarity and coherence.

**Determining top diagnoses**

Alright, I've been thinking about the appropriate diagnoses. I want to focus on the following codes:

1. Cocaine Use Disorder, severe - F14.20.
2. Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, moderate - F32.1.
3. Alcohol Use Disorder, mild - F10.10.
4. Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder, cocaine-induced - F14.24.
5. Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood - F43.21.

I need to ensure my list is clear and relevant, prioritizing mood disorder as central. It seems that listing both substance-induced and regular mood disorders could be redundant, but including them helps capture the complexity of the situation.

**Finalizing the diagnostic list**

In ICD-10-CM, I could code ""Alcohol dependence with alcohol-induced mood disorder"" as F10.24 but for DSM-5-TR, I need to list separate diagnoses. For ""Alcohol-induced depressive disorder,"" the code is also F10.24, while ""Alcohol use disorder"" could be F10.10 or F10.20 depending on severity. 

To simplify this, I'll align with the DSM structure and include:

1. Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (cocaine-induced) - F14.24.
2. Cocaine Use Disorder, moderate/severe - F14.20.
3. Alcohol Use Disorder, mild - F10.10.
4. Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, moderate - F32.1.
5. Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood - F43.21.

This approach ensures clarity in my diagnoses and keeps everything organized.

**Organizing diagnostic priorities**

I need to develop a top five list of diagnoses based on the user’s input, considering both the primary and secondary diagnoses without factoring in reasoning. The patient presents with both depression and substance use.

Given the circumstances, my priority will focus on depressive disorders. The likely diagnoses are:

1. Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, moderate - F32.1.
2. Cocaine Use Disorder, moderate to severe - F14.20.
3. Alcohol Use Disorder, mild - F10.10.
4. Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (cocaine-induced) - F14.24.
5. Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood - F43.21.

This prioritization reflects urgency and symptom presentation.

**Finalizing diagnostic list**

It's essential for me to provide a structured list of diagnoses along with their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes, per the user's request. The instructions emphasize outputting only the list without any additional commentary or reasoning, so I need to ensure clarity and conciseness.

Here's the finalized list:

1. Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, moderate - F32.1.
2. Cocaine Use Disorder, moderate to severe - F14.20.
3. Alcohol Use Disorder, mild - F10.10.
4. Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (cocaine-induced) - F14.24.
5. Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood - F43.21.

**Creating psychiatric diagnosis list**

I need to provide a structured list of psychiatric diagnoses according to DSM-5-TR guidelines for the user. Considering the information given, the top five likely diagnoses should cover Major Depressive Disorder, Cocaine Use Disorder, and Alcohol Use Disorder among others.

I'll finalize the list as:

1. Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, moderate - F32.1  
2. Cocaine Use Disorder, severe - F14.20  
3. Alcohol Use Disorder, mild - F10.10  
4. Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (cocaine-induced) - F14.24  
5. Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood - F43.21  

I think this captures the necessary information clearly and concisely!

**Refining diagnosis options**

For the fifth diagnosis, I’m considering options. ""Alcohol-Induced Depressive Disorder"" (F10.24) seems relevant due to heavy alcohol use starting six months ago. It could contribute directly to the depression, making it more pertinent than adjustment disorder. 

However, I believe it’s essential to balance between identifying substance-induced disorder and primary diagnoses. 

I’ll finalize my list as:

1. Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, moderate - F32.1  
2. Cocaine Use Disorder, severe - F14.20  
3. Alcohol Use Disorder, mild - F10.10  
4. Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (cocaine-induced) - F14.24  
5. Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder (cocaine-induced) - F14.282  

This aligns well with the symptoms and provides a clear diagnostic direction!

**Deciding on primary diagnoses**

The persistent depressed mood suggests Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). However, based on the user's history, it’s essential to clarify whether his depression is induced by substances like cocaine or alcohol. The depressive symptoms appearing three months after cocaine use makes it plausible but not definitive. 

Given this ambiguity, I’ll finalize the list with the most likely diagnoses:

1. Cocaine Use Disorder, severe - F14.20  
2. Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (cocaine-induced) - F14.24  
3. Alcohol Use Disorder, mild - F10.10  
4. Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, moderate - F32.1  
5. Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood - F43.21  

This structured approach should reflect the nuances of the case.

**Deciding on primary diagnoses**

I’m weighing whether to set ""Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (cocaine-induced)"" or ""Cocaine Use Disorder"" as primary. Given that the patient is exhibiting depression, it’s important to determine which diagnosis reflects the root cause better. Depression is clear and concerning; it persists independently of cocaine use, but it could also relate to substance use. 

My final list of top diagnoses will include:
1. Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, moderate.
2. Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (cocaine-induced).
3. Cocaine Use Disorder, severe.
4. Alcohol Use Disorder, mild.
5. Alcohol-Induced Depressive Disorder. 

This selection considers both substance use and its impact on mood simultaneously.

**Finalizing diagnoses and ordering**

It seems that both heavy alcohol use and depression began around the same time, making alcohol-induced depressive disorder plausible. The patient mentioned that depressive symptoms started 6 months prior, which complicates things a bit. 

I propose this list of diagnoses:
1. Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, moderate - F32.1.
2. Cocaine Use Disorder, severe - F14.20.
3. Alcohol Use Disorder, mild - F10.10.
4. Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (cocaine-induced) - F14.24.
5. Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (alcohol-induced) - F10.14.

This way, I’m reflecting both primary depression and the potential impact of substances.

**Finalizing diagnoses for evaluation**

In evaluating the patient, they have a first depressive episode that began after cocaine use. Given that their symptoms persist regardless of recent cocaine use, it can be tricky to determine causation. I think we should prioritize the most definite diagnosis first, which currently seems to be ""Cocaine Use Disorder, severe."" 

Here's a proposed list of diagnoses:
1. Cocaine Use Disorder, severe - F14.20.
2. Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (cocaine-induced) - F14.24.
3. Alcohol Use Disorder, mild - F10.10.
4. Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, moderate - F32.1.
5. Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (alcohol-induced) - F10.14.

I believe this ordering captures the patient's situation accurately, balancing between what’s most likely and clinically relevant.

**Structuring the final diagnosis list**

I’m working on finalizing the diagnosis list for the patient. I’ve considered both ""Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (cocaine-induced)"" and ""Cocaine Use Disorder"" as possible primary diagnoses. Given the current evaluation, it makes sense to list:

1. Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (cocaine-induced) - F14.24
2. Cocaine Use Disorder, severe - F14.20
3. Alcohol Use Disorder, mild - F10.10
4. Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, moderate - F32.1
5. Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (alcohol-induced) - F10.14

This list captures the complexity while adhering to the user's request for a structured output.

**Finalizing the diagnosis list**

I need to ensure the codes are accurate for the diagnoses. For ""Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (cocaine-induced),"" the proper code is F14.24, while ""Cocaine Use Disorder, severe"" corresponds to F14.20. The list I’m crafting includes:

1. Cocaine Use Disorder, severe - F14.20
2. Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (cocaine-induced) - F14.24
3. Alcohol Use Disorder, mild - F10.10
4. Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, moderate - F32.1
5. Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (alcohol-induced) - F10.14 

This should reflect the complexity appropriately!","1. Cocaine Use Disorder, severe - F14.20

109,"George Anderson, a 73-year-old married man, was referred to a psychiatrist for an evaluation of depression after screening positive on the Geriatric Depression Scale during a neurology appointment. For most of the 2 years since his diagnosis with Parkinson’s disease, Mr. Anderson had coped well and continued to engage in many of his usual activities. His wife of 49 years noted that 1–2 years before developing Parkinson’s disease, Mr. Anderson had become somewhat less enthusiastic and motivated compared with his baseline personality, but not to the point of causing any concern or impairment. The only other neuropsychiatric symptom preceding his Parkinson’s diagnosis was his wife’s report that during the past 5 years he frequently “thrashed about” while asleep.

Three months prior to the referral, however, Mr. Anderson began to decline social invitations from family and friends. He reported that he had withdrawn socially because he had lost pleasure in things that used to excite him, although he denied persistent feelings of sadness or worry. He recognized that he was not his “usual self” and tried, to no avail, to give himself “pep talks.” He had worked as a high school science teacher until retirement at age 67, and reported having learned “the power of seeing the glass half full” from his students. He felt frustrated that he could not “snap out of it” for the first time in his life but was hopeful about getting professional help. He denied wishing for death, explaining that although he was not afraid of death, he wanted to enjoy life as long as possible. He added, “God does not give me more than I can handle. I can’t ask for a better family, and I have had a full life.”

Other new symptoms over the prior few months included increasing fatigue, impaired concentration and memory, unintentional weight loss, and sleep-onset insomnia. Further history on his more chronic sleep symptoms revealed that, around 3:00 a.m. or 4:00 a.m. on most nights, Mr. Anderson began violently moving his extremities and moaning as though in distress, all while still seemingly asleep in bed. He often awakened his wife with these movements and occasionally struck her in his sleep. She sometimes used a different bedroom because of this. When he awoke from such an incident, he was coherent and briefly anxious, often reporting that he had been dreaming of swimming or running from something.

His wife took over driving shortly after his Parkinson’s disease diagnosis, but Mr. Anderson was otherwise independent in activities of daily living such as paying bills and managing his medications. His wife described him as “maybe a little more forgetful” over the past few years, but neither of them was concerned about this mild memory loss.

Past medical history included prostate cancer (in remission), glaucoma, and gout. Labs from his recent neurology visit were unremarkable, including blood counts, serum chemistries, thyroid function, and vitamin B12 levels. Family psychiatric history was positive only for a granddaughter with ADHD. He denied past problematic substance use and all current substance use except two or three glasses of wine monthly. He denied any previous depressive episodes, psychiatric treatment, or psychiatric evaluations.

On mental status examination, Mr. Anderson was pleasant, cooperative, and interpersonally engaging. Resting tremor, shuffling gait, hypophonia, and bradykinesia all were evident at mild to moderate levels. He occasionally smiled, but his affect was difficult to fully gauge because of masked facies. He reported his mood as “blah.” There was no evidence of psychosis.

On cognitive testing, he had some difficulty on the Trail Making Test part B, figure copying, and word-list recall, the latter being helped by category prompts. On a standardized brief cognitive assessment, he scored 25 out of 30 points, which was in the normal range.","1. Depressive disorder due to another medical condition (Parkinson’s disease), with major depressive–like episode
2. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Sorting diagnoses codes**

I’m figuring out what psychiatric diagnoses are needed since they want specifically F-codes, but sleep disorders sometimes use G codes. They mentioned excluding non-psychiatric diagnoses that don’t use F-codes, even though sleep disorders can be considered psychiatric. Now, I need to focus on including only diagnoses with F-codes. I might consider mild neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson's disease, but I’m unsure if that aligns since it seems to use G31.84 in ICD-10-CM.

**Clarifying diagnostic codes**

I'm sorting through the diagnostic codes. G31.84 is linked to mild cognitive impairment, while DSM-5 refers to ""Mild neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson's disease"" which is 331.83. In ICD-10-CM, mild NCD due to Parkinson's might combine G31.84 with F02.80, which pertains to dementia without behavioral disturbance. But for mild NCD, G31.84 is probably correct, not F. I realize that DSM-5-TR uses F06.7, but that doesn’t fit either, since it’s also not applicable here. So, I can't include that.

**Evaluating potential diagnoses**

I’m looking into the cognitive testing results and noting some deficits, but overall it seems normal, so mild neurocognitive disorder isn't likely. Mild cognitive impairment could be a possibility, though it hasn’t been diagnosed. I might also consider adjustment disorder with depressed mood related to Parkinson’s disease, but symptoms resemble major depression more closely. F06.31, which is “Depressive disorder due to another medical condition,” fits. Ultimately, it’ll depend on criteria, but ""Major depressive disorder, single episode"" vs. depressive disorder due to PD both seem relevant options.

**Analyzing depressive symptoms**

I'm considering that depressive symptoms may result from underlying neurodegeneration rather than just a psychological reaction. According to the DSM-5, if mood disturbances stem directly from Parkinson’s disease, it aligns with “depressive disorder due to another medical condition.” It’s tricky to assert this directly, though the presence of earlier symptoms like prodromal apathy and REM sleep behavior disorder hints at the synuclein pathology affecting mood. Major depression can show anhedonia without sadness, and symptoms arose significantly after PD diagnosis, but the early mild apathy might not meet the criteria.

**Deciding on diagnoses codes**

I'm grappling with whether to diagnose “depressive disorder due to Parkinson's disease” or “with major depressive-like episode.” The symptoms present for three months likely fit the criteria for a major depressive episode, aligning with F06.32. Yet it’s crucial to confirm it's directly due to PD. I need five diagnoses with F-codes. We can include major depressive disorder or other specified depressive disorder, adjustment disorder with depressed mood, and maybe the depressive disorder due to another medical condition. However, sleep-related issues like RBD and mild NCD can't be included due to code constraints.

**Exploring potential diagnoses**

I'm considering various diagnoses for the patient. He exhibits no anxiety and struggles with anhedonia, which may suggest major depressive disorder (MDD). Other options include “depressive disorder due to Parkinson's disease” and “adjustment disorder with depressed mood.” There's also “unspecified depressive disorder” which captures subthreshold issues. I’m also contemplating “persistent depressive disorder” but doubt it applies due to insufficient symptoms. While he has sleep disturbances, including insomnia and RBD, I need to prioritize mood disorders with F codes for clarity in diagnosis.

**Identifying appropriate diagnoses**

I’m exploring various diagnoses, aiming for five that include F codes. I wonder if I can include “somatic symptom disorder” or “neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson's,” but I’m facing strict coding constraints. “Unspecified neurocognitive disorder” might work, or possibly “depressive disorder, unspecified” as it fits subthreshold issues. “Insomnia due to other mental disorder” is coded F51.05 and aligns with his sleep issues. However, I’m realizing I can't make up symptoms to fill gaps. I need to ensure accuracy with my diagnoses.

**Clarifying diagnoses for symptoms**

I'm considering the patient's symptoms like apathy and anhedonia, possibly linked to Parkinson's disease (PD). Could ""Parasomnia due to another medical condition"" work? However, the DSM often codes sleep disorders as G codes, conflicting with the user's request for F codes. Maybe I can include “Other specified sleep-wake disorder” with the F51.8 code, which aligns with his thrashing episodes. I must provide five diagnoses—while ensuring they have F codes and not create symptoms just to fit. It’s tricky to balance accuracy with the coding guidelines!

**Examining potential diagnoses**

The patient is independent in activities of daily living, but he exhibits mild memory issues. I’m considering ""Mild neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson's disease,"" which aligns with DSM criteria. However, the code is G31.84, and the user wants F codes. I’m pondering if I can categorize it as F06.7 for mild cognitive disorder, but it's tricky. There are various sleep disorders to contemplate too, like RBD, but it seems to fall under G codes rather than F. I need to focus on psychiatric comorbidities with F codes while ensuring I don’t compromise on accuracy.

**Assessing potential diagnoses**

The patient shows symptoms consistent with Parkinson's disease (PD), so attributing sleep issues to a ""sleep disorder not due to a substance or known physiological condition"" is misleading. I’m considering ""REM sleep behavior disorder"" as a diagnosis, but its code isn’t an F-code. However, using F51.8 might capture the essence. He exhibits features of RBD and mild cognitive deficits. I’m compiling a likely list of psychiatric diagnoses, mainly focusing on correspondences to F-codes while ensuring accuracy regarding his conditions.

**Evaluating psychiatric diagnoses**

This case might indicate mild neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson's disease (PD), but cognitive screening shows some deficits that suggest mild impairment. The thrashing episodes in sleep resemble REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), causing harm during dream enactment. Depressive symptoms are present, though he lacks a sad mood. It’s possible he experiences depression linked to PD, and we should consider multiple diagnoses. The focus might be on major depressive disorder versus depressive disorder due to medical conditions. I’ll compile five possible diagnoses to present clearly.

**Determining diagnoses for Parkinson's-related symptoms**

I see a pattern that suggests possible depression related to Parkinson’s disease, particularly with more anhedonia than sadness. The primary diagnosis might be ""Depressive disorder due to another medical condition (Parkinson’s disease)"" with a major depressive-like episode code (F06.32). For secondary options, I can list major depressive disorder, other specified depressive disorders, and adjustment disorder. Additionally, mild neurocognitive disorder and REM sleep behavior disorder could be included. I’ll ensure all selected diagnoses have F-codes.

**Choosing psychiatric diagnosis codes**

I need to clarify the task of formatting diagnoses, as there are specific requests about including parentheses and indicating F-codes. The main concern is whether I can use ""REM sleep behavior disorder"" while matching it to an F-code. It looks like I could list it as an ""Other specified parasomnia,"" but then again, that wouldn't be accurate. I think I should prioritize the most likely diagnoses while ensuring they have corresponding codes. 

For the diagnoses, I'm leaning towards major depressive disorder as the primary, with several secondary options including ""Depressive disorder due to another medical condition"" and ""Adjustment disorder with depressed mood.""

**Determining diagnosis codes**

I've been thinking about the patient's condition, specifically noting aspects like lost pleasure and decreased enthusiasm along with symptoms fitting apathy. While the DSM doesn't recognize an apathy disorder, I can consider it under ""Depressive disorder due to another medical condition"" since these symptoms may reflect depression related to Parkinson's. 

I need to ensure I list the proper diagnoses with corresponding F-codes. The final list likely includes major depressive disorder, along with a couple of secondary options like insomnia and REM sleep behavior disorder.

**Clarifying diagnosis codes**

I've been considering the insomnia disorder, especially in light of its potential comorbidity with depression. The DSM supports this type of comorbidity, so I think it’s appropriate to include it on the list. Codes might be tricky; I could use F51.01 for primary insomnia but the patient might not fit that. F51.09 seems better for insomnia linked to depression or Parkinson's. 

I'll create a list of top 5 diagnoses, focusing on those manifesting most clearly in the case. That should include major depressive disorder, REM sleep behavior disorder, insomnia, mild cognitive disorder, and a secondary depressive disorder.

**Evaluating diagnostic codes**

I'm thinking about how to accurately code REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). There’s potential to list it as a parasomnia due to a known condition, but it's leading me in circles because the specific codes don’t match perfectly with what I need. So, I might opt to label it as ""Other specified parasomnia"" with code F51.8, despite the confusion around its classification.

For the depression side, I’m weighing between major depressive disorder and depressive disorder due to Parkinson’s disease, focusing on which diagnosis is most fitting for the symptoms and context. Given the patient's profile includes several depressive features, I’m inclined to list ""Major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate"" as the primary diagnosis, while ensuring the other diagnoses are well-represented as I finalize the top 5 list.

**Selecting primary diagnoses**

I'm trying to determine the primary diagnosis, likely going with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) based on the given vignette and subsequent evaluations. It seems we need to differentiate between MDD, apathy, Parkinson’s cognitive impairment, and sleep disorders. I’m considering a concise list of five diagnoses with their ICD-10 F-codes. 

I can finalize this as: Major depressive disorder (F32.1), depressive disorder due to Parkinson's (F06.32), RBD (F51.8), mild neurocognitive disorder (F06.7), and insomnia disorder (F51.0). I want to ensure they align well with the user's request.

**Finalizing diagnostic codes**

I’m working through the best way to assign ICD-10 F-codes while ensuring we stick to DSM-5-TR diagnostic terms. For insomnia, F51.09 makes the most sense since it covers ""Other insomnia not due to a substance."" I need to have the final list contain clear and valid items. 

I'll go with these diagnoses: Major Depressive Disorder (F32.1), Depressive Disorder due to another medical condition (F06.32), REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (F51.8), Mild Neurocognitive Disorder (F06.7), and Insomnia Disorder (F51.09). This keeps everything aligned!

**Finalizing diagnostic labels**

I’m determining the best setup for my list of diagnoses using DSM terms and corresponding ICD-10 F codes. The main ones I'll use are Major Depressive Disorder (F32.1) and Depressive Disorder due to another medical condition (F06.32). 

I’ll also include REM Sleep Behavior Disorder labeled clearly as “Other specified parasomnia” (F51.8), Mild Neurocognitive Disorder (F06.7), and Insomnia Disorder (F51.09). This gives a clear and structured output without any unnecessary complexity. Let’s keep the focus straight and avoid provisional terms for clarity.

**Crafting final output list**

I’m finishing up the structured list of diagnoses for the user. For Mild Neurocognitive Disorder, I’ll note it as “Mild neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson’s disease” with a corresponding code of F06.7. Insomnia will be labeled as “Insomnia disorder” with the code F51.09. 

Here's the finalized list:
1. Depressive disorder due to another medical condition (Parkinson’s disease), with major depressive-like episode - F06.32
2. Major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate - F32.1
3. Other specified parasomnia (probable REM sleep behavior disorder) - F51.8

110,"Helena Bates was a 27-year-old single administrative assistant who presented for a psychiatric evaluation and treatment for depression. She had recently begun an intensive outpatient program after a first lifetime hospitalization for an impulsive overdose following the breakup of a 2-year relationship. She said she had been feeling increasingly sad and hopeless for 1–2 months prior to the breakup. About a month before her admission, she began seeing a new psychotherapist who told her she had “borderline traits” and “situational mood swings.”

During these 4–8 weeks, Ms. Bates’s mood had been moderately depressed throughout the day most days, with no diurnal variation and intact mood reactivity. She had recently gained about 10 pounds from “overeating comfort food and junk.” She denied prominent irritability or argumentativeness. She described her self-esteem as “none” and had found it hard to feel motivation or to concentrate on routine tasks. By contrast, sometimes she would have “bursts” of nonstop thinking about her estranged boyfriend and devising ways to “get him back,” alternating with “grieving his loss.” She described times of being flooded with strategies to regain his interest (including purchasing a full-page newspaper “open letter” to him) and recently found herself awake until 5:00 or 6:00 a.m. journaling or calling friends in the middle of the night “for support.” She would then “trudge through the day” without fatigue after only 2–3 hours of sleep. These symptoms began prior to her hospitalization. She denied drug or alcohol misuse and self-injurious behavior. Until this particular breakup, she denied a history of particularly intense or chaotic relationships, as well as a history of suicidal thoughts or gestures. Indeed, Ms. Bates seemed horrified by her own impulsive overdose.

Previously, Ms. Bates had seen a counselor in high school for “moodiness” and poor grades. She became “depressed” in college. At that time, she began escitalopram and psychotherapy, but improved quickly and stopped both after a few weeks. While in the hospital following her suicide attempt, she started taking vilazodone and quetiapine at bedtime “for sleep.”

Ms. Bates was the youngest of three children who grew up in a middle-class suburban home. She attended public school and a state college as “mostly a B student” and hoped to someday go to law school. She described herself as having been a “quiet, anxious” child and “not a troublemaker.” Her older brother abused multiple substances, although Ms. Bates said she herself had never used illicit substances. Her older sister was treated for “panic attacks and depression,” and Ms. Bates knew of several aunts and cousins whom she thought were “depressed.”

On examination, Ms. Bates was a pleasant, well-related, casually but appropriately dressed, moderately overweight woman, appearing her stated age, who made good eye contact. Her speech was somewhat rapid and verbose but interruptible and nonpressured. She had no abnormal motor movements, but she gestured dramatically and with excessive animation. Her mood was depressed, and her affect was tense and dysphoric but with full range and normal responsivity. Ms. Bates’s thought processes were somewhat circumstantial but generally coherent, linear, and logical. Her thought content was notable for passive thoughts that she might be better off dead, but without intent or plan; she had no delusions, hallucinations, or homicidal thoughts. Her higher integrative functioning was grossly intact, as were her insight and judgment.",Major depressive disorder with mixed features,dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Analyzing symptoms and behaviors**

I'm considering signs like increased or excessive involvement in risky activities. Buying a full-page newspaper ad could be seen as extravagant spending, but it’s not necessarily risky. An overdose indicates self-harm rather than mania. 

Now, decreased need for sleep seems present, along with racing thoughts and increased goal-directed activity, which points to 3-4 symptoms. However, she mentions having ""sometimes"" bursts, saying she found herself awake until 5-6 AM multiple times. I wonder if complicated grief plays a role, but the timeline doesn’t fit. 

It could be adjustment disorder with depressed mood due to her prior major depressive symptoms increasing before the breakup, possibly triggered by relationship issues. The stressor could still be those relationship problems.

**Determining major depressive disorder**

I’m exploring whether she meets the criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). To qualify, there need to be at least five symptoms for two weeks, including depressed mood or anhedonia. She has a depressed mood most days, weight gain and increased appetite, and insomnia, but she doesn’t show psychomotor agitation or fatigue. She has feelings of worthlessness, diminished concentration, and suicidal ideation. That gives her at least five symptoms, so she does meet the criteria for a major depressive episode (MDE). 

However, if we consider bipolar II, there's a chance of a hypomanic episode amidst the depression, but nothing is clearly defined.

**Exploring hypomania and other disorders**

I'm trying to determine if she shows signs of hypomania, which typically requires noticeable, uncharacteristic changes in functioning. She has exhibited unusual behaviors, like calling friends late at night and developing strategies, which could be noticeable. The duration isn’t clear, but it might be around a month. However, her mood appears predominantly depressed, even with periodic energy bursts.

This leads me to consider borderline personality disorder because symptoms like instability in relationships and impulsivity fit her impulsive overdose after the breakup. Still, she denies chronic emptiness, anger, and identity disturbances, which complicates things.

**Evaluating potential disorders**

I’m thinking about her preoccupation with getting him back, which could hint at fears of abandonment, but that might not be enough. It could suggest histrionic personality disorder due to attention-seeking behavior, but that doesn’t fit. There’s also a chance of dependent personality disorder since she is calling friends for support and devising strategies to win him back, although there’s no long-term pattern.

Cyclothymic and obsessive-compulsive personality disorders don’t seem applicable either. She denies mood disorders related to medication or substances. I wonder if “Unspecified bipolar and related disorder” applies, but her antidepressants and sleep meds complicate things. Insomnia disorder, labeled as G47.00, can’t be included, and while ""Suicidal behavior disorder"" is acknowledged in DSM-5, it's not official. Finally, ""Other specified personality disorder"" might be an option, but there aren’t enough traits to support it.

**Listing potential diagnoses**

I’m considering her symptoms and narrowing down possible diagnoses based on the information provided. We could include generalized anxiety disorder since she shows signs of anxiety, but it might not be strong enough. 

It seems likely to prioritize five key diagnoses: major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate, with mixed features; bipolar II disorder; borderline personality disorder; adjustment disorder with depressed mood; and generalized or unspecified anxiety disorder.

I should ensure the ICD-10 codes are correct for each diagnosis, like F32.1 for major depressive disorder and F31.81 for bipolar II. The adjustments to her situation will guide the selection of the top five diagnoses.

I'm considering various anxiety disorders for her, such as generalized anxiety disorder, which requires excessive worry for at least six months, but that doesn’t seem to apply fully here. Alternatively, unspecified anxiety disorder might fit better. 

Then there's the possibility of bipolar disorders or complex grief. I note her past episodes might suggest recurrent major depressive disorder but still remain cautious about qualifiers like duration and severity. I think we have to pinpoint the five most relevant diagnoses, focusing on the information at hand for accuracy.

I'm evaluating her symptoms and considering several potential diagnoses. She shows mood lability but without mood elevation, which rules out hypomanic episodes and means bipolar II isn’t primary. Major depression with mixed features seems most likely, but I need to verify that the symptoms don’t overlap with depressive criteria. 

I’m considering other conditions too, like adjustment disorder or borderline traits, though they may not be the best fit. I aim to finalize the top five diagnoses and ensure accuracy with the ICD codes. I'll stay focused on her reported symptoms throughout this process.

I'm trying to figure out the best diagnoses. It seems likely to identify major depressive disorder with mixed features as primary. I’m also considering bipolar II disorder and borderline personality disorder, but I might lean more towards ""Other specified personality disorder"" with borderline traits instead. 

The criteria don't fully align with full-blown borderline personality disorder, and I also need to think about anxiety. I need to finalize a clear list based on her symptoms and possibly include cyclothymic disorder as a secondary option. This is complex, but I’m focused on clarity!

I'm assessing a case that seems to involve impulsive behavior after a breakup, depression, and bursts of nonstop thinking alongside decreased sleep. I’m considering whether it could be ""Bipolar II disorder"" with mixed features or something else entirely, like atypical depression. She's shown improvements on medication, and symptoms like rapid speech and excessive energy might suggest hypomania, even if not clearly documented. There are complexities here with overlap between depression and potential hypomanic episodes. I’m weighing the merits of each diagnosis while recognizing the intricacies of the situation!

I’m evaluating a case where psychotic features indicate a manic episode, but they may not show simultaneous depressive symptoms. There’s a focus on episodes of elevated mood lasting four days, which doesn’t seem to apply here. Thus, I’m considering ""Major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate, with mixed features"" as primary and ""Bipolar II disorder"" as a secondary diagnosis. For my final list, I’m articulating the top five diagnoses, ensuring to adequately specify potential secondary conditions while keeping the structure straightforward!

I'm determining the diagnosis for a case involving moderate depression and a previous suicidal attempt. She exhibits symptoms like depressed mood, weight gain, and insomnia, which suggest a moderate level of severity. Based on this, I will structure the list of top diagnoses following the specified format: 

1. Major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate - ICD-10 F32.1  
2. Bipolar II disorder - ICD-10 F31.81

The patient’s mother and sister had been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and treated successfully with medication. A maternal uncle had committed suicide.

The current impairment’s onset accompanied the breakdown of Mr. Campbell’s marriage of 6 years. Two months earlier, his wife had filed for divorce, announcing that she would live in the distant city her work had taken her to. Mr. Campbell had expected to feel relief; he said his wife had been hostile throughout the marriage. He had begun to entertain fond thoughts of a coworker. Nevertheless, he felt “flat”—unable to imagine a future.

Closer questioning revealed that Mr. Campbell’s problems went beyond impaired cognition. He described apathy and diminished energy. Jazz was a passion, but he no longer attended recitals—although impaired concentration probably played a role as well. Listening, the psychiatrist noted probable retardation of speech. Mr. Campbell said that his employer had mentioned that he was “moving in slow motion.” The problems were worse in the mornings. In the evenings, Mr. Campbell noticed a spark of energy. He put on music and reviewed reports that he had ignored during the workday.

Mr. Campbell declined to characterize himself as sad. He was pleased that the marriage was ending. But the psychiatrist was struck by her own affect in Mr. Campbell’s presence; she felt glum, pessimistic, even weepy.

She questioned Mr. Campbell at length about depressed mood, changed sleep and appetite, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, and thoughts of death. None of these attributions, he said, applied. Nor had he had indicators of disorders that can be confused with depression. Between episodes of impairment, he felt and functioned well.

The psychiatrist decided that the problem at hand was close enough to depression to warrant treatment. Factors that influenced her decision included the partial syndromal presentation, diurnal variation, periodic recurrence, lack of future orientation, and her own empathic experience. She proposed psychotherapy centered on Mr. Campbell’s decompensation in the face of loss. He insisted that he did not see the impending divorce in that light. The two agreed on brief psychotherapy supplemented by antidepressants. Within weeks, Mr. Campbell was functioning at full capacity. During the treatment, the psychiatrist was unable to elicit evidence of depressive symptoms beyond those noted in the initial history. All the same, she was convinced that the impaired concentration was a sign and symptom of something very much like major depressive disorder.",Other specified depressive disorder (depressive episode with insufficient symptoms),dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Considering diagnoses for MDD**

I’m analyzing the distinctions between mild and moderate Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Mild (F33.0) involves few symptoms, while moderate (F33.1) shows significant functional impairment. The case suggests moderate since there's considerable work impact. However, I must avoid overinterpreting. The vignette indicates episodes lasting months, so moderate feels right. They wanted a structured list of top diagnoses, suggesting I can include alternatives for a differential diagnosis without implying comorbidity. I’ll list MDD as primary and consider others like adjustment disorder too. I need to identify the relevant ICD-10 F-codes.

**Deciding on depressive diagnoses**

I’m working through the classifications for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and considering options like F33.1 for moderate recurrent episodes and F32.1 for single episodes. I must select one primary diagnosis and can include secondary ones like Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood (F43.21) or Other Specified Depressive Disorder (F32.8). F33.1 is a solid choice. I also have to ensure I base the selection on the most likely diagnosis. Also, I'm reviewing DSM-5-TR criteria for Major Depressive Episodes.

**Analyzing MDE symptoms**

I'm considering the symptoms for Major Depressive Episode (MDE). The criteria include a consistent depressed mood, significant changes in interest or pleasure, and other physical symptoms like insomnia or fatigue. The vignette suggests a depressed mood, as the individual feels flat and struggles to envision a future. There’s also a noted lack of interest since they’re not attending jazz recitals anymore. I need to ensure these symptoms lead to significant distress or impairment for an accurate diagnosis.

**Evaluating symptoms for MDD**

I'm assessing the symptoms for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The patient may still enjoy music occasionally, but there's an overall decrease in interest. Psychomotor retardation is likely, as noted by slow speech and movement. I'm thinking about fatigue as diminished energy, and indecisiveness indicates a lack of concentration. I’ve identified four symptoms so far: anhedonia, psychomotor retardation, fatigue, and concentration difficulties. However, the patient denies having a depressed mood. The vignette implies “partial syndromal presentation,” which suggests not all criteria for MDE are fully met.

**Identifying potential diagnoses**

I’m reviewing possible diagnoses based on the case. The patient shows symptoms like apathy, flat affect, and decreased motivation. Although they deny feelings of worthlessness, their lack of future orientation might fit the criteria for MDD. The psychiatrist noted signs of depression that might not match the full diagnosis, suggesting an ""Other Specified Depressive Disorder."" For a structured list, I'll consider: 1) Major Depressive Disorder (recurrent), 2) Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, 3) Other Specified Depressive Disorder, 4) Unspecified Depressive Disorder, and 5) Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition as possible differentials.

**Finalizing potential diagnoses**

I'm sorting through potential diagnoses based on the case description. I can include ""Major Depressive Disorder, single episode"" as a differential, but I might prefer ""Unspecified Depressive Disorder"" as primary while considering MDD as secondary. Based on ICD-10 coding, I'll likely rank the diagnoses like this: 1) Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent episode, moderate (F33.1), 2) Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood (F43.21), 3) Other Specified Depressive Disorder (F32.8), 4) Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (F06.31), and 5) Bipolar II Disorder (F31.81).

**Considering diagnostic options**

I'm weighing potential diagnoses for the user. I can think about including ""Bipolar II Disorder"" to rule it out, but there's no hypomania present. Maybe we should list ""Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood"" or ""Major Depressive Disorder, single episode,"" but that feels redundant with recurrent MDD. If current episodes have been mainly cognitive, it’s plausible to assign ""Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, moderate"" (F33.1) as the primary. I need to narrow it down to the top five likely diagnoses while ensuring clarity on the patient's history.

**Finalizing diagnoses**

I’m focusing on the top five likely diagnoses. I’m thinking of listing ""Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent episode, moderate"" (F33.1) as primary. For secondary options, I’m considering ""Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood"" (F43.21), ""Other Specified Depressive Disorder"" (F32.8), and ""Depressive Disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.31). I can also add ""Bipolar II Disorder"" (F31.81) as a less likely but important option. I might swap a secondary for ""Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, moderate"" (F32.1) to cover uncertainty about recurrence. Let's finalize those codes!

**Selecting diagnoses**

I’m refining the top five most likely diagnoses based on the information provided. I initially look at ""Depressive Disorder due to a medical condition"" and ""Bipolar II,"" which feel less probable. Instead, I consider ""Adjustment Disorder"" but decide against it as there's no conduct issue. Even ""Prolonged Grief Disorder"" seems off since the father's passing was years ago. I finalize on ""Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent episode, moderate"" as the primary diagnosis (F33.1) and list the secondary diagnoses, wrapping up the ICD-10 codes accordingly. Let's stick to the structured format!

**Listing diagnoses**

I’m working on refining the secondary diagnoses list, feeling a bit jumbled with potential redundancies. Initially considering options like ""Major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate,"" but I agree it’s not necessary. So, I aim to pick distinct conditions, settling on ""Adjustment disorder with depressed mood,"" ""Other specified depressive disorder,"" ""Bipolar II disorder,"" and ""Depressive disorder due to another medical condition."" After careful consideration, I finalize the list with their corresponding ICD-10 codes, ensuring everything aligns with DSM-5-TR terminology without reasoning included.

**Deciding on diagnoses**

I'm trying to finalize the diagnoses list. For the primary diagnosis, I’m leaning towards “Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode, moderate” because of significant impairment. I’m also considering “Adjustment disorder with depressed mood” since the symptoms seem triggered by life stressors like a divorce. The final rankings are: 

1. Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode, moderate - F33.1
2. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood - F43.21
3. Other specified depressive disorder - F32.8
4. Bipolar II disorder - F31.81

113,"Logan was a 12-year-old boy who was referred to mental health care for long-standing anxiety about losing his parents and relatively recent fears about getting a severe disease.

Although his parents described a long history of anxiety, Logan’s acute problem began 5 weeks prior to the consultation, when he watched a television show about rare and fatal diseases. Afterward, he became scared that he might have a hidden disease. His parents reported three “panic attacks” in the prior month, marked by anxiety, dizziness, sweats, and shortness of breath. About that same time, Logan began to complain of frequent headaches and stomachaches. Logan’s own theory was that his bodily aches were caused by his fears about being ill and about his parents going away, but the pain was still uncomfortable. He insisted he was not scared about having more panic attacks but was petrified about being left sick and alone. These illness fears developed several times a week, usually when Logan was in bed, when he “felt something” in his body, or when he heard about diseases.

Logan had begun to suffer from anxieties as a young child. Kindergarten was notable for intense separation difficulties. He was briefly bullied in third grade, which led to his first panic attacks and worsening anxiety. According to his parents, “there always seemed to be a new anxiety.” These included fear of the toilet, the dark, sleeping alone, being alone, and being pestered.

Logan’s most persistent fear revolved around his parents’ safety. He was generally fine when both were at work or at home, but when they were in transit, or anywhere else, he was generally afraid that they would die in an accident. When the parents were late from work or when they tried to go out together or on an errand without him, Logan became frantic, calling and texting incessantly. Logan was predominantly concerned about his mother’s safety, and she had gradually reduced her solo activities to a minimum. As she said, it felt like “he would like to follow me into the toilet.” Logan was less demanding toward his father, who believed his wife had been too soft and overprotective.

Logan and his family underwent several months of psychotherapy when Logan was age 10. The father said therapy helped his wife become less overprotective, and Logan’s anxiety seemed to improve. Logan’s mother agreed with this assessment, although she said she was not sure what she was supposed to do when her son was panicking whenever she tried to leave the house or whenever he worried about getting a disease.

Logan’s developmental history was otherwise unremarkable. His grades were generally good. His teachers agreed that he was quiet but had several friends and collaborated well with other children. He was quick, however, to negatively interpret the intentions of other children. For example, he tended to be very sensitive to any indication that he was being picked on.

Logan’s family history was pertinent for panic disorder, agoraphobia, and social anxiety disorder in the mother. The maternal grandmother was described as “at least as” anxious as Logan’s mother. The father denied psychiatric illness in his family.

On examination, Logan was a friendly, articulate boy who was cooperative and goal directed. He was generally in a “good mood” but cried when talking about his fears of dying and getting sick. He denied suicidality and hopelessness but indicated he was desperate to get over his problems before starting high school. His cognition was good. His insight and judgment appeared intact except as related to his anxiety issues.",Separation anxiety disorder with panic attacks,dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Considering anxiety diagnoses**

It's better to think about including ""Generalized anxiety disorder"" as a differential or comorbid option, but I’m a bit unsure. I could consider ""Specific phobia"" due to the user's past phobias, or ""Social anxiety disorder"" because of sensitivity to being teased, yet it might not apply. Checking DSM criteria for separation anxiety shows he meets them. He has multiple worries for GAD, but lacks key symptoms. Maybe ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" could capture his generalized anxiety symptoms without meeting full criteria. For panic disorder, he has panic attacks but doesn’t worry about them.

**Evaluating anxiety disorders**

I’m thinking the typical answer would include Primary Separation Anxiety Disorder, along with secondary conditions like illness anxiety disorder, panic disorder, somatic symptom disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. It's important to align this with DSM-5-TR criteria. Illness anxiety requires at least 6 months, but the task might overlook this and treat it as acute. The prompt mentions long-standing anxiety about losing parents and fears of severe diseases, though the acute problem started just 5 weeks ago. This suggests his anxiety could have deeper roots.

**Finalizing possible diagnoses**

Hmm, in the DSM, I can't diagnose illness anxiety disorder if the duration isn't met, but I could list ""Other specified somatic symptom and related disorder, short-duration illness anxiety."" That might be the best fit. I’m considering panic disorder since he had panic attacks in the past and might meet the recurrent criteria, despite not having unexpected attacks. For the final five diagnoses, I'm still deciding, but separation anxiety disorder would definitely be one.

**Finalizing diagnostic codes**

I'm laying out the potential diagnoses: Other specified somatic symptom and related disorder (short-duration illness anxiety) - F45.8. For panic disorder, I’m considering if it should be coded as F41.0 or discussed as ""Other specified anxiety disorder (panic attacks)"" - which is F41.8. I also have generalized anxiety disorder - F41.1 and somatic symptom disorder - F45.1. I need to ensure I’m using these codes correctly. Double-checking the nuances of each code feels essential for clarity!

**Evaluating potential diagnoses**

I'm analyzing which diagnosis is more likely here. The vignette mentions three panic attacks in a month, suggesting panic disorder or panic attacks linked to anxiety. His first attacks were in third grade, indicating recurrent instances. However, it's unclear if they're unexpected or triggered. Although he isn’t scared of the panic attacks themselves, he worries about the consequences, which could suggest panic disorder. I’m also considering various anxiety disorders, including separation anxiety disorder and short-duration illness anxiety, given the provided information. 

I should focus on strong support for each diagnosis based on the data available and avoid unsupported claims. Let's see which ones are applicable.

**Finalizing diagnoses**

I'm deciding on a top five list of diagnoses. First is Separation Anxiety Disorder - F93.0. Next, I’ll include Other Specified Somatic Symptom and Related Disorder (short-duration illness anxiety) - F45.8. Then there’s Panic Disorder - F41.0, followed by Generalized Anxiety Disorder - F41.1, and Somatic Symptom Disorder - F45.1. I could consider ""Other Specified Anxiety Disorder (panic attacks)"" - F41.8 instead of panic disorder. However, I want to avoid overdiagnosing, especially given the context of separation anxiety.

**Refining anxiety diagnoses**

I'm considering whether to list ""Other Specified Anxiety Disorder (recurrent panic attacks)"" as a diagnosis. It might capture panic attacks that don't meet panic disorder criteria, but I'm unsure if that's redundant. The DSM allows for this if symptoms suggest an anxiety disorder. I think using ""Other Specified Anxiety Disorder"" could work for panic symptoms here. However, I should prioritize Separation Anxiety Disorder and possibly other appropriate diagnoses like illness anxiety, panic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder based on the available information.

**Analyzing anxiety diagnoses**

The case presents multiple anxieties, particularly regarding separation, illness, and various fears. While the illness anxiety likely lasts about five weeks, I'm considering diagnosing ""Separation Anxiety Disorder"" as primary. Other possible diagnoses include ""Other Specified Anxiety Disorder"" for panic attacks, ""Other Specified Somatic Symptom Disorder,"" and possibly ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder."" Concerns like fears of parents dying and health suggest Generalized Anxiety, but we need clear evidence for each diagnosis. Finally, I may include ""Panic Disorder,"" despite some uncertainty.

**Finalizing anxiety diagnoses**

I'm considering the possibility of ""Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder"" (OCD) due to intrusive thoughts and compulsive actions, but I don’t see enough evidence for that. Autism Spectrum Disorder might fit too, but his social skills suggest otherwise. ADHD doesn’t seem applicable either. The best contenders for diagnoses include ""Separation Anxiety Disorder"" as primary, followed by ""Other Specified Somatic Symptom Disorder,"" ""Panic Disorder,"" ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder,"" and ""Specific Phobia."" It seems we need to prioritize these based on evidence and typical presentations.

**Building differential diagnoses**

I'm considering different diagnoses now. Based on what's been presented, I can include panic disorder, generalized anxiety, and somatic symptom disorder. The user wants to construct a differential diagnosis list with a primary and four secondary diagnoses. It’s fine to have plausible options, even if they don’t meet all criteria. So I’m thinking of listing: 

1. Separation Anxiety Disorder - F93.0  
2. Other Specified Somatic Symptom Disorder (Short-Duration Illness Anxiety) - F45.8  
3. Panic Disorder - F41.0  
4. Generalized Anxiety Disorder - F41.1  
5. Somatic Symptom Disorder - F45.1

114,"Maria Greco was a 23-year-old single woman who was referred for psychiatric evaluation by her cardiologist. In the prior 2 months, she had presented to the emergency room four times for acute complaints of palpitations, shortness of breath, sweats, trembling, and the fear that she was about to die. Each of these events had a rapid onset. The symptoms peaked within minutes, leaving her scared, exhausted, and fully convinced that she had just experienced a heart attack. Medical evaluations done right after these episodes yielded normal physical exam findings, vital signs, lab results, toxicology screens, and electrocardiograms.

The patient reported a total of five such attacks in the prior 3 months, with the panic occurring at work, at home, and while driving a car. She had developed a persistent fear of having other attacks, which led her to take many days off work and to avoid exercise, driving, and coffee. Her sleep quality declined, as did her mood. She avoided social relationships. She did not accept the reassurance offered to her by friends and physicians, believing that the medical workups were negative because they were performed after the resolution of the symptoms. She continued to suspect that something was wrong with her heart and that without an accurate diagnosis, she was going to die. When she had a panic attack while asleep in the middle of the night, she finally agreed to see a psychiatrist.

Ms. Greco denied a history of previous psychiatric disorders except for a history of anxiety during childhood that had been diagnosed as a “school phobia.”

The patient’s mother had committed suicide by overdose 4 years earlier in the context of recurrent major depressive disorder. At the time of the evaluation, the patient was living with her father and two younger siblings. The patient had graduated from high school, was working as a telephone operator, and was not dating anyone. Her family and social histories were otherwise noncontributory.

On examination, the patient was an anxious-appearing, cooperative, coherent young woman. She denied depression but did appear worried and was preoccupied with ideas of having heart disease. She denied psychotic symptoms, confusion, and all suicidality. Her cognition was intact, insight was limited, and judgment was fair.",Panic disorder,dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Evaluating possible diagnoses**

I'm considering somatic symptom disorder and its main characteristics, which include distressing symptoms and significant disruption. It seems the duration would typically be over six months. I wonder if I might lean toward diagnosing an anxiety disorder, like generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder. However, the user’s concerns seem primarily about panic attacks, which doesn't quite align with the criteria for GAD. There may be other relevant diagnoses like adjustment disorder or agoraphobia to consider, but I'm leaning towards panic disorder as the best fit.

**Determining potential diagnoses**

I'm analyzing the possibility of nocturnal panic attacks as part of panic disorder. It seems I need to identify five diagnoses: a primary and four secondary ones, ensuring they fit F-codes. I’m considering including ""Panic disorder - F41.0"" as primary, and possibly ""Agoraphobia - F40.00"" since the user avoids driving and maybe other situations. However, driving isn't specifically listed in the DSM. Alternatively, ""Illness anxiety disorder"" could be a consideration, but the duration doesn’t align. I'll keep working towards a top five possible diagnoses.

**Listing potential diagnoses**

I'm focusing on using the DSM-5 criteria for diagnoses, but if something doesn't fit perfectly, I might categorize it as ""Other specified"" instead. It's important to provide a list of the top five likely diagnoses, including differential options, without fabricating information. So, I’m thinking of including “Panic disorder (F41.0),” along with “Illness anxiety disorder (F45.21)” and “Somatic symptom disorder (F45.1),” though the six-month duration doesn’t meet the criteria. Also, I could consider other specified disorders.

**Evaluating diagnosis options**

I'm considering whether ""Agoraphobia - F40.00"" might fit since the user avoids driving and social relationships possibly due to fear of panic in public. This avoidance could connect to agoraphobia, but I'm not convinced it's a perfect match. Another option could be ""Social anxiety disorder - F40.10,"" given the social avoidance, but the reasons aren't clear. There's also the possibility of ""Major depressive disorder - F32.9"" because of declining mood and social withdrawal, but the user denies depression. These thoughts are leading me to explore more about generalized anxiety disorder too.

**Analyzing diagnostic options**

I'm exploring several potential diagnoses, starting with ""Obsessive-compulsive disorder"" and ""Delusional disorder, somatic type,"" but I'm not convinced they fit. It seems the user exhibits signs of health anxiety, possibly aligning with ""Illness anxiety disorder."" I'm considering the user's preoccupation with heart disease as well. Options for secondary diagnoses might include ""Agoraphobia,"" though I'm uncertain if the avoidance truly meets criteria. There seem to be a range of depressive disorders to consider, too, alongside insomnia or generalized anxiety disorder. I must ensure each code is accurate in this context.

**Assessing diagnostic considerations**

I'm looking at the possibility of ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety"" due to impairment from panic episodes, but I also wonder about ""Specific phobia, situational type"" linked to her fear of panic while driving. The details indicate she's a 23-year-old woman with a history of panic attacks and health anxiety following multiple ER visits. 

The key diagnoses to consider include Panic Disorder and Agoraphobia, alongside Illness Anxiety Disorder, and possibly Major Depressive Disorder. I need to ensure that the selected diagnoses are accurate and well-supported while organizing my findings clearly.

**Evaluating potential diagnoses**

I'm considering the patient's fear of panic attacks and possible heart disease, which may align with agoraphobia since she avoids driving and exercise. But it's tricky; her fear isn't strictly about escaping, instead focusing on dying during an attack. Illness Anxiety Disorder seems relevant, as she fixates on heart disease but might not meet the six-month requirement. 

For our top five diagnoses, I think we could list: Panic Disorder, Agoraphobia (if criteria partially met), Other Specified Somatic Symptom and Related Disorder (F45.8), and possibly Major Depressive Disorder or Adjustment Disorder.

**Analyzing possible diagnoses**

I need to assess her decreased mood and panic symptoms. While she might not fully meet the criteria for depression, there could be an adjustment disorder in response to her panic attacks, but it's likely redundant since she meets panic disorder criteria. I wonder if ""Depressive disorder, unspecified"" could apply, but it has a confusing code structure. 

Considering ""Anxiety disorder"" options, I could include ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" for short-duration symptoms relating to her panic. We might also explore her avoidance behaviors linked to agoraphobia, primarily focusing on her panic disorder.

**Crafting probable diagnoses**

I need to compile the top 5 psychiatric diagnoses based on her symptoms. First, I see panic disorder as primary, but I can consider agoraphobia as a possibility due to her avoidance behaviors. For the secondaries, ""Other specified somatic symptom and related disorder"" could fit if her illness anxiety is short-term. 

It seems ""Other specified depressive disorder"" also applies due to mood decline and effects on social interactions. Lastly, ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" could address her persistent worries.

**Finalizing diagnoses list**

I'm working on confirming the top 5 psychiatric diagnoses based on her symptoms. I clearly see panic disorder as the primary diagnosis, with agoraphobia being plausible due to her avoidance behaviors. 

For the secondary diagnoses, I think “Other specified somatic symptom and related disorder” fits due to her illness anxiety. “Other specified depressive disorder” seems appropriate given her mood and social withdrawal. Lastly, I might include insomnia disorder as a comorbid concern, although it's not chronic. So the final list could be:  
1. Panic disorder - F41.0  
2. Agoraphobia - F40.00  
3. Other specified somatic symptom and related disorder (short-duration illness anxiety) - F45.8  
4. Other specified depressive disorder - F32.8  
5. Insomnia disorder - F51.01

**Preparing diagnosis list**

I'm refining the top 5 psychiatric diagnoses based on the provided case details. Panic disorder is clearly the primary diagnosis, and agoraphobia is plausible given her avoidance behaviors. For the secondary diagnoses, I can include “Other specified somatic symptom and related disorder” for her health anxiety. “Other specified depressive disorder” fits due to her mood issues, and I’m considering insomnia, though it’s not strongly supported. 

Here’s the final list:  
1. Panic disorder - F41.0  
2. Agoraphobia - F40.00  
3. Other specified somatic symptom and related disorder - F45.8  
4. Other specified depressive disorder - F32.8  
5. Insomnia disorder - F51.01

**Finalizing diagnosis codes**

I’m refining the selection of diagnoses based on the information and ensuring they align with F codes. Panic disorder is a clear choice, as is “Other specified somatic symptom and related disorder.” Agoraphobia is a potential secondary diagnosis but may lack specific details required. I’ve decided against insomnia disorder since it generally falls under G codes, not F codes. 

Here’s the final list:  
1. Panic disorder - F41.0  
2. Other specified somatic symptom and related disorder - F45.8  
3. Agoraphobia - F40.00  
4. Other specified depressive disorder - F32.8  
5. Insomnia disorder - F51.01

**Selecting relevant diagnoses**

I need to be careful not to include insomnia disorder and focus on diagnoses related to F codes. I’m considering potential secondary diagnoses, including “Unspecified depressive disorder” and “Other specified anxiety disorder,"" both of which have relevant F code. I’m deciding the final list of top diagnoses based on relevance to the case: Panic disorder and Agoraphobia make the prime list, while Other specified somatic symptom disorder and Other specified depressive disorder also fit well. I'll finalize:

1. Panic disorder - F41.0  
2. Agoraphobia - F40.00  
3. Other specified somatic symptom and related disorder - F45.8  
4. Other specified depressive disorder - F32.8  
5. Unspecified anxiety disorder - F41.9

**Evaluating potential diagnoses**

I’m evaluating the possible diagnoses, starting with delusional disorder, which is low likelihood due to her age and the nature of her beliefs. Somatic symptom disorder requires six months, which she doesn’t meet right now. Illness anxiety disorder might be relevant but also needs a duration of six months. Generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and specific phobias don’t fit her case.

I’ll compile a final list based on what’s most likely: 

1. Panic disorder - F41.0  
2. Agoraphobia - F40.00  
3. Other specified somatic symptom and related disorder - F45.8  
4. Other specified depressive disorder - F32.8  
5. Specific phobia, situational type - F40.248

115,"Nadine was a 15-year-old girl whose mother brought her for a psychiatric evaluation to help with her long-standing shyness.

Although Nadine was initially reluctant to say much about herself, she said she felt constantly tense. She added that the anxiety had been “really bad” for several years and was often accompanied by episodes of dizziness and crying. She was generally unable to speak in any situation outside of her home or school classes. She refused to leave her house alone for fear of being forced to interact with someone. She was especially anxious around other teenagers, but she had also become “too nervous” to speak to adult neighbors she had known for years. She said it felt impossible to walk into a restaurant and order from “a stranger at the counter” for fear of being humiliated. She also felt constantly on her guard, needing to avoid the possibility of getting attacked, a strategy that really only worked when she was alone in her home.

Nadine tried to conceal her crippling anxiety from her parents, typically telling them that she “just didn’t feel like” going out. Feeling trapped and incompetent, Nadine said she contemplated suicide “all the time.” In the month before her mother finally brought her in for a psychiatric evaluation, Nadine had begun to cut herself on her thighs to “feel pain and relieve stress.” No one in the family was aware of this development.

Nadine had always been “shy” and had been teased at recess since she started kindergarten. The teasing had escalated to outright bullying by the time she was in seventh grade. The bullying took on a cultural/racially motivated undertone; Nadine and her family were of a different ethnicity than the vast majority of her schoolmates. For 2 years, day after difficult day, Nadine’s peers turned on her “like a snarling wolf pack,” calling her “stupid,” “ugly,” and “crazy.” Not infrequently, one of them would stare at her and tell her she would be better off committing suicide. One girl (the ringleader, as well as a former elementary school chum) hit Nadine on one occasion, giving her a black eye. Nadine did not fight back. This event was witnessed by an adult neighbor, who told Nadine’s mother. When Nadine’s mother asked her about the incident, Nadine denied it, saying she had “fallen” on the street. She did, however, mention to her mother “in passing” that she wanted to switch schools, but her delivery was so offhand that at the time, her mother casually advised against the switch. Nadine suffered on, sobbing herself to sleep most nights and wishing that she would not wake up.

Full of hope and ideas of escape from the bullies and their narrowness, Nadine transferred to a specialty arts high school for ninth grade. Although the bullying ceased, her anxiety symptoms paradoxically worsened. She felt even more unable to venture into public spaces and felt increasingly embarrassed by her inability to develop the sort of independence typical of a 15-year-old. She said she had begun to spend whole weekends “trapped” in her home and had become scared to even read by herself in the local park. Nadine’s social anxiety had evolved into true agoraphobia. She had nightly nightmares about the bullies in her old school. Her preoccupation with suicide grew.

Her parents had thought she would outgrow being shy and sought psychiatric help for her only after a teacher remarked that her anxiety and social isolation were keeping her from making the sort of grades and doing the sort of extracurricular activities that were necessary to get into a good college.

Nadine described her mother as loud, excitable, aggressive, and “a little frightening.” Her father was a successful tax attorney who worked long hours. Nadine described him as shy in social situations (“He’s more like me”). Nadine said she and her father sometimes joked that the goal of any evening was to avoid tipping the mother into a rage. Nadine added that she “never wanted to be anything like her mother.”","1. Social anxiety disorder, severe

3. Agoraphobia, severe",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Analyzing selective mutism and anxiety**

I'm considering the idea that performance demands and the class environment might play a role here. Selective mutism generally involves failure to speak in certain social situations, often at school, but the refusal to leave the house alone suggests a broader issue. 

Actually, while selective mutism is classified separately in the DSM-5, it can be linked to social anxiety disorder, among other diagnoses. I should focus on the top five diagnoses, including social anxiety, agoraphobia, trauma-related issues, and major depressive disorder. I'm also thinking about panic symptoms, but it seems dizziness doesn’t necessarily mean panic disorder.

**Considering agoraphobia and social anxiety**

I'm thinking that there might be a panic attacks specifier, though it wasn’t explicitly asked. The fear of leaving the house alone likely ties into social anxiety, but it could also point to agoraphobia. This condition involves anxiety in specific situations, like using public transport or being outside alone. It seems she can't handle being in restaurants or lines, indicating fear of embarrassment or humiliation. The DSM-5 mentions fear of not being able to escape or find help in these situations. So, it looks like there’s a lot to unpack here!

**Evaluating social anxiety and trauma**

I'm considering the fear of humiliation from not being able to speak. It definitely makes sense as an embarrassment factor. It's tricky figuring out the primary issue; it seems like long-standing social anxiety came first, leading to later agoraphobia. The user's nightly nightmares about bullies hint at deeper trauma, and even though the bullying ended, symptoms seem to worsen. While repeated bullying may not meet Criterion A for PTSD, physical assault, like the incident that left a black eye, might. This could make PTSD a plausible diagnosis as well.

**Assessing depressive and anxiety disorders**

I'm considering the possibility of Persistent Depressive Disorder or Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) due to chronic suicidal thoughts and a consistently low mood. But, without clear evidence of a depressed mood lasting most of the day for two weeks, diagnosing her with MDD is tricky. Her feelings of incompetence and sobbing herself to sleep suggest depression, but suicidal ideation can also link to anxiety and trauma.

Given her self-injury and pervasive suicidal thoughts, it seems likely that depression is comorbid. However, without distinct episodes or symptoms like anhedonia, sleep, or appetite changes, I might lean towards Unspecified or Other Specified Depressive Disorder. I should also consider Generalized Anxiety Disorder since she experiences ongoing tension and worry about social interactions.

**Evaluating anxiety and related disorders**

I'm considering whether she might have Separation Anxiety Disorder, but it seems more related to social interactions rather than separation from caregivers. Specific Phobia could apply, but Social Anxiety fits better. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder doesn’t seem relevant, nor does Autism Spectrum Disorder since she can interact and desires independence.

Selective Mutism is also a possibility because of her inability to speak outside specific settings. Her severe social anxiety fits the criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder, and Agoraphobia seems likely too. I’ll weigh these against PTSD and depressive disorders as key diagnoses, making sure to rank them by likelihood.

**Analyzing mental health criteria**

I’m reviewing the criteria for Selective Mutism, which requires a failure to speak in specific social situations where speaking is expected, and it seems to fit her case. While she can speak at home and in school, her inability to do so outside those contexts aligns with the criteria. 

However, it's also possible her severe social anxiety might be driving this inability to speak. Regarding depression, though she exhibits signs like suicidal ideation and feeling trapped, we may need more information to label it as Major Depressive Disorder. We should explore the potential for PTSD as well, especially considering her experiences with bullying and physical assault, but we need to adhere to DSM-5 criteria carefully. Lastly, we could also consider Generalized Anxiety Disorder given her constant tension and worry.

**Determining top diagnoses**

I need to identify the top 5 most likely DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses with their ICD-10 F-codes. Given the severity of her social anxiety and significant functional impairment, I think the primary diagnosis should be Social Anxiety Disorder, which corresponds to F40.10. 

For the secondary diagnoses, we might consider Selective Mutism (F94.0), Agoraphobia (F40.00), Unspecified Depressive Disorder (F32.A), and possibly PTSD (F43.10) due to her nightmares and hypervigilance.

**Listing diagnoses**

I need to provide the top 5 likely DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses with their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes. Here’s what I’ve decided:

1. Social anxiety disorder (social phobia) - F40.10  
2. Agoraphobia - F40.00  
3. Selective mutism - F94.0  
4. Posttraumatic stress disorder - F43.10  
5. Unspecified depressive disorder - F32.A  

This list reflects the most relevant diagnoses based on the information given, focusing on their clinical implications.

**Finalizing the list**

I need to include the top 5 psychiatric diagnoses with their ICD-10 F-codes without any reasoning. Here’s the structured output:

1. Social anxiety disorder (social phobia) - F40.10  
2. Agoraphobia - F40.00  
3. Selective mutism - F94.0  
4. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) - F43.10

116,"Olaf Hendricks, a 51-year-old married businessman, presented to an outpatient psychiatrist with problems relating to periodically feeling helpless and lacking confidence. He reported that he usually feels fine except when he is confronted with his inability to travel by airplane. His only daughter had delivered a baby in the prior year, and although he desperately wanted to meet his first granddaughter, he felt unable to fly across the Atlantic Ocean to where his daughter lived.

The patient’s anxiety about flying had begun 3 years earlier when he was on an airplane that landed during an ice storm. He had last flown a year earlier but had cried during both takeoff and landing; he had then found himself unable to return from that trip by airplane and instead took a train from Rome to Amsterdam. He had gone with his wife to an airport one additional time, 1 year prior to the evaluation, to fly to his daughter’s wedding in the United States. Despite having drunk a significant amount of alcohol, Mr. Hendricks felt unable to board the airplane. After that failed effort, he tended to feel intense anxiety when he even considered the possibility of flying. Anxiety about business trips had led him to decline a promotion as well as an external job offer. Mr. Hendricks sees himself as a “family man” and feels terrible that he failed to attend his daughter’s wedding and has not yet been able to meet his granddaughter.

Aside from guilt and regret related to his inability to fly, Mr. Hendricks denied other symptoms of depression and anxiety. He had increased his alcohol consumption to three glasses of wine nightly in order to “unwind,” but denied any history of alcohol complications or withdrawal symptoms. He also denied a family history of psychiatric problems.

He denied experiencing anxiety in other situations, indicating that his colleagues saw him as a forceful and successful businessman who could “easily” deliver speeches in front of hundreds of people. When specifically asked, he reported that as a child, he had been “petrified” that he might get attacked by a wild animal. This fear had led him to refuse to go on family camping trips or even on long hikes in the country. As an adult, he said that he had no worries about being attacked by wild animals because he lived in a large city and took vacations by train to other large urban areas.","1. Specific phobia, situational (flying on airplanes)
2. Specific phobia, animals",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Evaluating symptoms and diagnoses**

I'm analyzing symptoms that started after a storm landing; it seems more like a phobia. Adjustment disorder is supposed to last less than 6 months after a stressful event, but these symptoms have lasted 3 years, so that's not appropriate. I’m considering PTSD, but there’s no re-experiencing. I could note specific phobia regarding flying and mild alcohol use disorder, but the drinking seems like increased consumption without the necessary withdrawal or complications. So, I can't diagnose alcohol use disorder.

**Listing possible diagnoses**

I need to come up with 5 diagnoses, even if some are less likely. I could consider things like Specific Phobia, animal type (in remission) or maybe Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder. The instructions say to provide the top 5 most likely DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses with ICD-10 codes. ""Specific Phobia, situational type"" seems like a primary candidate. I might also list ""Alcohol use disorder, mild,"" but I'm uncertain.

Additionally, I could note ""Other Specified Anxiety Disorder,"" even if it's less likely.

**Choosing differential diagnoses**

I shouldn’t fabricate diagnoses, but I can propose differential ones. The user requested the top 5 most likely diagnoses, which includes some rule-outs but must be plausible given the information. Some possibilities are Specific Phobia (situational type), Specific Phobia (animal type, in remission), and maybe mild Alcohol Use Disorder. Although including PTSD might not fit well since there are no symptoms. Another option could be Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder, but I'll stick to likely candidates. 

I could go with: 1) Specific phobia, situational type (flying), F40.248, and 2) Specific phobia, animal type (in full remission), F40.218, after confirming the correct codes.

**Verifying diagnosis codes**

I need to be precise with diagnosis codes, especially regarding phobias. I’m looking into the ICD-10 codes, specifically F40.2, which refers to ""Specific (isolated) phobias."" There are subcategories, such as F40.218 for Other Animal Type Phobia and F40.230 for Blood-Injection-Injury Type Phobia. But I want to ensure I get this right. It might be safer to use the general code F40.20 for ""Specific Phobia, unspecified,"" although F40.248 for fear of flying could also fit the user’s needs. Ultimately, I want to clarify the accurate codes requested.

**Clarifying phobia codes**

I need to ensure the F-codes I use are correct, especially for specific phobias. F40.20 is for Specific Phobia, unspecified, but there’s also F40.243, which is the code for fear of flying. I’m realizing the ICD-10 allows for these detailed codes, and it might be best to specify F40.243 if I want to be precise. However, using the broader F40.248 for situational phobias could also be a safe option.

Given the guidelines, I should stick with DSM-5-TR diagnoses. It's important to list the top 5 plausible diagnoses while ensuring they align with the corresponding ICD-10 F-codes.

**Determining diagnoses and codes**

I need to identify five psychiatric diagnoses, focusing on plausible ones based on the provided case. It’s crucial I don’t fabricate details; thus, I must rely only on information given. ""Specific phobia, situational type"" certainly fits, and ""Specific phobia, animal type (in full remission)"" might be relevant too. Other possibilities could include ""Alcohol use disorder, mild"" if criteria are partially met, but I’m unsure about that diagnosis now. The goal is to find what truly aligns with DSM-5-TR criteria while ensuring the inclusion of corresponding ICD-10 F-codes.

**Listing potential diagnoses**

I’m assessing the case to identify five likely diagnoses while being careful not to fabricate details. Given the alcohol consumption of three glasses, I might consider ""Alcohol use disorder, mild,"" though it's a little uncertain. I’ll likely include ""Specific phobia, situational type (fear of flying)"" as the primary diagnosis. For the secondary diagnoses, I could list ""Panic disorder,"" ""Agoraphobia,"" ""Posttraumatic stress disorder,"" and possibly ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder."" I'll make sure to match these with their appropriate ICD-10 F-codes.

**Determining psychiatric diagnoses**

I’m considering whether the individual has ""Situational type specific phobia"" related to flying and possibly ""Alcohol use disorder, mild,"" given his nightly drinking. We could include ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" for limited symptom panic attacks, but it's not a strong fit. For the top diagnoses, I might list: 1) Specific phobia (fear of flying) - F40.243; 2) Alcohol use disorder, mild - F10.10; 3) Specific phobia, animal type (in remission) - F40.218; 4) Posttraumatic stress disorder - F43.10; and 5) Adjustment disorder with anxiety - F43.22. I’ll need to confirm the appropriate codes and ensure they align with DSM-5-TR guidelines.

**Assessing alcohol use disorder**

I'm looking into the DSM-5-TR criteria for alcohol use disorder which includes several factors like drinking more than intended, unsuccessful attempts to cut down, and using alcohol in hazardous situations. While he drinks three glasses nightly, it may indicate tolerance, but since he didn't board the plane while intoxicated, it doesn't meet the physical hazard criteria. Given the complexity, I might consider listing ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" or ""Specific phobia, situational type"" and other possible diagnoses, but determining the most plausible is tricky. I need to ensure a structured list that aligns well with DSM criteria.

**Considering differential diagnoses**

I need to evaluate the diagnoses, starting with Specific Phobia (situational) as the primary option. For the differential list, I could consider Panic Disorder, Agoraphobia, Social Anxiety Disorder, PTSD, and Alcohol Use Disorder. However, Panic Disorder and Agoraphobia seem less likely based on the details provided. I think Alcohol Use Disorder is possible due to increased drinking, but maybe just mild. Specifically, I should finalize the list to include the most plausible conditions while ensuring they meet the criteria established in the DSM-5-TR.

**Validating diagnoses and coding**

I need to push through the details about the diagnoses based on the case. The onset of symptoms post-trauma suggests possible PTSD versus specific phobia, but the absence of hyperarousal points toward specific phobia instead. Given the user's drinking patterns, I should consider a differential list including specific phobia, PTSD, panic disorder, agoraphobia, and mild alcohol use disorder. 

I’ll ensure I have the right ICD-10 F-codes for each diagnosis before finalizing the list of top five potential diagnoses.

**Finalizing diagnostic list**

I’m considering whether to include childhood animal phobia as part of the diagnoses, since it suggests a predisposition but isn't current. It's tricky because the user asked for present diagnoses, not history. I'll stick with the following top five diagnoses and their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes:

1. Specific phobia, situational type (fear of flying) - F40.243  
2. Alcohol use disorder, mild - F10.10  
3. Panic disorder - F41.0  
4. Posttraumatic stress disorder - F43.10  
5. Agoraphobia - F40.00  

I’ll ensure these codes are accurate and finalize the list accordingly!

**Considering alcohol use and diagnoses**

I'm pondering whether to interpret the user’s increased alcohol consumption as a sign of hazardous use or an inability to cut down. However, just increased consumption alone doesn't seem to satisfy the criteria for Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). While I could consider ""Specific phobia, situational type (fear of flying)"" as the primary diagnosis, I’m thinking maybe I should include ""Alcohol use disorder, mild"" as well. Despite the uncertainty around the alcohol diagnosis, I’m leaning toward these final five:

1. Specific phobia, situational type (fear of flying) - F40.243  
2. Alcohol use disorder, mild - F10.10  
3. Panic disorder - F41.0  
4. Posttraumatic stress disorder - F43.10  
5. Agoraphobia - F40.00  

This lineup seems to reflect the case complexities while aligning with DSM-5-TR guidelines.

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

I'm considering that we might include ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" due to feelings of helplessness, or maybe ""Persistent depressive disorder"" related to guilt, but he's denied those feelings. Given the user’s request for diagnoses, I’ll prepare a straightforward list without any reasoning.

The primary diagnosis is ""Specific phobia, situational type (fear of flying)"" coded as F40.243. Then, for the four secondary diagnoses, I’ll list:

1. Specific phobia, situational type (fear of flying) - F40.243  
2. Alcohol use disorder, mild - F10.10  
3. Panic disorder - F41.0  
4. Posttraumatic stress disorder - F43.10  
5. Agoraphobia - F40.00

117,"Peggy Isaac was a 41-year-old administrative assistant who was referred for an outpatient evaluation by her primary care physician with a chief complaint of “I’m always on edge.” She lived alone and had never married or had children. She had never before seen a psychiatrist.

Ms. Isaac had lived with her longtime boyfriend until 8 months earlier, at which time he had abruptly ended the relationship to date a younger woman. Soon thereafter, Ms. Isaac began to agonize about routine tasks and the possibility of making mistakes at work. She felt uncharacteristically tense and fatigued. She had difficulty focusing. She also started to worry excessively about money and, to economize, she moved into a cheaper apartment in a less desirable neighborhood. She repeatedly sought reassurance from her office mates and her mother. No one seemed able to help, and she worried about being “too much of a burden.”

During the 3 months prior to the evaluation, Ms. Isaac began to avoid going out at night, fearing that something bad would happen and she would be unable to summon help. More recently, she avoided going out in the daytime as well. She also felt “exposed and vulnerable” walking to the grocery store three blocks away, so she avoided shopping. After describing that she had figured out how to get her food delivered, she added, “It’s ridiculous. I honestly feel something terrible is going to happen in one of the aisles and no one will help me, so I won’t even go in.” When in her apartment, she could often relax and enjoy a good book or movie.

Ms. Isaac said she had “always been a little nervous.” Through much of kindergarten, she had cried inconsolably when her mother tried to drop her off. She reported seeing a counselor at age 10, during her parents’ divorce, because “my mother thought I was too clingy.” She added that she had never liked being alone, having had boyfriends constantly (occasionally overlapping) since age 16. She explained, “I hated being single, and I was always pretty, so I was never single for very long.” Nevertheless, until the recent breakup, she said she had always thought of herself as “fine.” She had been successful at work, jogged daily, maintained a solid network of friends, and had “no real complaints.”

On initial interview, Ms. Isaac said she had been sad for a few weeks after her boyfriend left, but denied ever having felt worthless, guilty, hopeless, anhedonic, or suicidal. She said her weight was unchanged and her sleep was fine. The patient denied psychomotor changes. She did describe significant anxiety, with a Generalized Anxiety Disorder–7 score of 18, indicating severe anxiety.",Generalized anxiety disorder,dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Considering diagnoses for anxiety**

I think we shouldn't fabricate anything, but proposing agoraphobia might be valid, even with a duration of only three months, especially since the question asks for the top five most likely diagnoses. I can certainly include it based on the information we have. We might need a structured list of DSM-5-TR diagnoses. The complaint suggests anxiety and avoidance behaviors, which align with agoraphobia—especially since there’s no mention of panic attacks. So, it’s likely agoraphobia without panic disorder.

**Analyzing possible diagnoses**

I'm considering that her worries about routine tasks could stem from anxiety, and I wonder if the primary diagnosis should be agoraphobia. She’s started avoiding going out, which feels more impairing, but it’s only been three months. Initially, she showed generalized anxiety symptoms after a breakup—worries about tasks, mistakes, and money, pointing to GAD. Now, avoidance due to fear suggests agoraphobia. It could be GAD with comorbid agoraphobia, but she might not meet the six-month criterion. Perhaps we should consider both or even adult separation anxiety disorder triggered by her breakup.

**Determining potential diagnoses**

I’m noticing that she can relax at home, but separation anxiety usually involves reluctance to be away from a significant attachment figure. Since she’s alone and fears being outside home alone, that points more toward agoraphobia. I consider if dependent personality disorder might be relevant, but I need to focus on the top five diagnoses. I believe the possible diagnoses are GAD, agoraphobia, adjustment disorder with anxiety, separation anxiety disorder, and dependent personality disorder. Now, I have to weigh their strength and decide on the order, ensuring we have four secondary diagnoses to include with proper coding.

**Determining ICD-10 codes for diagnoses**

I’m laying out the ICD-10 F codes for possible diagnoses: Generalized anxiety disorder is F41.1, agoraphobia is F40.00, adjustment disorder with anxiety is F43.22, separation anxiety disorder is F93.0, and dependent personality disorder is F60.7. I’m also considering ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" at F41.8. I realize we have enough diagnoses, but including both agoraphobia and GAD would make two anxiety disorders. So, I think it’s best to finalize a list of the top five diagnoses with their respective codes, focusing on those most likely.

**Finalizing diagnosis list and codes**

I need to finalize the top five diagnoses along with their ICD-10 F codes. Generalized anxiety disorder is F41.1, and agoraphobia is F40.00. I’m considering dependent personality disorder as F60.7, separation anxiety disorder as F93.0, and possibly adjustment disorder with anxiety as F43.22. Alternatively, I could include ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" as F41.8. However, I want to ensure there’s no overlap, so I’ll go with these five as my final selection. I think the structure is clear and concise!

**Compiling final diagnoses list**

I need to finalize a list of the top five most likely diagnoses with their ICD-10 F codes. Based on the information, I’m confident that the primary diagnosis is Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1), closely followed by Agoraphobia (F40.00). Next, I'll list Separation Anxiety Disorder (F93.0) and Dependent Personality Disorder (F60.7), given the supporting evidence. The last diagnosis will be Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety (F43.22). This should comprehensively cover the relevant conditions in this case!

**Finalizing the diagnoses list**

I need to finalize the top five most likely diagnoses, each with their respective ICD-10 F codes. Here’s my proposed list: 

1. Generalized Anxiety Disorder - F41.1  
2. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder - F41.8  
3. Separation Anxiety Disorder - F93.0  
4. Other Specified Personality Disorder - F60.89  
5. Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety - F43.22

118,"A psychiatric transplant liaison service was called to evaluate Robert Jennings, a 50-year-old married white man, for a liver transplant in the context of an alcohol use disorder, advanced cirrhosis, and no other prior psychiatric history. Several weeks earlier, he had been hospitalized with acute alcohol-associated hepatitis and diagnosed with end-stage liver disease. Prednisolone 40 mg/day was prescribed for treatment of the hepatitis. Prior to that hospitalization, he had been unaware that his alcohol consumption was seriously damaging his health and was shocked to learn that he would eventually require a liver transplant. Upon discharge, he began an addiction treatment program that was mandatory for him to be listed for possible transplantation.

Outpatient psychiatric consultation was requested by the transplant team after the patient’s family expressed concern that he had recently become increasingly irritable and anxious and seemed to be having difficulty coping with the requirements for transplantation. Mr. Jennings’s primary care physician had recently prescribed alprazolam 0.5 mg as needed for his anxiety. This was initially helpful, but after several days his family noticed he seemed more irritable, lethargic, and forgetful.

When interviewed, the patient said that he had been tired for months prior to the diagnosis and that the fatigue had hampered his ability to work (his job required making deliveries for a shipping firm). Although the diagnosis had been a shock, he said he had left the hospital feeling “great, better than I’d felt in years.” For about a week after discharge, he described having enhanced energy and a sense of well-being, but he then began to feel anxious and restless. He slept poorly, unable to concentrate, and worried constantly about his health, finances, and family. He became less engaged with his family and stopped watching movies, normally his favorite pastime.

He denied having nightmares, flashbacks, avoidant behaviors, or racing thoughts. He also denied low mood, tearfulness, appetite changes, anhedonia, helplessness, hopelessness, or suicidality. He reported that he had started drinking daily 10 years earlier, stating that he enjoyed the taste of beer and liked socializing with friends after work. He developed tolerance to alcohol, needing to consume six to eight drinks per night to achieve the same effect. He described some withdrawal symptoms in the morning but did not drink during work hours; he underwent random testing due to his job as a truck driver. He did miss some family activities, preferring to drink, and this had been a source of marital conflict. He admitted feeling guilty about his alcohol use and its impact on him and his family. He denied using any alcohol since his hospitalization. He admitted to anger over having to undergo addiction counseling and had argued with the transplant team about this requirement. He denied having been an anxious person and considered himself able to handle most of life’s challenges without being overwhelmed. His family confirmed his description of himself and viewed his recent behavior as uncharacteristic.

On mental status examination, Mr. Jennings was a thin, jaundiced, tired-appearing man. His gait was normal, but he was fidgety while seated. He maintained eye contact and responded appropriately, although he repeatedly made comments like, “Something isn’t right” and “It’s not all in my head.” His affect was anxious and irritable, and his speech was terse. He appeared distracted but denied confusion and disorientation. He had no delusions or hallucinations. His thoughts were logical and coherent, without disorganization, and there was no latency to his responses. He scored 26 out of 30 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, missing points for recall and serial 7s. He scored in the normal range for Trail Making Test A and B but asked to have the instructions repeated for Trails B.","1. Alcohol use disorder, moderate, in early remission

I need to think this through carefully: the rubrics indicate I should focus on clinical reasoning, but the final output must just be a list. My task is to select the top five DSM diagnoses with their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes, steering clear of non-psychiatric conditions that don’t have F-codes. 

In the vignette, there's a 50-year-old man with alcohol use disorder and advanced cirrhosis, who was previously unaware of the damaging effects of alcohol. He’s now dealing with anxiety and irritability while preparing for a liver transplant.

**Analyzing symptoms and history**

The family noted that the man’s irritability, lethargy, and forgetfulness increased after several days. During the interview, he described feeling tired for months before his diagnosis. After leaving the hospital, he initially felt great and had more energy, but soon after, anxiety and restlessness set in. He began having trouble sleeping and concentrating, while also worrying about various issues. Interestingly, he stopped watching movies, which he used to love, hinting at possible subtle anhedonia despite denying low mood or other symptoms. His alcohol history shows a pattern of increasing tolerance over the years.

**Assessing withdrawal symptoms and behavior**

The man experiences withdrawal symptoms in the morning but refrains from drinking during work due to random testing requirements for his truck driver job. He missed family activities because he preferred drinking, leading to marital conflict and guilt. Although he denies alcohol use since hospitalization, he expressed anger at the requirement for addiction counseling. His family confirms that his recent behavior is uncharacteristic. During the mental status exam, he appeared thin, jaundiced, and tired, displaying anxious and irritable affect while showing concentration difficulties and worry about his situation.

**Evaluating potential diagnoses**

The man's anxiety onset likely followed a major stressor—his diagnosis and transplant evaluation—and could be influenced by steroids. After discharge, he experienced a week of improved energy, which might be due to relief or steroid-related hypomania, but it’s definitely not mania. He shows mild cognitive difficulties possibly related to hepatic encephalopathy or anxiety. My top five differential diagnoses should focus on Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Substance-Induced Anxiety Disorder. The primary diagnosis could be ""Alcohol Use Disorder, moderate,"" as this impacts his transplant evaluation significantly, but I should also consider his current psychiatric symptoms.

**Identifying potential mood disorders**

The vignette indicates family concerns about irritability and anxiety after stressors like the diagnosis and transplant evaluation. This could be a steroid-induced mood disorder, hepatic encephalopathy, or possibly an adjustment disorder. Given his symptoms, we should consider factors like substance use and coping mechanisms. His week of feeling great could suggest steroid-induced euphoria, but he later exhibited anxiety, restlessness, and cognitive difficulties. My top five diagnoses could be Alcohol Use Disorder, Substance-Induced Anxiety Disorder, Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety, Sedative Intoxication Effect, and Mild Neurocognitive Disorder due to liver disease. I must prioritize based on likelihood.

**Determining anxiety disorder diagnosis**

I'm considering a primary diagnosis of Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder, especially since onset aligns with steroid treatment. In DSM-5, there are specific codes for such disorders, but I'm grappling with their accuracy. F10.180 fits alcohol-induced anxiety disorder, but I'm unsure about medication-induced codes; F06.4 seems to refer to anxiety due to another medical condition. Given the nuances, it might be safer to diagnose Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety and potentially ""Other Specified Bipolar and Related Disorder."" I aim for a definitive diagnosis while ensuring accurate coding for the best clarity.

**Identifying diagnoses for anxiety**

I'm thinking through the primary diagnosis, possibly Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder, given the steroid treatment. However, I also need to consider other options like ""Other Specified Anxiety Disorder"" but I have to stick to the formal codes. I'll choose the top five psychiatric diagnoses and their ICD-10 codes. 

The likely diagnoses include Alcohol Use Disorder (F10.20), Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety (F43.22), and possibly Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder (maybe F06.4). I'm also considering Mild Neurocognitive Disorder (F06.7) and maybe Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1), even if it's less likely.

**Evaluating cognitive and anxiety diagnoses**

I'm considering mild cognitive impairment, likely related to the liver disease, indicated by a MoCA score of 26. For anxiety diagnosis, options include ""Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition"" (F06.4) due to the end-stage liver disease and steroid use. I might also look at ""Unspecified Anxiety Disorder"" (F41.9). Lethargy from alprazolam might suggest ""Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Intoxication,"" yet he hasn't shown classic intoxication symptoms. 

Additionally, I need to compile five relevant diagnoses, potentially including Alcohol Use Disorder, Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety, and Mild Neurocognitive Disorder due to known conditions.

**Assessing mental status and diagnoses**

I'm observing the mental status: he seems fidgety, anxious, irritable, and his speech is terse. I’m considering cognitive changes due to hepatic encephalopathy or benzodiazepine sedation, but it’s unclear if he meets criteria for a mild neurocognitive disorder. He shows forgetfulness and irritability, leading me to think about various diagnoses, including Alcohol Use Disorder and Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety. 

I need to provide a structured list of top diagnoses: possibly unspecified anxiety disorders or substance-induced conditions, along with relevant symptoms. I’m weighing all options carefully to ensure accuracy.

**Evaluating psychiatric diagnoses**

I’m tasked with identifying principal and secondary diagnoses for a case involving alcohol use disorder, advanced cirrhosis, and no prior psychiatric history. The main diagnosis is likely Alcohol Use Disorder, moderate. For the secondary diagnoses, I’m considering options for current anxiety symptoms, possible medication-induced mood/anxiety issues, a neurocognitive disorder, and possibly sedation. 

I’m weighing various diagnoses like Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety, Unspecified Anxiety Disorder, and considering the implications of corticosteroids on mood. I need a structured list of the top five plausible diagnoses, emphasizing evidence and clinical relevance while avoiding redundancy.

**Identifying psychiatric diagnoses**

I need to outline the diagnoses for a case involving alcohol use disorder and anxiety amid advanced cirrhosis. My primary diagnosis is Alcohol Use Disorder, moderate. For secondary diagnoses, I'm considering Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety and Anxiety Disorder due to another medical condition, possibly linked to steroids or hepatic effects. 

I’m also weighing Mild Neurocognitive Disorder and Sedative Intoxication due to alprazolam. Although some diagnoses might overlap, I’m trying to ensure I meet the requirement of five distinct diagnoses for this structured list.

**Deciding psychiatric diagnoses**

I’m working on labeling a diagnosis for substance or medication-induced anxiety, potentially linked to corticosteroids. The code F06.4 could work, but it might be best to categorize it under ""Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition."" It gets tricky because I want to ensure the labels match the ICD codes appropriately.

After considering various factors, I think it makes sense to go with:

1. Alcohol use disorder, moderate - F10.20.
2. Adjustment disorder with anxiety - F43.22.
3. Other specified anxiety disorder - F41.8.
4. Mild neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition - F06.7.
5. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication - F13.129.

**Determining anxiety disorders**

I'm deciding on the best classifications for anxiety disorders in this context. It seems ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" could apply here, particularly for generalized anxiety not lasting 6 months. However, adjustment disorder might already cover that, so I’ll list both.

For a diagnosis related to corticosteroids, F06.4 seems fitting. Although there are complexities in matching DSM-5 labels to ICD-10 codes, I should ensure consistency. Then I’ll verify each code before finalizing the top five diagnoses. They are likely:

1. Alcohol use disorder, moderate - F10.20
2. Adjustment disorder with anxiety - F43.22
3. Other specified anxiety disorder - F41.8
4. Mild neurocognitive disorder - F06.7
5. Sedative intoxication - F13.129

**Finalizing diagnoses**

I’m considering the best diagnoses and codes for the user’s case. We should probably skip benzodiazepine intoxication and instead consider ""Unspecified neurocognitive disorder"" or ""Unspecified anxiety disorder."" To make a top five list, I might choose ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" (F41.8) or ""Mild neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.7).

Also, ""Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder"" could be coded as F06.4 or F19.180. I want to focus on straightforward codes that best reflect the situation, so the potential list could look like:

1. Alcohol use disorder (F10.20)
2. Adjustment disorder with anxiety (F43.22)
3. Mild neurocognitive disorder (F06.7)
4. Anxiety disorder due to known physiological condition (F06.4)
5. Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions (F54)

**Choosing diagnoses thoughtfully**

I’m considering the best diagnoses for the situation. ""F54"" could reflect psychological factors, but it might not fit perfectly. I might want to include ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" to capture anxiety symptoms—though there’s an identifiable stressor. His lack of depressed mood and decreased interest makes ""Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood"" (F43.23) tricky. 

Perhaps ""Adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance"" (F43.25) could be valid instead. Since there's a week of heightened energy, we might consider ""Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar and Related Disorder,"" but that needs careful attention to coding. I really want to ensure accuracy here!

To finalize, I could go with these possible diagnoses:
1. Alcohol use disorder, moderate - F10.20
2. Adjustment disorder with anxiety - F43.22
3. Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition - F06.4
4. Mild neurocognitive disorder - F06.7
5. Unspecified anxiety disorder - F41.9 or a more specific code for sedation. I’ll settle on what accurately represents the case.

**Confirming coding patterns**

I'm trying to confirm some coding patterns for cannabis intoxication. I think ""Cannabis intoxication, uncomplicated"" is F12.129, but I get a bit confused with the codes, as F12.929 comes to mind. Let's check typical categories for accuracy, especially for alcohol and other substances. 

I realize it's best to keep it simple, avoiding complex substance intoxications. Instead, I might just stick to the well-known psychiatric codes like F10.20 for alcohol use disorder, F43.22 for adjustment disorder with anxiety, and F41.9 for unspecified anxiety. This way, I can keep the diagnosis straightforward.

**Reviewing potential diagnoses**

The patient showed improved mood after discharge but then developed anxiety, which isn’t typical for hepatic encephalopathy. Mild neurocognitive disorder (NCD) seems plausible. There’s a question of whether it could be an alcohol-induced anxiety disorder (F10.180), which might be due to withdrawal symptoms after he stopped drinking. However, his anxiety started after discharge, raising questions about its persistence and classification. 

Considering steroid effects, perhaps we should include ""Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder"" with code F06.4. We may also need to note potential alcohol use disorder, keeping the diagnosis straightforward.

**Finalizing potential diagnoses**

Considering the patient's symptoms, I'll determine the top five likely diagnoses with corresponding ICD-10 codes. 

1. Alcohol use disorder, moderate - F10.20.
2. Adjustment disorder with anxiety - F43.22.
3. Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder (likely corticosteroid-induced) - F06.4.
4. Mild neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition (hepatic encephalopathy) - F06.7.
5. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication - possibly F13.920 or F13.929.

These selections best reflect the symptoms and potential underlying conditions observed.

**Examining anxiety diagnosis codes**

I'm considering how ""Mild neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition"" might fit, though it has its uncertainties. While medication-induced anxiety is a possibility, I need to nail down specific codes. I'm leaning towards using F06.4 for anxiety due to a medical condition, but there might be a case for F19.180 as well, especially if I consider medication as an ""other substance.""

I'm still not fully decided on the best approach for coding and may even need to include ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" if uncertain about medication relevance. However, it's crucial to establish the top five most likely diagnoses accurately based on the patient's conditions.

**Analyzing anxiety and medication-induced disorders**

I think medication-induced anxiety or mood disorder could definitely be among the possible diagnoses, so I want to make sure to include it. I'm verifying that the ICD-10 code for ""substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder"" is F19.180. It seems plausible, but I want to ensure we accurately label and code everything.

I’m considering the top five diagnoses while trying to decide the most appropriate codes, especially for ""Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication"" given the patient's recent medication use. It’s crucial to get these details right!

**Verifying ICD-10 F-codes**

The user is asking for ICD-10 F-codes, and it's important to be as accurate as possible, even if they don't need extra digits. For substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder, I think the code F19.180 is correct. In ICD-10, F19 indicates mental disorders due to multiple drug use. For alcohol-induced anxiety disorder, the code F10.180 could fit, meaning an ""Alcohol-induced anxiety disorder."" I feel uncertain about F19.180, though, since it refers to other substances too, so clarity is key.

**Exploring medication-induced disorders**

I’m recalling the DSM codes for medication-induced anxiety and depressive disorders. For anxiety, I think it’s F06.4, and for depression, maybe F06.31? I want to verify this reasoning: F06.4 indicates anxiety due to a physiological condition, which makes sense since medication effects can be physiological. It seems plausible that the DSM uses these F06.* codes for medication-induced disorders because of this connection. I also wonder about the reasons behind keeping ""substance/medication-induced"" and how it's clinically conceptualized.

**Clarifying psychosis coding**

I’m considering how steroid-induced psychosis is typically coded. In practice, it seems like it's often coded as F23, which refers to brief psychotic disorder, or possibly F06.2. I’m just double-checking these details to make sure I’m getting it right. Each code is linked to specific diagnostic criteria, and I want to ensure I understand why these particular codes are used in these cases. I'll keep this in mind!

**Evaluating medication-related coding**

I'm considering that medication-induced anxiety disorder could be coded as F06.4, since it's linked to a physiological condition caused by medication. The DSM likely instructs using F06.4 for medication-related issues, which seems plausible. For instance, with ""Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder,"" when this arises from medication, the code is F06.31. There seems to be a pattern for these conditions' coding in the DSM, which I find interesting!

**Evaluating anxiety disorders**

If I choose F06.4, I’m considering calling it ""Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition,"" but the vignette suggests steroid-induced. I'm a bit unsure if that fits ""another medical condition"" or counts as ""substance/medication induced."" I think I could state ""Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder (prednisolone),"" yet can’t include the specifier. F06.4 seems plausible for medication-induced conditions, but to align with what the user asked, I need to lean on DSM diagnoses. In that case, ""Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder"" feels appropriate. The code could still be F06.4.

**Labeling disorders**

I'm thinking of labeling it as ""Mild neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition."" That seems appropriate. Then there's F13.920, which refers to ""Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication, uncomplicated."" So, I can go ahead and describe it as ""Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication"" with the code F13.920. That feels like a solid choice! Overall, I’m focused on making sure the labels are accurate and match the intended conditions well.

**Finalizing diagnosis codes**

I need to focus on providing the top five diagnoses along with their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes without any personal information. The user asked clearly for the primary diagnosis and four secondary diagnoses, and I can include ""moderate"" where appropriate. For instance, ""Alcohol use disorder, moderate"" should match the code F10.20. I should opt for F06.4 for ""Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder"" and F13.920 for ""Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication."" I'll make sure to present this in a clear list format.","1. Alcohol use disorder, moderate - F10.20  
2. Adjustment disorder with anxiety - F43.22  
3. Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder - F06.4

119,"Samuel King, a 52-year-old never-married janitor, presented for treatment of depression. He had been struggling with depressive symptoms for years and had tried fluoxetine, citalopram, and supportive psychotherapy, with minor improvement. He worked full-time but engaged in very few activities outside of work.

When asked how he felt, Mr. King said that his mood was low, he was unable to enjoy things, and he had insomnia, feelings of hopelessness, low energy, and difficulty concentrating and making decisions. He denied current suicidality but added that a few years earlier, he had taken a full bottle of medication with the intent to kill himself. He reported that he had done this during a time that he was abusing alcohol. He denied current alcohol or illicit substance use.

When asked about anxiety, Mr. King said he was worried about contracting diseases such as HIV. Aware of an unusually strong disinfectant smell, the interviewer asked the patient if he had any particular cleaning behaviors related to the HIV concerns. Mr. King paused and clarified that he avoided touching practically anything outside of his home. When further encouraged, Mr. King said that if he even came close to things that he considered potentially contaminated, he had to wash his hands incessantly with household bleach. He described that he felt like “something was still there” in his hands and he had to wash his hands until it felt that he had finally done it “right.”

On average, Mr. King washed his hands up to 30 times a day, spending hours on this routine. Physical contact was particularly difficult. Shopping for groceries and taking public transportation were a big problem, and he had almost given up trying to socialize or engage in romantic relationships. These behaviors had only intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic, though a co-worker liked to joke that Mr. King had been cleaning and social distancing for years before it became fashionable.

When asked if he had other worries, Mr. King replied that he had intrusive images of hitting someone, fears that he would say things that might be offensive or inaccurate, and concerns about disturbing his neighbors. To counteract the anxiety produced by these images and thoughts, he constantly replayed prior conversations in his mind, kept diaries to record what he said, and often apologized for fear he might have sounded offensive. When he showered, he made sure that the water in the tub only reached a certain level for fear that if he were not attentive, he would flood his neighbors.

Mr. King used gloves at work and performed well. He had no medical problems. He spent most of his free time at home. Although he enjoyed the company of others, the fear of having to touch something if he was invited to a meal or to another person’s home was too much for him to handle.

The examination revealed a casually dressed man who smelled strongly of bleach. He was worried and constricted but cooperative, coherent, and goal directed. He denied hallucinations and other strongly held ideas. He denied a current intention to hurt himself or others. He was cognitively intact. He recognized that his fears and urges were “kinda crazy,” but he felt they were out of his control.","1. Obsessive-compulsive disorder, with good or fair insight
2. Major depressive disorder",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Considering diagnoses and comorbidities**

I’m looking into possible diagnoses, ensuring they’re plausible for the case. I want to avoid adding anything improbable. There are potential comorbidities with OCD that include major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders, among others. The individual shows significant avoidance in relationships, likely due to contamination fears tied to OCD, not because of feelings of inadequacy. So, avoidant personality disorder doesn't seem to apply here. I'm still considering other possibilities. What could be next?

**Assessing potential disorders**

I’m considering the intrusive violent images and fears of saying offensive things, which might suggest conditions like Generalized Anxiety Disorder or Social Anxiety Disorder, or maybe OCD. The obsessions involve harm and moral scrupulosity. I wonder if Somatic Symptom Disorder could be relevant, but it doesn’t seem to fit. As for Delusional Disorder or Psychosis, he shows insight and denies strong beliefs. There’s also insomnia related to depression and anxiety, but it doesn't meet criteria for a separate diagnosis. I’m stuck on how to proceed with these complex possibilities.

**Evaluating depressive and anxiety disorders**

I'm considering possible diagnoses, including ""Depressive Disorder, Unspecified."" I thought about ""Alcohol-Induced Depressive Disorder,"" but that doesn't fit. For anxiety, I’m contemplating ""Other Specified Anxiety Disorder"" or “Unspecified Anxiety Disorder” to reflect his worries. He does have anxiety, but it's more tied to OCD. His worries—like contamination and harm—seem more obsessional than typical worries from GAD. However, since he mentioned being worried about HIV, I could justify including ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder"" as a secondary diagnosis, but that feels lower probability. It's all about sticking to the facts provided!

**Analyzing GAD and anxiety disorders**

To meet criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder, there needs to be excessive worry for at least six months along with three symptoms like sleep disturbance or trouble concentrating. He does show some of these signs, but they might just point to depression. I’m thinking about ""Unspecified Anxiety Disorder"" since it requires prominent anxiety but not full criteria for specific disorders. However, since his anxiety seems connected to OCD, it may not fit here either. I also considered ""Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder,"" but he recognizes his issues as out of his control, so that doesn't align either.

**Evaluating possible disorders**

The client keeps diaries and replays conversations, likely due to anxiety and intrusive thoughts connected to OCD. Without additional personality traits, I can't conclude much. I'm considering ""Depressive Disorder,"" but that doesn’t fit well. Various anxiety disorders come to mind, yet none seem quite right. 

He shows classic OCD traits with fears about contamination and washing hands excessively, pointing towards OCD as a primary diagnosis. While social anxiety elements exist, it doesn't fit entirely. I'll consider structuring the diagnosis list, likely prioritizing OCD and persistent depressive disorder. But it's tricky!

**Determining potential diagnoses**

The user's situation seems complex, with behaviors like diary keeping and replaying conversations stemming from OCD and anxiety issues, especially during COVID. His intrusive worries—about contamination, harming others, and offending people—lead me to consider ""Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder"" as the primary diagnosis. His depressive symptoms are significant, possibly indicating ""Major Depressive Disorder"" or ""Persistent Depressive Disorder."" Given his history of alcohol use, ""Alcohol Use Disorder"" could also be applicable, though the details about remission are vague. For the fourth and fifth diagnoses, I could suggest ""Unspecified Anxiety Disorder"" and ""Unspecified Personality Disorder,"" but I must ensure these are plausible given the information provided.

**Clarifying possible diagnoses**

I’m considering the user's situation with possible diagnoses. The primary diagnosis could be ""Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder,"" and for the secondary diagnoses, I might suggest ""Major Depressive Disorder"" and ""Alcohol Use Disorder in sustained remission."" I’m also weighing the options for other possible alternatives, like ""Illness Anxiety Disorder,"" but it seems less fitting given the compulsive behaviors. Overall, I want to stick to the information given, clearly noting each diagnosis along with their appropriate codes, keeping it structured while ensuring plausible options are listed without fabricating anything.

**Determining diagnostic options**

I'm looking at the user's situation and the criteria for Persistent Depressive Disorder, which requires a depressed mood more days than not for at least two years, along with additional symptoms like insomnia and low energy. He appears to meet several criteria, so this diagnosis seems strongly supported. Primary will likely be Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, with Persistent Depressive Disorder and Alcohol Use Disorder in remission as secondary. I’ll make sure to assign the appropriate ICD-10 codes for each diagnosis.

**Evaluating alcohol use and diagnoses**

The user mentioned ""abusing alcohol,"" which raises questions about severity. Given the suicide attempt, I might lean toward moderate/severe Alcohol Use Disorder, coding as F10.21 for ""in remission."" However, I must confirm the specifics. For other potential diagnoses, I’m weighing options like ""Illness Anxiety Disorder,"" but his compulsive behaviors lean more toward OCD. I’m considering the list of top diagnoses and will include OCD as primary, persistent depressive disorder, and potentially major depressive disorder as alternatives. It’s challenging to ensure clarity and adherence to the DSM-5-TR guidelines!

**Determining potential diagnoses**

I’m considering various potential diagnoses for the user. Starting with anxiety disorders, I wonder if ""Anxiety disorder, unspecified"" (F41.9) is applicable, or perhaps ""Agoraphobia"" (F40.00) due to avoidance of public places. However, contamination fears lean more toward OCD. I’m navigating through options such as ""Major Depressive Disorder"" versus ""Persistent Depressive Disorder,"" wanting to ensure I list coherent diagnoses without contradictions. Ultimately, I aim for a clear representation of the top five psychiatric diagnoses in line with the guidelines. It’s quite tricky to ensure accuracy!

**Clarifying diagnosis options**

I’m exploring various potential psychiatric diagnoses based on the user’s symptoms. For sleep disruptions, I can consider ""Primary insomnia"" (F51.01) but need to be cautious with that coding. I’m looking into severe anxiety conditions, particularly OCD and its compulsive behaviors. Subsequently, I try to balance out the primary diagnosis with secondary options like ""Major Depressive Disorder"" and ""Persistent Depressive Disorder."" I aim to generate a structured list of the top five most likely diagnoses while ensuring consistency with DSM guidelines. It’s a complex journey, but I want the final list to be accurate!

**Identifying possible diagnoses**

I’m analyzing potential psychiatric diagnoses considering symptoms like obsessive-compulsive behaviors and depressive disorders. It seems ""Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder"" (F42.2) is the primary candidate, possibly combined with ""Persistent Depressive Disorder"" (F34.1) or ""Major Depressive Disorder"" (F33.1). I also contemplate including options like ""Alcohol Use Disorder in Remission"" and various anxiety disorders. It’s essential to arrange a structured list of five likely diagnoses based on the user’s symptoms, ensuring I don’t overcrowd with redundancy. I have to be precise while avoiding conflicting details.

**Evaluating potential diagnoses**

I’m looking at various diagnoses related to the user's symptoms, including ""Alcohol Use Disorder in Sustained Remission"" and ""Illness Anxiety Disorder."" After examining their behaviors and concerns, it seems ""Illness Anxiety Disorder"" is less likely as the fears are better explained by OCD. ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder"" is another consideration, but it seems to overlap with the obsessive nature of the user's thoughts. 

As I sort through options, I’m leaning towards including ""Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder,"" ""Major Depressive Disorder,"" and ""Social Anxiety Disorder"" in the structured list of possible conditions. I'll also consider ""Persistent Depressive Disorder,"" depending on their history.

**Determining diagnostic possibilities**

I’m exploring possible diagnoses for the user’s symptoms. ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder"" (GAD) doesn’t seem to fit well since the worries are more intrusive and bizarre. ""Illness Anxiety Disorder"" and ""Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder"" could be alternatives, but maybe not the strongest fits. 

For my top five diagnoses, I’m considering:

1. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (F42.2)
2. Persistent Depressive Disorder (F34.1)
3. Alcohol Use Disorder (F10.21)
4. Illness Anxiety Disorder (F45.21)
5. Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (F60.5)

I’ll ensure I only include the most plausible diagnoses based on symptoms.

**Analyzing potential diagnoses**

In reviewing Mr. King's situation, he describes intrusive worries, which could indicate conditions like OCD or GAD. However, to diagnose GAD, there has to be excessive worry more days than not for at least six months. He shows signs that could fit GAD, but there’s also illness anxiety to consider. 

For my top five diagnoses, I’m contemplating:

1. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (F42.2)
2. Major Depressive Disorder (F32.1)
3. Alcohol Use Disorder in Remission (F10.21)
4. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1)
5. Illness Anxiety Disorder (F45.21)

This list reflects the most plausible considerations based on the information provided.

**Choosing final diagnoses**

I’m focusing on selecting the correct five diagnoses with their respective ICD-10 codes. Here’s what I’m considering:

1. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (mixed obsessional thoughts and acts) - F42.2
2. Persistent Depressive Disorder (dysthymia) - F34.1
3. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, moderate - F33.1 (or I might use F32.1 for a single episode, but I lean toward recurrent due to past suicide attempts).
4. Alcohol Use Disorder (in remission) - F10.21
5. Illness Anxiety Disorder - F45.21

Or potentially Generalized Anxiety Disorder - F41.1, depending on the evidence. So, I finalize with these considerations!

**Finalizing comorbidity list**

I’m exploring the final five diagnoses to include in my response. Here’s the current structure I’m considering:

1. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (mixed obsessional thoughts and acts) - F42.2
2. Persistent Depressive Disorder (dysthymia) - F34.1
3. Major Depressive Disorder, single episode moderate - F32.1
4. Alcohol Use Disorder (in remission) - F10.21
5. Illness Anxiety Disorder - F45.21

I’m deliberating whether to include Generalized Anxiety Disorder as an alternative fifth option. However, I believe sticking to relevant disorders is best while avoiding redundancy between MDD and PDD. Let’s proceed with this structured approach!

**Choosing top diagnoses**

I'm weighing the top five DSM-5-TR diagnoses. Right now, I’m considering:

1. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (mixed obsessional thoughts and acts) - F42.2
2. Persistent Depressive Disorder (dysthymia) - F34.1 
3. Alcohol Use Disorder (in remission) - F10.21 
4. Illness Anxiety Disorder - F45.21 
5. Generalized Anxiety Disorder - F41.1 

However, I’m also debating whether to use ""Unspecified Anxiety Disorder"" instead of GAD, as it might suit the limited information better. This is tricky, but I want to ensure the final list is accurate and aligns with the case details.

**Finalizing DSM-5-TR diagnoses**

I'm narrowing down the top five psychiatric diagnoses based on the user’s instructions, ensuring to include the proper names and codes. My finalized list is:

1. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (mixed obsessional thoughts and acts), with good or fair insight - F42.2  
2. Persistent Depressive Disorder (dysthymia) - F34.1  
3. Alcohol Use Disorder, in remission - F10.21  
4. Illness Anxiety Disorder - F45.21  
5. Generalized Anxiety Disorder - F41.1  

I’ll keep these organized and clear, aligning with the necessary DSM-5-TR format.","1. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (mixed obsessional thoughts and acts), with good or fair insight - **F42.2**  
2. Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) - **F34.1**

120,"Trevor Lewis, a 32-year-old single man living with his parents, was brought to his psychiatric consultation by his mother. She noted that since adolescence, her son had been concerned with germs, which led to long-standing hand-washing and showering rituals. During the prior 6 months, his symptoms had markedly worsened. He had become preoccupied with being infected by COVID-19 and spent the day cleaning not only his body but all of his clothing and linen. He had begun to insist that the family also wash their clothing and linen regularly, and that they keep the windows shut all the time. He allowed no visitors to their home. When the parents were occasionally exposed to other people by going outside, he insisted that they wear their masks in his presence for the ensuing 48 hours. The resulting conflicts had led to the current consultation.

Mr. Lewis had in the past received a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and cognitive-behavioral therapy for his symptoms. These had had some positive effects, and he had been able to complete high school successfully. Nevertheless, his symptoms had prevented him from completing college or working outside the home; he had long felt that his home was relatively germ-free in comparison to the outside world. However, over the past 6 months, he had increasingly indicated that home, too, was contaminated, including with COVID-19.

At the time of presentation, Mr. Lewis had no other obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms such as sexual, religious, or other obsessions; appearance or acquisition preoccupations; or body-focused repetitive behaviors. However, in the past he had also experienced obsessions relating to fears of harming himself or others, together with associated checking compulsions (e.g., checking that the stove was switched off). He had a childhood history of motor tics. During high school, he found that marijuana reduced his anxiety. He denied having had access to marijuana and other psychoactive substances since leaving school.

Mr. Lewis was interviewed over video using a telehealth system. He appeared disheveled and unkempt. He was completely convinced that COVID-19 had contaminated his home and that his washing and cleaning were necessary to stay uninfected. When challenged with information about COVID-19’s mode of spread, he answered that COVID-19 might come into the home through an open window or the sweat of visitors, and his masked parents could certainly get infected by going to the grocery store. He added that his parents had tried to convince him that he was excessively worried, but he did not believe them. In fact, his worries kept returning even when he tried to think of something else.

There was no evidence of hallucinations or of a formal thought disorder. He denied an intention to harm or kill himself or others. He was cognitively intact.","Obsessive-compulsive disorder, tic related, with absent insight/delusional beliefs",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Clarifying ICD-10 Codes**

I need to figure out whether F22 includes decimals. It seems that in the ICD-10-CM, F22 is described as ""Delusional disorders"" but could be too broad. Using F22.0 seems safer since it specifically refers to ""Delusional disorder."" However, I've found that in ICD-10-CM, F22 is actually billable without decimals. It's crucial to verify which version to use and ensure the codes are accurate, particularly for OCD and specific phobia, where decimals do apply.

**Understanding ICD-10 and DSM-5 Codes**

For persistent motor tics, I’m looking at F95.1 with decimals. For delusional disorder, I could use F22, though some might argue for F22.0 for consistency. However, in ICD-10-CM, F22.0 isn't commonly used. Since the user hasn't specified which version, I could lean towards F22. For OCD, while DSM-5 suggests using F42, F42.2 is billable and captures both obsessions and compulsions, making it a good choice. I need to ensure nothing extraneous is included that’s not part of the code.

**Assessing Anxiety Disorders**

For Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), it doesn't seem to fit perfectly since the worry is very specific, focused on germs. This makes IAD, or Illness Anxiety Disorder, a more plausible diagnosis, as it involves a preoccupation with having a serious illness. However, the cleaning rituals indicate a more obsessive-compulsive nature. Somatic Symptom Disorder requires physical symptoms, which aren’t present here. Maybe “Other Specified Anxiety Disorder” is worth considering, but I think OCD aligns better given the specific rituals.

**Evaluating Potential Diagnoses**

I’m considering various diagnoses, starting with schizophrenia, which seems less likely since there are no other psychotic symptoms present. OCD could be a factor, but probably not due to a medical condition. There's also the option of an adjustment disorder related to anxiety, possibly worsened by the pandemic, but it feels more like a long-standing issue. The user is looking for the top five diagnoses, likely expecting OCD as primary and possibly including Delusional Disorder, Illness Anxiety Disorder, Specific Phobia, and Tic Disorder. I need to evaluate these options carefully using the DSM-5-TR criteria.

**Diagnosing OCD and Differentials**

The primary diagnosis is OCD, characterized by obsessions about contamination and compulsive cleaning rituals. His insight is absent, as he is convinced the contamination is real. There are also previous tic disorders which qualify him further. Considering secondary diagnoses, I’m evaluating several differentials, including Delusional Disorder, Illness Anxiety Disorder, and Specific Phobia. Each has its nuances regarding features like compulsive behavior or preoccupation with health. While OCD fits best, I’m organizing the top five diagnoses efficiently, ensuring to list relevant coded conditions for clarity.

**Finalizing Diagnoses**

The individual presents with disheveled appearance, which raises questions about possible Major Depressive Disorder, but lacks other symptoms. Due to OCD, diagnoses like Social Anxiety or Avoidant Personality aren’t applicable. I'll confirm ICD-10 codes: for OCD, it’s F42.2; for Delusional Disorder, it’s F22; for Illness Anxiety Disorder, it’s F45.21; for Specific Phobia, it’s F40.298. Considering his history of tics, I’ll also list Persistent Motor Tic Disorder as F95.1. I need to finalize the order to ensure clarity.","1.

121,"Vincent Mancini, a 26-year-old single white man, was brought for an outpatient evaluation by his parents because they were distressed by his symptoms. Since age 13, he had been excessively preoccupied with his “scarred” skin, “thinning” hair, “asymmetrical” ears, and “wimpy” and “inadequately muscular” body build. Although he looked normal, Mr. Mancini was completely convinced that he looked “ugly and hideous,” and he believed that other people talked about him and made fun of him because of his appearance.

Mr. Mancini spent 5–6 hours a day compulsively checking his disliked body areas in mirrors and other reflecting surfaces such as windows, excessively styling his hair “to create an illusion of fullness,” pulling on his ears to try to “even them up,” and comparing his appearance with that of others. He compulsively picked his skin, sometimes using razor blades, to try to “clear it up.” He lifted weights daily and regularly wore several layers of T-shirts to look bigger. He almost always wore a cap to hide his hair. He had received dermatological treatment for his skin concerns but felt it had not helped.

Mr. Mancini missed several months of high school because he was too preoccupied to do schoolwork, felt compelled to leave class to check mirrors, and was too self-conscious to be seen by others; for these reasons, he was unable to attend college. He became socially withdrawn and did not date “because no girl would want to go out with someone as ugly as me.” He often considered suicide because he felt that life was not worth living “if I look like a freak” and because he felt isolated and ostracized because of his “ugliness.” His parents expressed concern over his “violent outbursts,” which occurred when he was feeling especially angry and distressed over how he looked or when they tried to pull him away from the mirror.

Mr. Mancini reported depressed mood, anhedonia, worthlessness, poor concentration, and suicidal ideation, all of which he attributed to his appearance concerns. To self-medicate his distress over his appearance, he drank alcohol and smoked marijuana. He used protein powder to “build up muscle” but denied use of anabolic steroids or other performance-enhancing drugs or drugs of abuse. He had distressing and problematic anxiety in social situations during his late teens that he attributed to feeling “stupid,” but he denied recent social anxiety that was unrelated to his appearance concerns.

Mr. Mancini had no significant medical history and was taking no medication. His mother had obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

Mr. Mancini was neatly dressed and groomed and wore a baseball cap. He had no obvious physical defects. His eye contact was poor. He was oriented and grossly cognitively intact. His affect was irritable; his mood was depressed, with passive suicidal ideation. He had no psychomotor abnormalities; his speech was normal. He was completely convinced that he was ugly and was certain that other people talked about him and laughed at him because of his physical appearance; he had no other psychotic symptoms. He believed his appearance “defects” were real and not attributable to a psychiatric disorder.","Body dysmorphic disorder, with absent insight/delusional beliefs, with muscle dysmorphia",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Clarifying diagnoses request**

The user asked for the top five diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes, implying they want a prioritized differential rather than just comorbidities. They specify a ""primary diagnosis and four secondary diagnoses,"" which could mean primary and comorbid or alternative ones. It's crucial to focus on differential diagnoses. While including comorbid MDD and SUD is possible, the primary should be the most likely, with secondary representing other plausible options. I just need to list the diagnoses without elaborate reasoning.

**Analyzing user instruction**

I need to carefully consider the user’s request regarding the clinical case vignette to provide a structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses. They want the top five likely diagnoses with corresponding ICD-10 F-codes, combining a primary diagnosis with four secondary ones. This focuses on differential diagnoses, potentially including comorbidities. Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) is clear. Other possibilities could be Major Depressive Disorder, OCD, delusional disorder, social anxiety disorder, or even an eating disorder. The preoccupation with body image might lead me to conclude muscle dysmorphia or somatic symptom disorder.

**Proposing differential diagnoses**

I see that the user is interested in a differential diagnosis list for a case. The individual might have compulsions without typical obsessions, which could lead to a misdiagnosis of OCD. Other possibilities include Delusional Disorder, Somatic Type, Social Anxiety Disorder, or Major Depressive Disorder. I need to include ICD-10 F-codes for clarity. My proposed list consists of Body Dysmorphic Disorder (F45.22), Major Depressive Disorder (F32.9), Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (F42.2), Delusional Disorder (F22), and Social Anxiety Disorder (F40.10).

**Considering substance use disorders**

I’m contemplating whether to include ""Cannabis Use Disorder"" or ""Alcohol Use Disorder"" since the individual might be self-medicating with substances, though it doesn't seem significant enough. The user asked for a structured list of diagnoses, with Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) as the primary. While OCD and Delusional Disorder don’t fit as primary, they can serve as differentials. I need to identify the top five likely diagnoses based on the information given: BDD, Major Depressive Disorder, and possibly Substance Use Disorders, Social Anxiety Disorder, and OCD.

**Choosing potential diagnoses**

I’m considering including diagnoses based on the user's criteria, focusing on Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) as the primary diagnosis. Other possibilities include Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Alcohol Use Disorder, Cannabis Use Disorder, and maybe Social Anxiety Disorder or OCD. It’s tricky because we need to be confident they meet the criteria for each. BDD and MDD seem likely, while substance use disorders might fit as secondary. I’ll rank them as BDD first, followed by MDD, Cannabis Use Disorder, Alcohol Use Disorder, and Social Anxiety Disorder, but I’m also debating including OCD instead of Social Anxiety.

**Determining the top diagnoses**

I need to clarify what the user wants regarding diagnoses versus differential. They requested a structured list of diagnoses with F-codes. While I want to consider symptoms and evidence, I shouldn't output my reasoning. The primary diagnosis is clearly Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD), followed by Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), and possibly Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Social Anxiety Disorder, and Delusional Disorder. Substance use disorders could be included but might not fit as strongly—so I’ll focus on these top five.

**Deciding on diagnoses and codes**

In ICD-10-CM, I’ve noted that for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), F42.2 is appropriate because most patients exhibit both obsessions and compulsions. For Delusional Disorder, I’ll use F22 since there's no specific subcode. Social Anxiety Disorder is coded as F40.10. I considered including other diagnoses but need to identify the top five likely conditions. This includes Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), and possibly substance use disorders due to self-medication behaviors. However, I’ll be cautious not to fabricate details without sufficient evidence.

**Finalizing diagnosis codes**

I’m deciding whether to include ""Cannabis use disorder"" since substance use is mentioned, but I need to ensure there's sufficient evidence. He shows signs of major depressive disorder too, with symptoms like suicidal ideation and irritability. The F-codes for diagnoses I’ll use are F45.22 for Body Dysmorphic Disorder, F32.9 for Major Depressive Disorder, F10.10 for Alcohol Use Disorder, F12.10 for Cannabis Use Disorder, and F40.10 for Social Anxiety Disorder. I think this should cover the top diagnoses the user needs.

**Selecting potential diagnoses**

I’m debating whether to classify some conditions, like delusional disorder and substance use disorders, as comorbidities or differentials. It makes sense to include ""Cannabis use disorder, unspecified"" and ""Alcohol use disorder, unspecified"" due to their relevance. I need to gather evidence for my top five most likely diagnoses. BDD is definitely primary; MDD is likely comorbid, while social anxiety and OCD might be differentials. Overall, adding MDD, Alcohol use disorder, Cannabis use disorder, and potentially Social anxiety to the list seems best!

**Finalizing diagnoses list**

I’m preparing to finalize a list of diagnoses based on the case details. I can include disorders like Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder due to time-consuming rituals, Delusional Disorder related to appearance, and Social Anxiety Disorder for avoidance issues. I'll also consider including Excoriation Disorder linked to skin-picking behavior. 

Here’s the crafted list of five diagnoses formatted as needed:

1. Body dysmorphic disorder (with absent insight/delusional beliefs; with muscle dysmorphia) - F45.22  
2. Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified - F32.9

122,"Wendy Nichols was a 47-year-old single white woman referred to a community mental health care team for the management of a mixed presentation of low mood and generalized anxiety. She had never taken any psychiatric medication but had completed a course of cognitive-behavioral therapy for a previous depressive episode 5 years earlier.

Ms. Nichols’s medical history was unremarkable. She lived alone in a two-bedroom apartment and had no family or friends nearby. She had a university degree and worked as a part-time sales assistant in a charity thrift shop. She said she had dated in college but had “somehow been too busy” in recent years.

On initial examination, she was an articulate, well-dressed woman who was coherent and cooperative. She was clearly in a low mood. She complained about poor concentration and difficulties getting organized. She denied any substance misuse.

The clinician noted that Ms. Nichols’s purse was filled with bills and other papers. When asked, the patient initially shrugged it off, indicating that she “carried around my office.” When the interviewer inquired further, it emerged that Ms. Nichols had had difficulty discarding important business papers, newspapers, and magazines for as long as she could remember. She felt that it all started when her mother got rid of her old toys when she was age 12. Now, many years later, Ms. Nichols’s apartment had become filled with books, stationery, crafts, plastic packages, cardboard boxes, and all sorts of other things. She said she knew it was a little crazy, but these items could be handy one day. She said, “Waste not, want not.” She also reported that many of her possessions were beautiful, unique, and irreplaceable, or had strong sentimental value. The thought of discarding any of these possessions caused her great distress.

Over a series of interviews, the clinician developed a clearer understanding of the extent of the problem. Rooms in Ms. Nichols’s apartment had begun to fill when she was in her early 30s, and by the time of the interview, she had little room to live. Her kitchen was almost entirely full, so she used a mini fridge and a toaster oven that she had wedged into piles of paper in the hallway. She ate her meals in the only available chair. At night, she moved a pile of papers from the bed onto that chair so she could sleep. Ms. Nichols continued to buy from the charity thrift store where she worked and also picked up daily free newspapers that she planned to read in the future.

Embarrassed by the condition of her apartment, she had told no one about her behavior and had invited no one into her apartment for at least 15 years. She also avoided social functions and dating, because—despite being naturally sociable and very lonely—she knew she would be unable to reciprocate with invitations to her home. She was surprised to have told the clinician, because she had not told even her own mother, but she would like help. She declined the clinician’s offer of a home visit or a telehealth visit but did offer some photographs of her living room from her telephone’s camera. The photographs showed furniture, papers, boxes, and clothes piled from floor to ceiling.

Ms. Nichols described long-standing feelings of sadness and loneliness, as well as anxiety whenever she tried to clean up or whenever someone tried to befriend her. She denied other psychiatric symptoms, including delusions, hallucinations, obsessions, and compulsive behavior.","1. Hoarding disorder, with excessive acquisition, with good or fair insight
2. Unspecified depressive disorder",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Clarifying depressive disorder codes**

I'm trying to figure out which coding to use since some might not accept letter-coded codes. They asked about ""F-codes,"" which aren't just numeric. To be cautious, I think F32.9, referring to unspecified depressive disorder, might be a good choice, but it feels a bit inaccurate.

I checked the DSM-5-TR, and F32.9 is indeed used for unspecified depressive disorder. There are some mapping issues, though, since DSM-5 refers to it as the same, but the nuances confuse me.

**Recalling diagnostic codes**

I'm reviewing various diagnostic codes for depressive disorders. Here’s what I've got:

- Major depressive disorder, single episode: 296.xx (F32.x)
- Major depressive disorder, recurrent: 296.xx (F33.x)
- Persistent depressive disorder: 300.4 (F34.1)
- Premenstrual dysphoric disorder: 625.4 (N94.3)
- Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder: 296.99 (F34.81)
- Unspecified depressive disorder: 311 (F32.9)
- Other specified depressive disorder: 311 (F32.8)

It looks like using F32.9 for unspecified depressive disorder is fine. For anxiety, unspecified anxiety disorder is 300.00 (F41.9). I’m considering what to specify for social anxiety and generalized anxiety, making sure my choices reflect her situation appropriately without being redundant.

**Considering anxiety and diagnoses**

I’m considering how to approach listing anxiety disorders. If I mention social anxiety, unspecified anxiety could cover other types, like cleaning anxiety, which is tied to hoarding behaviors. However, since cleaning anxiety isn’t typical, I might list Generalized Anxiety Disorder as comorbid due to her specific worries about items and discarding.

To create a structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses, I need plausible differentials for hoarding. Possible options include:

- Major Depressive Disorder (F33.1)
- Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (F60.5)
- Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (F90.0) 
- Depressive Disorder Unspecified (F32.9) 

Just need to ensure it aligns with the instructions!

**Examining comorbid diagnoses**

I’m trying to find the right way to include comorbid diagnoses while avoiding duplicates. Listing OCD and hoarding both under F42 might be odd, so I could consider hoarding disorder as the primary diagnosis. 

Then, I could look at ""Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent,"" possibly F33.0 or F33.1. I do need to consider that she’s been referred for managing low mood and generalized anxiety, with a history of a previous depressive episode. However, I’m not sure about the severity or number of symptoms, making it tricky to determine the exact diagnosis.

**Evaluating diagnostic codes and comorbidity**

I'm analyzing the symptoms and considering diagnostic codes for the patient. She has a low mood, poor concentration, and anxiety related to cleaning. While she denies other psychiatric symptoms, her experiences may indicate a mix of depression and anxiety, possibly linked to hoarding disorder.

I could list the primary diagnosis as Hoarding Disorder (F42.3), followed by Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent (potentially F33.0) and relevant anxiety disorders. I need to ensure I'm using the most accurate ICD-10-CM codes, focusing on F42.3 for hoarding, and considering ADHD due to her reported disorganization. It's essential to confirm these details to provide a clear, accurate diagnosis!

**Confirming diagnostic codes and comorbidities**

I'm assessing diagnostic codes for different conditions. DSM-5-TR might still be using similar codes but could list hoarding disorder as F42.3. I need to ensure accuracy regarding other conditions like social anxiety disorder (F40.10), generalized anxiety disorder (F41.1), and unspecified depressive disorder, which may depend on whether we use F32.9 or F32.A.

Given her symptoms, I could include hoarding disorder, unspecified depressive disorder, social anxiety disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. However, I should be cautious about redundancy and prioritize the most relevant diagnoses, ensuring they reflect her situation accurately.

**Evaluating diagnoses and symptoms**

I'm reflecting on the vignette emphasizing low mood and generalized anxiety. It suggests that hoarding disorder may be related to depression and anxiety. I'm considering a few diagnoses: hoarding disorder (F42.3), social anxiety disorder (F40.10), unspecified depressive disorder (F32.9), generalized anxiety disorder (F41.1), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (F90.0).

I'm weighing ADHD as a plausible diagnosis due to her disorganization and procrastination. Alternatively, her persistent feelings of sadness might qualify her for major depressive disorder, but there are insufficient criteria, so unspecified depressive disorder seems safer. We need to finalize these top diagnoses while ensuring they truly represent her situation.

**Analyzing potential diagnoses**

I'm focusing on the requested structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses. It seems likely that hoarding disorder is the primary diagnosis, along with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and possibly ADHD. 

The depressive symptoms indicate low mood, poor concentration, and feelings of loneliness, but lack other typical symptoms for a major depressive episode. Social anxiety appears relevant due to her avoidance of social situations, but there's also room to consider avoidant personality disorder. ADHD is another possibility since she has had ongoing organization challenges. However, her situation may point more towards issues stemming from hoarding rather than a distinct personality disorder.

**Finalizing a diagnosis list**

To diagnose ADHD, we need at least five symptoms that have persisted for six months and affected functioning, and the symptoms must have started before age 12. Since we don't have that information, it’s uncertain. We might consider Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD) as a differential due to potential overlap with hoarding, but the necessary characteristics aren't clear.

Instead, I’ll propose a list of the top five diagnoses that includes hoarding disorder, persistent depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and ADHD. Persistent depressive disorder seems more fitting due to her long-standing sadness. I think hoarding is the primary issue here, with the rest being secondary.

**Evaluating diagnostic possibilities**

I need to consider that hoarding might blur lines with ADHD since organizing can be affected by both. While obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) could be related to hoarding, the rigid traits aren’t clearly described here, making it less likely. I can list hoarding disorder as primary along with unspecified depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and ADHD as secondary diagnoses. 

I think the safest approach is to include unspecified disorders rather than committing to specific categories unless the criteria are clearly met.

**Determining psychiatric diagnoses**

The case involves a patient with low mood and generalized anxiety who has a history of hoarding disorder. While major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder are options, it's safest to categorize them as unspecified due to unclear criteria. I’ll list hoarding disorder as the primary diagnosis (F42.3) and consider unspecified depressive disorder (F32.9) alongside unspecified anxiety disorder (F41.9) and social anxiety disorder (F40.10). ADHD (F90.0) remains plausible but maybe not as likely based on the evidence available.

**Finalizing psychiatric diagnoses**

To finalize the top five diagnoses, I'm considering the following. First, we have hoarding disorder (F42.3) as the primary diagnosis. For secondary diagnoses, we could include unspecified depressive disorder (F32.9), social anxiety disorder (F40.10), unspecified anxiety disorder (F41.9), and possibly ADHD (F90.0). However, I'm feeling that there’s more justification for including social anxiety due to her avoidance of social functions, while keeping depression in the mix feels appropriate given her low mood and long-standing sadness. Overall, it’s a balancing act to ensure that we don't overdiagnose.

**Deciding on diagnoses**

I'm contemplating the best way to list the top five diagnoses for this case. Given the details provided, here's what I'm considering: Hoarding disorder (F42.3) should definitely be primary. For secondary diagnoses, I can include unspecified depressive disorder (F32.9), social anxiety disorder (F40.10), and perhaps generalized anxiety disorder (F41.1). 

Although I initially thought of adding avoidant personality disorder or ADHD, I feel stronger about the need for the anxiety diagnosis and its relevance here. It's challenging to pack everything into five clear, separate diagnoses, but I think I'm close!

**Finalizing diagnoses**

I'm weighing the best approach to finalize the diagnoses. First, I think we should definitely include hoarding disorder (F42.3) as the primary diagnosis. For the secondary diagnoses, I'll add unspecified depressive disorder (F32.9) and generalized anxiety disorder (F41.1). Since social anxiety disorder (F40.10) is relevant too, I’m inclined to keep that. As for ADHD (F90.0), I’m less certain, but it aligns with the symptoms. 

Ranking-wise, the order will be hoarding, depression, GAD, social anxiety, and then ADHD. This way, we have a cohesive list that reflects the complexity of her situation!

**Deciding on diagnoses**

I'm concluding the diagnoses now, noting that the first will definitely be hoarding disorder (F42.3). For the second, I lean towards unspecified depressive disorder (F32.9) because her low mood is apparent. I’m also considering social anxiety disorder (F40.10) since her avoidance indicates struggles in social situations, and generalized anxiety disorder (F41.1) could apply, too. ADHD (F90.0) seems less likely but is still a potential. 

My final list is hoarding, unspecified depression, social anxiety, generalized anxiety, and ADHD.

**Listing final diagnoses**

I'm working on finalizing the diagnoses. First, I'd include hoarding disorder, which has the primary code of F42.3. Next is unspecified depressive disorder (F32.9) due to her current low mood. Then, I'd list social anxiety disorder (F40.10) since she has avoidance behavior related to social situations. For anxiety, I think I'll use generalized anxiety disorder (F41.1) rather than unspecified, as it's mentioned in the prompt. Lastly, I'd include ADHD, specifically the predominantly inattentive presentation (F90.0). 

My final list is:
1. Hoarding Disorder - F42.3
2. Unspecified Depressive Disorder - F32.9
3. Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia) - F40.10
4. Generalized Anxiety Disorder - F41.1
5. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Predominantly Inattentive Presentation - F90.0

**Finalizing diagnoses list**

I'm thinking about how to finalize the diagnoses correctly. Hoarding disorder should definitely be my primary diagnosis since it's a major cause of impairment here. Then I want to include unspecified depressive disorder (F32.9) and social anxiety disorder (F40.10) as well. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is also plausible, so I'll list it next (F41.1), followed finally by ADHD, predominantly inattentive presentation (F90.0). 

Here’s my structured final list:

123,"Zoe Oliver was a 22-year-old single woman who presented to her general practitioner after reading a magazine article about trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder). She had never previously told anyone other than her mother about her hair pulling, but the magazine had indicated that it was fairly common and treatable. She was pessimistic that anything would work, but she and her mother agreed that she should seek help.

Ms. Oliver’s hair pulling most often took place as a ritual when she returned home from her job as a paralegal. She would search for hairs of a particular texture from the crown of her head (though she also pulled from her eyebrows, eyelashes, and pubic region). She felt intense relief if the hair came out with its root. She would then typically bite off the root of the hair and swallow the rest of the hair. She had never experienced any gastrointestinal symptoms after hair swallowing. She said the hair pulling had begun at age 12, and she had never known anyone with similar behaviors.

Ms. Oliver fought hard to stop the behavior and, at times, had been able to stop for several months at a time. When the hair pulling returned, she would again feel ashamed and angry at herself. Scarves and hats covered the bald patch, but she would usually withdraw from friends and boyfriends to avoid being caught.

Even when demoralized about the behavior, Ms. Oliver did not have vegetative symptoms of depression. Aside from fears of being found out, she lacked prominent anxiety. She denied obsessions, compulsions, hoarding, tics, and preoccupations with either bodily defects or having an illness. She also had no history of a range of other body-focused repetitive behaviors, such as lip biting or cheek chewing, in either herself or her close family members.

When asked what she would do if she could not find the “right” kind of hair to pull, she admitted that she would often pick at her skin or at a scab. The scab’s coming off in just the right way led to a feeling of relief that was similar to that which she experienced when hair pulling. She would also sometimes chew and swallow her scabs. Ms. Oliver often picked at scabs on her back so that the lesions would not be easily visible to others. Nevertheless, the resultant scarring did lead her to avoid situations like beach parties and dates and other situations where her behavior might be exposed.","1. Trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder)
2. Excoriation (skin-picking) disorder",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Reviewing pica coding**

I'm checking my memory regarding pica coding in ICD-10-CM. For adults, pica is F50.89, and for children, it's F98.3. I can recall another code: ""F50.89 Other specified eating disorder"" and ""F50.8 Other eating disorders,"" too. In DSM-5, pica is 307.52, while for rumination disorder, I think it's 307.53, but I'm not completely sure. I want to be accurate with these codes. F50.89 might be the right code for pica in adults, but I need to double-check.

**Analyzing potential diagnoses**

I'm considering a diagnosis related to someone who started eating hair and scabs non-nutritively at age 12. For a pica diagnosis, I know the behavior has to persist for at least one month and meet several criteria, like being inappropriate for their developmental level and not culturally supported. Here, the behavior seems tied to trichotillomania and excoriation, but I’m not sure if it requires additional clinical attention. There are no GI symptoms, but there could be risks. I guess I should explore other possible diagnoses like obsessive-compulsive or social anxiety disorders.

**Evaluating anxiety and disorders**

It seems this individual doesn't have broad fears but may fear negative evaluation. If her avoidance is due to embarrassment, that might fit social anxiety. However, since the vignette notes she lacks prominent anxiety beyond that, I wonder if it really meets the criteria. I’m exploring other possibilities like body dysmorphic disorder, but she denies being preoccupied with her appearance, and it’s more about shame than defects. Avoidant personality disorder and generalized anxiety disorder seem unlikely. Obsessive-compulsive disorder could be a consideration due to repetitive hair-pulling, but she also denies any obsessions or compulsions.

**Identifying potential disorders**

I’m considering a range of disorders for hair pulling. Impulse-control disorder seems possible since hair pulling fits under Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders (OCRD). Stereotypic movement disorder might also be relevant but is typically developmental, which doesn't quite fit here. I won't make up specific details, but I can suggest ""Other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder"" related to body-focused repetitive behaviors. I guess I’ll narrow it down to a top five: trichotillomania, excoriation disorder, and others, including social anxiety disorder, but I’m questioning if that's appropriate.

**Determining diagnostic possibilities**

I'm weighing various disorders for someone who avoids friends and feels embarrassed about her behaviors but lacks prominent anxiety. She might meet criteria for social anxiety disorder specifically related to her appearance, like scars from pulling hair, though it might not be strong enough to classify as a disorder. I'm considering other diagnoses like adjustment disorder due to stress or obsessive-compulsive disorder. 

I need to provide a solid list of five plausible diagnoses, so I'll include trichotillomania, excoriation disorder, and other specified obsessive-compulsive disorders. I’ll double-check the ICD-10 codes for accuracy.

**Analyzing potential diagnoses**

I’m considering the criteria for excoriation disorder, which involves recurrent skin picking resulting in lesions and typically requires repeated attempts to stop. While it's not explicitly stated if the individual has attempted to stop, her distress from hiding scars does suggest impairment. 

I’m also exploring trichotillomania, pica, and other specified obsessive-compulsive disorders as possibilities. It's crucial to provide a structured list of diagnoses along with their corresponding ICD-10 codes, including trichotillomania (F63.3), excoriation disorder (F42.4), and so on. I'll ensure the accuracy of these codes.

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

I need to compile a structured list of the top five most likely DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses based on the information provided. The first diagnosis will be trichotillomania (F63.3), followed by excoriation disorder (F42.4). I'll also include other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder for behaviors like dermatophagia (F42.8), social anxiety disorder (F40.10), and potentially pica-like behavior coded as F50.89. I'll just ensure to keep the list concise and use the correct F-codes without any additional explanations.

**Evaluating possible diagnoses**

I need to consider various diagnoses for the case at hand. While the idea of body dysmorphic disorder comes to mind, the client denies preoccupations. Pica and other specified obsessive-compulsive disorders might come up due to behaviors like scab chewing. I'm thinking of a strong focus on trichotillomania and excoriation disorder, which are well-supported. For the fifth diagnosis, I'm leaning towards social anxiety disorder because of her avoidance behaviors, although it may also fit under other specified anxiety disorder. Let's finalize this list of five diagnoses.

**Finalizing diagnosis codes**

I'm confirming the appropriate codes to use for the diagnoses. For the 22-year-old, I'll use F50.89 for pica according to DSM-5 guidelines. I’ll ensure the format is correct, with each line structured as ""1. <Primary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code."" For trichotillomania, the code is F63.3, while social anxiety disorder is F40.10. I’ll finalize the list with the required codes, avoiding any extraneous details:

1. Trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) - F63.3  
2. Excoriation (skin-picking) disorder - F42.4  
3. Other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (body-focused repetitive behavior disorder) - F42.8

124,"Adriana was a 4-year-old girl referred to an early childhood mental health care clinic for evaluation of “dangerous behaviors.” The parents were particularly concerned that Adriana maintained poor boundaries, was impulsive, and was too quick to trust strangers.

Adriana had been adopted from an Eastern European orphanage at age 29 months. At the time of the adoption, Adriana’s medical records were reviewed by a local pediatrician, who found no problems aside from growth parameters that were all below the 5th percentile. When the adoptive parents met her at the orphanage, Adriana approached without shyness and visited easily with them. The parents had been pleasantly reassured by the child’s happy demeanor and her spontaneous, warm hugs.

Not long after her adoption, Adriana began to clearly seek out her mother for comfort when distressed or hurt. At most other times, however, Adriana did not distinguish between strangers and her family. In the grocery store, she would warmly hug whoever was waiting next to them in line. In group and family settings, she would frequently try to sit in the laps of people she had barely met. Once, at a shopping mall, she tried to leave with another family. Her parents were concerned that this behavior might put her at risk of abduction or abuse.

Compared with other children her age, Adriana had trouble taking turns and sitting for circle time at school. She interrupted, intruded into classmates’ play space, and occasionally hit others. Small triggers upset her for prolonged periods. She had trouble soothing herself but would generally calm down if held by her teacher or a parent.

Adriana lived with her adoptive mother and father and her 12-year-old brother, who was the biological child of her parents. Her mother stayed home for Adriana’s first year in the United States, but Adriana had been attending a half-day child care program for the past year. Her mother noted progress in the child’s development, although she remained language delayed, with comprehension better than productive language. She was slower than classmates in developing school readiness skills, but her gross and fine motor skills were considered average. Her sleep and appetite were fine. She had gained weight, but her head circumference remained just below the 5th percentile.

On examination, she was a pleasant, well-groomed girl who appeared younger than her age. She spoke little but did appear to pay attention to the interviewer. Within a few minutes, she tried to crawl onto the interviewer’s lap.",Disinhibited social engagement disorder,dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Considering ADHD diagnosis options**

For ""Unspecified attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,"" the code is F90.9, while F90.1 is for ""ADHD, predominantly hyperactive/impulsive."" It seems choosing the correct diagnosis is vital. I might lean towards ""Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, predominantly hyperactive/impulsive presentation."" DSED appears suitable, but ""Autism spectrum disorder"" might be less likely despite some relevant traits. ""Social (pragmatic) communication disorder"" doesn't seem applicable, and ""Unspecified communication disorder"" feels too broad. Should I consider ""Unspecified neurodevelopmental disorder"" F89 if needed?

**Clarifying diagnosis codes**

""Stereotypic movement disorder"" might not fit here. The guidelines instruct me to follow a rubric for differential diagnosis but to avoid sharing my clinical reasoning. Instead, I need a structured list of diagnoses with their corresponding F-codes. So, I’ll make sure all diagnoses are DSM-5-TR compliant. DSED, ADHD, and global developmental delay are good, but I must confirm that ""Expressive language disorder"" is indeed not in DSM-5, which calls it ""Language disorder."" The ICD-10 code for expressive language disorder is F80.1, while DSM-5's code is F80.2.

**Confirming language disorder codes**

It looks like DSM-5 uses the ICD-10 code F80.2 for ""Language disorder,"" which includes both receptive and expressive language issues. Some clinicians still refer to ""expressive language disorder,"" but in DSM-5, it's not a separate diagnosis. We need to code it as F80.2. But then I wonder if it’s also valid to code F80.1? The vignette talks about expressive language being more than receptive, yet DSM-5 requires a general ""Language disorder"" diagnosis. The code for that seems to be F80.9. Let's verify these details further.

**Clarifying communication disorder codes**

I need to consider ""Unspecified communication disorder"" (307.9, F80.9) and ""Language disorder"" (F80.2). Since the patient shows a language delay but has better comprehension than production, I think ""Language disorder"" fits best with DSM-5-TR. Expressive language disorder isn't a formal term in DSM-5-TR despite being commonly used, so sticking with ""Language disorder"" is the way to go. For global developmental delay, the DSM-5 term is F88, and I confirm ADHD hyperactive/impulsive is F90.1. I'll finalize the list now!

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

1. Disinhibited social engagement disorder - F94.2  
2. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, predominantly hyperactive/impulsive presentation - F90.1  
3. Language disorder - F80.2  
4. Global developmental delay - F88  
5. Other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder - F91.8

125,"Traumatic Event: Bethany Pinsky, age 23, had gone to a theater to see the local premiere of a big-budget movie. As she settled into her seat, waiting for the show to begin, a young man in a ski mask suddenly appeared in front of the screen. Brandishing an assault rifle, he fired directly into the audience. She saw many people get shot, including the woman sitting next to her. People all around began screaming, and there was a confused stampede for the exit door. Terrified, she somehow fought her way to the exit and escaped, uninjured, to the parking lot, where police cars were just arriving.

Charles Quigley, age 25, went to the same movie theater at the same time. He too feared for his life. Hiding behind a row of seats, he was able to crawl to the aisle and sprint to the exit. Although covered in blood, he escaped without physical injury.

Bethany and Charles, 2 Days Later: Two days later, both Ms. Pinsky and Mr. Quigley considered themselves “nervous wrecks.” Grateful that they were alive and uninjured, they nevertheless found themselves extremely anxious and on edge. They jumped at the slightest noise. They kept watching television for the latest information about the shooting, but every time there was actual videotaped footage of the event, they experienced panic attacks, broke out into a sweat, were unable to calm down, and could not stop thinking about the traumatic event. They could not sleep at night because of nightmares, and during the day they felt assaulted by intrusive and unwelcome memories of gunshots, screams, and their own personal terror during the event.

Bethany, 2 Weeks Later: Ms. Pinsky had reclaimed most of her pretraumatic thoughts, feelings, and behaviors within 2 weeks. Although traumatic reminders of the shooting sometimes led to a brief panic or physiological reaction, these did not dominate her waking hours. She no longer experienced nightmares. She knew that she would never forget what happened in that movie theater, but for the most part, her life was returning to normal and had returned to the trajectory it had been following before the shootings occurred.

Charles, 2 Weeks Later: Mr. Quigley had not recovered 2 weeks later. He felt emotionally constricted and unable to experience pleasant or positive feelings. He jumped at the slightest sound, he was unable to focus on his work, and his sleep was fitful and marked by traumatic nightmares. He tried to avoid any reminders of the shootings but nevertheless relentlessly recalled the sound of gunfire, the screams, and the sticky feel of the blood pouring out of his neighbor’s chest and onto him as he hid behind the seats. He felt episodically disconnected from his surroundings and from himself. He viewed his life as having been changed by this traumatic experience.","Ms. Pinsky: No diagnosis; normative stress reaction

Mr. Quigley: Acute stress disorder",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Analyzing diagnoses**

I need to determine the top 5 diagnoses, starting with PTSD, but we can only list confirmed diagnoses rather than rule-outs. ""Posttraumatic stress disorder, provisional"" might not align with DSM guidelines, as that specifier doesn't exist. I realize I can note ""PTSD, provisional"" if the symptoms have lasted less than a month. 

For Charles, I could mention Acute Stress Disorder, while for Bethany, perhaps Acute Stress Disorder (resolved). Still, I need to ensure we include five diagnoses overall, potentially treating it as a vignette for both.

**Clarifying diagnosis structure**

I’m contemplating whether to diagnose each character individually or to approach it as a whole vignette. The instructions say to provide a structured list of DSM-5-TR diagnoses, potentially leading to two diagnoses: Bethany may have Acute Stress Disorder that remitted, while Charles has the same. But we need five diagnoses. 

Charles’s situation could be explored for Panic Disorder due to panic attacks from footage—but that doesn’t fit. Maybe I could consider ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder"" for Bethany, though she recovered quickly and may not meet full criteria for the diagnosis.

**Examining symptom duration**

At 2 days, the symptoms haven't met the requirement for Acute Stress Disorder (ASD), which needs a minimum of 3 days. If by 2 weeks symptoms persisted for at least 3 days, then she could qualify. She experienced intrusion, nightmares, and hyperarousal at 2 days, but by 2 weeks, she mostly recovered, even if some symptoms lingered. If it persisted with distress, like sleep problems, she might still meet criteria for ASD, yet I can't assume duration beyond 2 days. By then, life was returning to normal.

**Determining ASD diagnoses**

For Acute Stress Disorder (ASD), symptoms need to last at least 3 days but no more than 1 month. It’s plausible she had symptoms for 3 days, but it’s not explicit. Typically, both characters would have ASD initially; Bethany recovers, while Charles may develop PTSD. For Charles, I'd list Acute Stress Disorder as primary. For Bethany, while ""Acute stress disorder (in full remission)"" isn't officially recognized in DSM, I could consider ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder"" if her duration was under 3 days. I should focus on providing the top five probable diagnoses based on the information I have.

**Structuring potential diagnoses**

The term ""diagnoses"" implies that conditions must be met, but we have two individuals here. I should analyze the vignette carefully. At 2 days post-trauma, both showed symptoms of hypervigilance and panic. By 2 weeks, Bethany had mostly regained her composure while Charles was still struggling with more persistent symptoms. This aligns with Acute Stress Disorder (ASD), which requires symptoms from multiple categories. 

For Charles, I can list Acute Stress Disorder as the primary diagnosis. As for Bethany, while she has an acute stress reaction, it may not meet full ASD criteria, so I’ll consider potential secondary diagnoses, ensuring I provide the top five likely diagnoses overall.

**Listing potential diagnoses**

Okay, I'm working with ICD-10 F codes for this case. F43.0 corresponds to Acute Stress Reaction. For Bethany, if her symptoms lasted less than 3 days, I could classify her as having ""Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder"" (F43.8) or possibly unspecified (F43.9). It's likely we need separate diagnoses for both individuals.

I should provide a structured list of the five most likely psychiatric diagnoses based on the information presented. Here’s what I’m considering:

1. Acute Stress Disorder (F43.0) — primary for Charles.
2. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (F43.10) — potential secondary.
3. Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder (F43.8).
4. Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety (F43.22).
5. Panic Disorder (F41.0).

This keeps it aligned with the DSM-5 criteria and ensures I follow the instructions!

**Choosing plausible diagnoses**

I need to evaluate plausible diagnoses based on the features presented. Acute Stress Disorder fits clearly. For PTSD, although symptoms exist, they haven't persisted for more than a month, so it can't be fully diagnosed yet.

Adjustment Disorder may apply to Bethany, but since her symptoms could meet Acute Stress Disorder criteria, I need to be cautious. 

Unspecified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder could apply if symptoms last less than 3 days. Panic Disorder doesn't fit well, nor do other anxiety-related conditions. 

I can consider including Acute Stress Disorder as the primary diagnosis for Charles, followed by secondary options like PTSD, Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder, and Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety.

**Refining potential diagnoses**

To accurately categorize diagnoses, I first note that Panic Disorder requires recurrent attacks and persistent worry, which don’t apply here. While I’m considering Acute Stress Disorder as the primary diagnosis for both individuals, I need three additional secondary diagnoses.

I could list Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder for Bethany, along with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder as a potential since symptoms may persist longer. Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety could fit as well, but strictly speaking, it may overlap with the other options. 

I’d like to ensure I select the right ICD-10 codes for each too.

**Determining likely diagnoses**

I've been considering the required diagnoses, and it seems that at two weeks, Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) fits best as the primary diagnosis rather than PTSD, since the latter isn't fully met yet.

For Bethany, she might not meet the criteria for ASD after two weeks, which leaves me considering Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder due to improved symptoms, and PTSD as a potential secondary.

I’ll list both Acute Stress Disorder and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, alongside Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety and Unspecified Anxiety Disorder, as options for possible diagnoses.

**Ranking likely diagnoses**

I need to focus on the primary diagnoses based on symptoms and timing. At two weeks, Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) seems to apply best, particularly for Charles, while Bethany might not require a definitive diagnosis due to her improvement.

I'll list the top five diagnoses: 
1. Acute Stress Disorder - F43.0
2. Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder - F43.8 (for Bethany)
3. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder - F43.10 (as a potential future diagnosis)
4. Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety - F43.22
5. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder - F41.9 

I’ll ensure these reflect their situations accurately!

**Organizing diagnoses for Bethany**

I’d prioritize Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) as the first diagnosis. For Bethany, while she may not currently meet symptoms, it’s possible she had early symptoms indicative of ASD that have since resolved.

Here’s my proposed list of top diagnoses:
1. Acute Stress Disorder - F43.0
2. Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder - F43.8 (for subthreshold symptoms)
3. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder - F43.10 (if symptoms last over a month)
4. Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety - F43.22
5. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder - F41.9

I’ll also ensure that all these fit within the DSM-5-TR framework!

**Considering diagnostic criteria**

I’m thinking that the diagnosis at two days might suggest ""acute stress reaction,"" but wait—maybe that doesn’t align with the DSM criteria. It’s important to consider how acute stress reactions are defined and whether they fit within what the DSM outlines. I want to make sure I'm looking closely at both the symptoms and the classification system to ensure it’s accurate and appropriate. There's definitely more to unpack here!

**Confirming disorder codes**

I want to make sure that ""Depersonalization/derealization disorder"" is indeed coded as F48.1. Yes, that's right in the DSM-5-TR. It's categorized under Dissociative Disorders, and the ICD-10-CM code is also F48.1. That’s good to confirm! Alternatively, I could consider ""Unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder,"" which is coded as F43.9, but I’m weighing the plausibility of each based on available data. Let's see which fits better!

**Considering diagnosis formatting**

I want to align with the rubric level 5, which requires subtle cues and nuanced patterns. The user is asking to ""diagnose the following clinical case vignette,"" which suggests they might want diagnoses for both Bethany and Charles. However, since I need a single list of five diagnoses, I’ll need to phrase them in a way that indicates the respective patient, like ""Acute stress disorder (Charles)."" Including parenthetical qualifiers could be helpful while staying within the requested format. So, I'll aim for clarity without adding unnecessary reasoning.

**Refining diagnosis list**

The vignette mentions panic attacks triggered by trauma footage, which are symptoms rather than separate diagnoses. I need to ensure I select the final diagnoses with the correct codes. My initial list includes:

1. Acute stress disorder - F43.0
2. Posttraumatic stress disorder - F43.10
3. Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder - F43.8
4. Adjustment disorder with anxiety - F43.22
5. Depersonalization/derealization disorder - F48.1

However, I’m reconsidering the ranking—maybe PTSD should be second or third? I should rank by likelihood but keep in mind they only asked for the top five without focusing solely on present symptoms.

**Crafting final response**

I'm feeling a bit unsure about placing ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder"" in the second position. I want to make sure I'm presenting the information correctly, but I think it’s okay for now. Let’s just focus on creating the final response, keeping it straightforward and clear without getting too caught up in the reasoning behind the order. Alright, let’s get this crafted!","1.

126,"Dylan, a 15-year-old high school student, was referred to a psychiatrist for help in dealing with stress from being involved in a serious automobile accident 2 weeks earlier. On the day of the accident, Dylan was riding in the front passenger seat when, as the car was pulling out of a driveway, it was struck by an oncoming SUV that was speeding through a yellow light. The car he was in was hit squarely on the driver’s side, which caused the car to roll over once and come to rest right side up. The collision of metal on metal made an extremely loud noise. The driver of the car, a high school classmate, was knocked unconscious for a short period and was bleeding from a gash in his forehead. Upon seeing his injured friend, Dylan became afraid that his friend might be dead. His friend in the back seat of the car was frantically trying to unlatch her seat belt. Dylan’s door was jammed, and Dylan feared that their car might catch fire while he was stuck in it. After a few minutes, the driver, Dylan, and the other passenger were able to exit through the passenger doors and move away from the car. They realized that the driver of the SUV was unharmed and had already called the police. An ambulance was on its way. All three were transported to a local emergency room, where they were attended to and released to their parents’ care after a few hours.

Dylan had not had a good night’s sleep since the accident. He often awoke in the middle of the night with his heart racing, visualizing oncoming headlights. He was having trouble concentrating and was unable to effectively complete his homework. His parents, who had begun to drive him to and from school, noticed that he was anxious every time they pulled out of a driveway or crossed an intersection. Although he had recently received his driving permit, he refused to practice driving with his father. He was also unusually short-tempered with his parents, his younger sisters, and his friends. He had recently gone to see a movie but had walked out of the theater before the movie started; he complained that the sound system was too loud. His concerned parents tried to talk to him about his stress, but he would irritably cut them off. After doing poorly on an important exam, however, he accepted the encouragement of a favorite teacher to go to a psychiatrist.

When seen, Dylan described additional difficulties. He hated that he was “jumpy” around loud noises, and he could not shake the image of his injured and unresponsive friend. He had waves of anger toward the driver of the SUV. He reported feeling embarrassed and disappointed in himself for being reluctant to practice driving. He stated that about 5 years earlier, he had witnessed the near-drowning of one of his younger sisters. Also, he mentioned that this past month was the first anniversary of his grandfather’s death.",Acute stress disorder,dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Clarifying mental health codes**

I’m thinking about the differences between ICD-10 and DSM-5-TR regarding acute stress disorders. ICD-10 code F43.0 is for acute stress reaction, while for acute stress disorder in ICD-10-CM also F43.0 applies. PTSD is coded as F43.10, and adjustment disorder with anxiety is F43.22. When considering secondary diagnoses, I look at things like ""unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder"" and check for comorbidities like insomnia disorder, which requires specific criteria I might not meet.

**Evaluating anxiety and stress disorders**

I’m assessing a situation involving someone who has visualized oncoming headlights, possibly indicating re-experiencing rather than nightmares. There might be an ""anxiety disorder, unspecified"" (F41.9), but they already have acute stress disorder (ASD). Panic disorder or specific phobia don't seem to fit either. I consider generalized anxiety disorder, but that requires six months. Noting that they meet ASD criteria, I may include ""posttraumatic stress disorder, provisional"" as a secondary option. I also need to aim for five diagnoses while considering PTSD as a rule-out.

**Identifying potential diagnoses**

I'm brainstorming a structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses. For the primary diagnosis, I could list ""Acute stress disorder"" and consider ""Posttraumatic stress disorder"" for potential progression, even though he doesn’t meet the duration criterion. I think about including a provisional specifier, which isn’t a separate diagnosis but useful when full criteria aren’t met. I could also code PTSD as F43.10 as a secondary option or consider ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder."" Ultimately, I believe he meets the criteria for ""Acute stress disorder.""

**Listing potential secondary diagnoses**

I’m considering secondary diagnoses, which might include ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder,"" though he likely meets the full criteria already. ""Unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder"" (F43.9) isn't needed if ASD is established. I can’t use Z-codes for psychosocial issues either. ""Other specified depressive disorder"" (F32.89) might not fit, but I still need five diagnoses. So I'll include plausible comorbidities and differentials, like PTSD, adjustment disorder, specific phobia, and panic disorder, prioritizing them for the list.

**Finalizing the diagnosis list**

I’m refining my list of potential diagnoses, starting with ""Acute stress disorder"" as the primary diagnosis. I’m considering ""Posttraumatic stress disorder (provisional)"" due to timing issues, alongside ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety"" (F43.22) and possibly ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" or ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" (F41.8). I’m also evaluating the inclusion of ""Specific phobia, situational type"" (F40.248) and the relevance of ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder."" I’m checking ICD-10 codes for accuracy and aiming to keep the list straightforward and relevant.

**Finalizing diagnostic codes**

I'm checking the official DSM-5-TR and ICD-10-CM codes for specific phobia. To keep the list relevant, I’m considering “Specific phobia, situational type” (F40.248) for driving fears. Next, I’ll evaluate other potential diagnoses like ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety"" (F43.22) and ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" (F41.9). My focus is on ""Acute stress disorder"" (F43.0) as the primary diagnosis, with corresponding provisional diagnosis codes for PTSD, phobia, and anxiety. I’m striving for clarity and relevance in this structured list!

**Compiling diagnostic codes**

127,"Eric Reynolds, a 75-year-old retired electrician, sought help at the Veterans Affairs outpatient mental health care clinic because of his “very short fuse” and tendency to be “easily triggered.” Mr. Reynolds indicated that he had had these symptoms for decades, but that he had finally agreed to get treated because his wife seemed desperate that he get in better control.

Mr. Reynolds indicated that he always felt on guard, especially while in public. When unexpectedly startled by sudden noises, he tended to fly into a rage. That was apparently one reason he had chosen to be a self-employed electrician: he could work by himself. Similarly, he enjoyed hunting and gardening, activities that he could enjoy in quiet solitude.

Reluctantly, he described intrusive memories of watching his fellow soldiers die in the field, which caused him enormous shame, guilt, and sadness, Several times a week, he awakes in a panicky sweat after a combat nightmare, although, as he said, “It’s ridiculous. Those guys have been dead for 50 years.”

Although these symptoms are very distressing, Mr. Reynolds is most worried about his “hair-trigger” temper. Without cause, he finds himself antagonizing other drivers who cut him off, confronting strangers who stand too close to him in checkout lines, and shifting into “attack mode” when approached from behind by others. He springs into this aggressive mode automatically, without a thought or consideration of the circumstances. Although he keeps a handgun in the console of his car for self-protection, Mr. Reynolds has no intention of harming others. He is always remorseful after a threatening incident and worries that he might inadvertently hurt someone. Most recently, while drifting off to sleep on his physician’s examination table, a nurse touched his foot, and he leapt up and began cursing in a threatening manner. He felt as if he were back on guard duty, when he was accidentally dozing, and an incoming mortar round stunned him into action. His reaction scared both the nurse and himself.

Mr. Reynolds’s symptoms apparently began soon after he left Vietnam, where he served as a field radio operator. He never sought help for his symptoms, apparently because of his independent and self-reliant nature. After retirement as a self-employed electrician, he spent almost all of his time at home. During these past few years, his wife and adult children became more aware of his various symptoms, including how they were putting a severe strain on his family relationships and overall happiness.

Mr. Reynolds was raised in a loving family that struggled financially as Midwestern farmers. At age 20, Mr. Reynolds was drafted into the U.S. Army and deployed to Vietnam. He described himself as having been upbeat and happy prior to his army induction. He said he enjoyed basic training and his first few weeks in Vietnam, until one of his comrades got killed. At that point, all he cared about was getting home alive, even if it meant killing others. His personality changed from that of a happy-go-lucky farm boy to a terrified, overprotective soldier. Upon returning to civilian life, he managed to get a graduate business degree, but he became a self-employed electrician because of his need to stay isolated in his work. In his retirement, he hoped to volunteer, garden, and get some “peace and quiet.” It turned out, however, that his retirement was much like the rest of his adult life: although he could occasionally settle into one of his hobbies, most of his days were filled with tension, guilt, and arguments.

Despite having used alcohol and marijuana during his early adulthood, he had not consumed excessive alcohol for several decades or used marijuana since the age of 30. He had no legal history.

On examination, Mr. Reynolds was a well-groomed man who appeared anxious and somewhat guarded. He was coherent and articulate. His speech was at a normal rate, but the pace accelerated when he discussed disturbing content. He denied depression but was anxious. His affect was somewhat constricted but appropriate to content. His thought process was coherent and linear. He denied all suicidal and homicidal ideation. He had no psychotic symptoms, delusions, or hallucinations. He had very good insight. He was well oriented and seemed to have above-average intelligence.",Posttraumatic stress disorder,dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Examining insomnia codes**

I'm trying to figure out if insomnia disorder should be coded as F51.01 or G47.00 and I realize that insomnia disorders indeed fall under the G codes in ICD-10, while DSM-5 has it listed as 780.52. The guidelines mention not including non-psychiatric diagnoses that don't use F-codes, so that complicates things. However, nightmare disorder does have an F-code (F51.5) in ICD-10, which suggests that while some sleep disorders could be included, insomnia doesn't fit.

**Clarifying insomnia and related disorders**

I'm looking into how ICD-10-CM uses F51.01 for insomnia associated with mental disorders, while DSM-5 lists insomnia as 780.52 (G47.00). Nightmare Disorder is coded as F51.5 in DSM-5, but it's related to PTSD, which complicates whether to include it. The criteria for Nightmare Disorder suggest it's trauma-related, so it can't be included. I'm also considering comorbidities but wondering if ""Agoraphobia"" fits; though the individual still goes out, there's a sense of avoidance present. It seems tricky.

**Exploring trauma-related disorders**

I'm considering whether to include ""Unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder"" if the criteria for PTSD aren't fully met, though it seems he does meet them. I ponder options like ""Acute stress disorder"" and ""Dissociative disorder,"" where he might have had a flashback. While some disorders like ""Depersonalization"" and ""Reactive attachment disorder"" don't seem to apply, I’m trying to make sure I list five plausible diagnoses. I think it's important not to fabricate, but maybe including ""Other specified"" or ""Unspecified"" categories could reflect the uncertainty effectively.

**Considering potential diagnoses**

I'm exploring possible diagnoses, like ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" or ""Intermittent explosive disorder."" I think ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" could fit due to his feelings of guilt and sadness, even though he denies being depressed. There might be persistent depressive symptoms, but I'm not sure it's enough. I wonder if ""Persistent depressive disorder"" could apply, although he denies depression. There's potential for ""Adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct,"" but I don't think it fits. The idea of ""Unspecified personality disorder"" intrigues me, especially since his personality seems influenced by trauma, not something long-standing.

**Determining diagnoses**

I'm evaluating various potential diagnoses based on the symptoms. While personality disorders generally require stability from early adulthood, his trauma-related changes suggest it's more about PTSD than a personality disorder. I consider ""Intermittent explosive disorder"" and ""Generalized anxiety disorder,"" but they must be assessed against the PTSD diagnosis. My final list of top five likely diagnoses should include: PTSD (F43.10), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1), Intermittent Explosive Disorder (F63.81), Unspecified Depressive Disorder (F32.A), and possibly Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9) to reflect his anxious state.

**Evaluating Possible Diagnoses**

I need to provide a list of diagnoses, starting with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) as primary. While Intermittent Explosive Disorder is a possibility, it might overlap with PTSD symptoms. Generalized Anxiety Disorder could also fit, given his anxiety, but it often aligns with PTSD too. I’m considering other diagnoses like Unspecified Depressive Disorder due to his guilt and Alcohol Use Disorder in sustained remission, although I'm cautious about this. My final list will be PTSD (F43.10), Intermittent Explosive Disorder (F63.81), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1), Unspecified Depressive Disorder (F32.A), and Alcohol Use Disorder (F10.21).

**Exploring Possible Diagnoses**

I'm evaluating various diagnoses for this case. PTSD is the most apparent choice. I might also consider Unspecified Anxiety Disorder, though it overlaps with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). As for depressive disorders, either Other Specified or Unspecified could fit, but he denies being depressed despite exhibiting guilt. Paranoid Personality Disorder could be a differential, but it's likely trauma-related. After weighing everything, I think my top diagnoses should be: PTSD (F43.10), Intermittent Explosive Disorder (F63.81), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1), and Unspecified Depressive Disorder (F32.A).

**Evaluating Diagnostic Options**

I'm considering the required symptoms for various conditions. For Major Depressive Disorder, we need five symptoms for two weeks, which doesn't seem to fit here, but ""Other Specified Depressive Disorder"" might work since some symptoms are present. Anxiety disorders could fit as well, with ""Unspecified Anxiety Disorder"" being a possibility. However, the focus lands on PTSD, which seems clear. My final top diagnoses might include PTSD (F43.10), Other Specified Anxiety Disorder (F41.8), Intermittent Explosive Disorder (F63.81), Unspecified Depressive Disorder (F32.A), and Paranoid Personality Disorder (F60.0).

**Choosing Key Diagnoses**

I'm evaluating which diagnoses to include. PTSD feels like the primary diagnosis, followed by Intermittent Explosive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder or Unspecified Anxiety Disorder. I'm also considering Unspecified Depressive Disorder. However, including Alcohol or Cannabis Use Disorders seems uncertain given his history. He hasn't had excessive use for decades; this suggests he doesn't meet the criteria for current disorders. The list I might finalize could include PTSD (F43.10), Intermittent Explosive Disorder (F63.81), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1), and Unspecified Depressive Disorder (F32.A).

**Finalizing Diagnosis Options**

I'm determining the best diagnoses. I think we should start with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD, F43.12), then consider Intermittent Explosive Disorder (F63.81) and Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9) or Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1). Unspecified Depressive Disorder (F32.A) seems relevant, and I'm also considering an Unspecified Personality Disorder (F60.9). Each diagnosis must have some support. However, for anxiety, GAD may not fit perfectly, so I might lean towards Unspecified Anxiety Disorder instead to accurately reflect his symptoms.

**Selecting Diagnostic Options**

I’m considering whether to include ""Other specified personality disorder"" or ""Unspecified"" but suspect we may not have sufficient evidence for a personality disorder. It could be helpful to assess ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder,"" yet he meets full criteria for PTSD. I'm leaning towards listing ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" and possibly ""Generalized anxiety disorder"" among the top five diagnoses. Final thoughts include using Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (chronic, F43.12), Intermittent Explosive Disorder (F63.81), and Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9), among others.

**Finalizing Diagnostic Options**

I’m focusing on the top five diagnoses. Initially, I considered ""Other specified sleep-wake disorder,"" but it seems redundant since he has PTSD, which accounts for his nightmares. It looks like the best choices will be PTSD (chronic, F43.12), Intermittent Explosive Disorder (F63.81), and Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9). I debated including Paranoid Personality Disorder but it feels less fitting due to his insight. Instead, I might go with Unspecified Depressive Disorder (F32.A) as part of the secondary diagnoses.

**Determining Final Diagnoses**

I'm trying to finalize a list of diagnoses, starting with the top five. I've settled on ""Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), chronic"" (F43.12) and ""Intermittent Explosive Disorder"" (F63.81). 

I’m also considering ""Anxiety disorder, unspecified"" (F41.9) and ""Depressive disorder, unspecified"" (F32.A). For the fifth, I’m debating between ""Paranoid personality disorder"" and ""Personality disorder, unspecified,"" but neither feels ideal. I want to ensure I’m providing the most supported and relevant options while adhering to guidelines. Let's see how this all fits together!

**Finalizing Diagnoses Consideration**

I'm refining my list of diagnoses, focusing on codes like ""Depressive disorder, unspecified"" (F32.A) and its alternatives. There's a concern that some systems may not accept F32.A, so I might consider using F32.9, which implies major depression, but that could misrepresent his symptoms. I've determined that ""Other specified depressive disorder"" (F32.8) could be a safer choice since he exhibits some depressive symptoms without meeting the full criteria for major depressive disorder.

I'm also thinking about anxiety disorders and how to accurately classify them while ensuring the codes I choose align with DSM-5-TR updates. There's a lot to weigh in here!

**Finalizing Differential Diagnoses**

I'm refining my list of potential diagnoses based on the symptoms described. For the primary diagnosis, I'm considering “Post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic” (F43.12). For the secondary diagnoses, I have a few options. There’s “Intermittent explosive disorder” (F63.81), and for anxiety, I'm leaning toward “Anxiety disorder, unspecified” (F41.9) since generalized anxiety might not quite fit due to his hypervigilance. 

For depressive symptoms, ""Other specified depressive disorder"" (F32.8) seems appropriate, and I’m also contemplating ""Paranoid personality disorder"" (F60.0), but I might leave that out because it could be misleading.

**Selecting Diagnoses and F-Codes**

I'm considering different options for the fifth diagnosis and thinking about ""Avoidant personality disorder"" (F60.6) or possibly ""Schizoid personality disorder"" (F60.1), but those don't fit well. Maybe ""Prolonged grief disorder"" could work since he feels guilt and sadness, but doesn't quite yearn for loss. 

I've confirmed a top five list:  
1. Post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic - F43.12  
2. Intermittent explosive disorder - F63.81  
3. Generalized anxiety disorder - F41.1  
4. Depressive disorder, unspecified - F32.A  
5. Paranoid personality disorder - F60.0  

I'll finalize the codes based on accuracy and relevance!

**Finalizing Diagnosis List**

I'm finalizing the list of diagnoses based on the vignette. My primary diagnosis is Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (chronic) - F43.12. For the secondary diagnoses, I’m including:

128,"Franklin Sims was a 21-year-old single African American man who sought treatment at a university-affiliated community mental health care clinic because he felt “stressed out,” withdrawn from friends, and “worried about money.” He said he had been feeling depressed for 3 months, and he attributed the “nosedive” to the end of a 3-year romantic relationship shortly after he and his girlfriend had seriously discussed marriage.

Mr. Sims, the son of working-class parents, had supported himself financially since high school and was accustomed to feeling nervous about making ends meet. He was angered by his girlfriend’s decision to end the relationship, particularly her failure to understand his concerns about establishing financial stability. He increasingly ruminated about money, his grades, and his future.

Mr. Sims was a full-time undergraduate employed as a full-time midnight-shift warehouse worker. He was accustomed to this schedule, but he had increasingly found it difficult to concentrate in class after staying awake all night at the warehouse. When he had a day off, his sleep and energy were fine, and he still enjoyed hanging out with his friends. His appetite was unchanged, and his physical health was good. His grades had recently declined, however, and he had become increasingly discouraged about money and about being his family’s first college student. His parents did not understand why he had decided to attend an out-of-state university, and he was increasingly dissatisfied with life on the predominantly white college campus after some recent experiences of racial discrimination. He had not previously sought any type of mental health care services, but a supportive cousin suggested that he see a therapist after he had told her that he sometimes just felt like giving up.

Mr. Sims was an only child—a self-described “good student and popular kid.” High school was complicated by his parents’ periodic unemployment, financial strains, and related marital difficulties.

He started drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana in ninth grade, but neither had ever caused him difficulty. At the time of the evaluation, he said he occasionally had a beer or marijuana cigarette at parties, but that he didn’t have the time, money, or inclination to get intoxicated.

On examination, Mr. Sims was punctual, cooperative, pleasant, attentive, appropriately dressed, and well groomed. He spoke coherently. He appeared generally worried and constricted, but he smiled appropriately several times during the interview. He said he felt bad about his declining grades, but he denied feeling guilty or worthless. He had a quiet, dry sense of humor. He denied current suicidality, homicidality, and psychosis. He was cognitively intact, and his insight and judgment were considered good.","Adjustment disorder with depressed mood, acute stressor",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Diagnosing mood and anxiety disorders**

I'm considering various symptoms: depressed mood, diminished interest, and decreased concentration are present, but other key symptoms like psychomotor issues and fatigue aren't. This seems not enough for a major diagnosis, so adjustment disorder fits best. For the top 5 diagnoses, I might include Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood as primary, and possibly secondary options like unspecified anxiety disorders or specified depressive disorders. However, I realize some terms don’t align with coding requirements. It's a tricky analysis!

**Evaluating potential diagnoses**

I'm considering various diagnoses like ""Cannabis use disorder"" and ""Alcohol use disorder,"" but the user doesn't meet criteria. There's also ""Acculturation difficulty,"" which doesn’t align with the coding needed. I’m thinking about ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder,"" but that overlaps with adjustment. ""Major depressive disorder"" could be a differential, and I might include ""Generalized anxiety disorder,"" even though the duration requirement isn't met. I need to focus on the top five DSM diagnoses but also consider ""Adjustment disorder with depressed mood"" as a strong candidate. It's complex!

**Considering diagnostic options**

I’m contemplating various diagnoses, such as ""Unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder,"" but that doesn't seem fitting. There's also ""Other specified stressor-related disorder,"" or perhaps ""Relationship distress with spouse,"" but that's not coded as F. Maybe I need to consider including mild substance use disorders, but that feels off. Now, ""Cannabis use disorder, mild"" could be a possibility, but only if criteria are met, which they aren’t. It seems I need to find more viable F-coded diagnoses without fabricating any. It's quite a puzzle!

**Determining top diagnoses**

I'm considering whether ""Other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder"" fits due to rumination, but it might not be the best label. ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety"" seems possible, especially since there are depressive components too, so I think mixed is better. I’m also looking at options like ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" or ""Other specified depressive disorder."" I need to provide the top five most likely diagnoses, ensuring they're plausible and aligned with the instructions, yet I’m thinking that prioritizing differentials might help clarify things. It’s quite a balancing act!

**Structuring diagnostic options**

I need to carefully analyze the instructions that ask for a structured list of DSM-5-TR diagnoses, focusing on the top five likely diagnoses, complete with corresponding F-codes. I'm considering options like ""Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood"" as the primary diagnosis. It's tricky because I want to avoid overdiagnosing, especially around unspecified disorders. I must ensure that all five have plausible F-codes and reflect potential diagnoses without fabricating details. This requires a thoughtful approach!

**Identifying potential diagnoses**

I need to consider a range of diagnoses while avoiding overdiagnosing. I'm looking into options like ""Other specified depressive disorder"" and ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" as possible secondary choices. With anxiety, ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" and ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" are on the table too. It's crucial to ensure I provide the right ICD-10 codes alongside their corresponding diagnoses. Ultimately, I want to create a top 5 list that includes plausible primary and secondary options while respecting the guidelines provided.

I'm considering various diagnoses, such as ""Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood"" and ""Generalized anxiety disorder."" I'm also exploring options like ""Other specified depressive disorder"" but questioning their relevance. I need to ensure I comply with ICD-10 codes while also considering the possibility of overlapping symptoms. It's tricky because they want a structured top 5 list of diagnoses, but I want to keep it accurate without fabricating details. Ultimately, I plan to focus on the most plausible conditions while presenting them clearly.

I'm tasked with listing the most plausible diagnoses based on specific codes without going into clinical reasoning. I have to choose five structured diagnoses that make sense for the case, focusing on primary and secondary options.

I plan to include ""Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood"" as my primary diagnosis. For secondary diagnoses, I will consider ""Generalized anxiety disorder,"" ""Major depressive disorder, single episode, mild,"" ""Other specified depressive disorder,"" and ""Unspecified depressive disorder."" It’s a bit of a juggling act to fit everything clearly!

I'm focusing on creating a structured list of diagnoses based on the information provided. I want to be careful about using F-codes correctly and ensuring each diagnosis fits within the DSM-5-TR framework.

I'll include ""Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood"" as my primary diagnosis. The secondary diagnoses will be ""Generalized anxiety disorder,"" ""Other specified depressive disorder,"" ""Major depressive disorder, single episode, mild,"" and ""Other specified anxiety disorder."" I'm considering the plausibility of each diagnosis and ensuring they properly reflect the symptoms described in the vignette. This requires balancing the likelihood of each condition.

I'm focusing on crafting a structured list of diagnoses based on the information available. I realize ""Other specified depressive disorder"" is plausible since he has a depressed mood for three months, exceeding the two weeks needed for a diagnosis.

For the anxiety aspect, ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" may fit better than generalized anxiety disorder due to the symptom duration. After careful consideration, my final list is:

129,"The psychiatric consultation-liaison service at a large hospital was asked to “rule out depression” in Gabriela Trentino, a 65-year-old woman with recurrent lung cancer, after she was noted to display sad affect and tearfulness on morning rounds.

Ms. Trentino was a widowed Italian American homemaker with two grown sons. She had just been admitted to the medical service for shortness of breath. She was subsequently found to have a unilateral pleural effusion. Ms. Trentino had already been through several rounds of chemotherapy over the prior few months. At the time of the consultation, she was awaiting the results of thoracentesis to assess for pulmonary metastases.

Interviewed separately, Ms. Trentino and her two sons agreed that until this hospitalization, she had never previously been especially depressed or anxious but had instead been the family’s “rock.” She had never seen a therapist, taken psychiatric medication, or used alcohol, opiates, or illicit drugs. Her family history was notable for a father who drank to excess, which she described as the reason she had never tasted alcohol.

On examination, the patient was a well-groomed woman sitting in bed with an oxygen nasal cannula in place, wringing her hands and dabbing at her eyes with a wet tissue. She was cooperative and coherent. She was visibly dysphoric, with a constricted, worried affect. She reported being extremely worried about the pending thoracentesis study. She knew that metastases could mean “a death sentence” and said, “I want to be alive for my son’s marriage this year.” She added tearfully, “I’ve been through so much with the illness already.  . . . When is it going to stop?”

Ms. Trentino endorsed poor sleep and impaired concentration since her admission to the hospital 5 days earlier. She had been eating less than usual. She said she was “too sad and worried” to do her usual daily crossword. She denied confusion and psychotic symptoms. She appeared cognitively intact, and her Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 29 out of 30, with 1 lost point for incorrect recall of an object after 5 minutes. She adamantly denied suicidal ideation, again speaking of her love for her two children.

Ms. Trentino’s vital signs were notable for an oxygen saturation of 94% on room air (corrected to 99% on nasal cannula), and her chest X ray showed a large left-sided pleural effusion. Neurological examination was unremarkable. Her basic lab results were otherwise within normal limits. Collateral information from nursing staff indicated that she rang her call bell frequently throughout the day to ask about medication and test details.

Discussion with the patient’s family members revealed appropriate concern about their mother’s health, as well as frustration over her psychological state. As one of the sons told the psychiatric consultant, “We understand this is a stressful time for Mom, but all she does in the hospital is cry all day and keep on asking us the same questions over and over again. She’s usually the pillar of the family, and now she’s needy and pessimistic. Can you do something?”",Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood,dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Evaluating potential diagnoses**

I need to create a list of possible diagnoses based on the case details, focusing on the top five most likely ones. The symptoms began after a hospitalization and include tearfulness, sadness, anxiety, and poor sleep. The user expresses fears about her health and future. While her cognitive abilities test intact, her family notices a personality change. This could indicate either an acute stress reaction or stress disorder, especially given her serious illness. I'm curious about what blends of factors to consider!

**Assessing acute stress diagnosis**

I'm analyzing whether a metastatic cancer diagnosis meets the DSM-5 criterion A for acute stress disorder. While it's a life-threatening situation, it doesn't qualify as a traumatic event unless it's sudden and catastrophic. So, it seems that cancer itself doesn’t fit as criterion A. I also need to explore ""Adjustment disorder"" and other possibilities like ""Depressive or Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition"" since lung cancer's impact could affect mood. Still, I find no clear evidence of brain involvement or abnormalities, though there's a chance it might be substance-induced from chemotherapy.

**Exploring potential mood disorders**

I'm considering various potential diagnoses for the user. There's no clear indication of medications causing issues, but I'm wondering about hypoactive delirium from her recent hospitalization or hypoxia. Despite her oxygen saturation being corrected, she doesn't appear confused. The repetitive questions might hint at short-term memory impairment, but her MOCA score suggests cognitive function is mostly intact. 

I’m also looking at mood-related disorders, recognizing that ""Generalized anxiety disorder"" and ""Illness anxiety disorder"" aren’t fitting. ""Major depressive disorder"" is a possibility, though the duration isn't aligned. ""Adjustment disorder"" with anxious mood seems appropriate too, considering her emotional state. I'm even thinking about ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" or ""Other specified depressive disorder.""

**Clarifying adjustment diagnosis**

I’m analyzing the situation regarding adjustment disorder and its criteria. The presence of a stressor points to adjustment, but the DSM-5 indicates that a diagnosis isn't appropriate if another disorder's criteria are met. If her symptoms indicate Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), then MDD should be diagnosed. However, she doesn't fully meet MDD criteria, though she might align with ""Other Specified Depressive Disorder."" This disorder counts as a mental disorder and can supersede adjustment disorder if it leads to significant distress without meeting full criteria. This is a bit tricky!

**Determining appropriate diagnoses**

So, I'm evaluating adjustment disorder versus other depressive disorders. The presence of a stressor allows for an adjustment disorder diagnosis, yet it's tricky due to overlapping criteria with other disorders. I’ll check the DSM-5-TR criteria for adjustment disorders: symptoms must develop in response to stressors, be clinically significant, and not fit another mental disorder. This patient displays emotional distress and functional impairment but distinguishing normal anxiety from a disorder is essential. 

Given her variety of symptoms—tearfulness, sadness, and anxiety—I'm inclined towards ""Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood."" I also have to ensure I pick the correct ICD-10 F codes for my proposed diagnoses, such as adjusting the severity for Major Depressive Disorder. This situation is definitely nuanced!

**Consolidating potential diagnoses**

I'm narrowing down potential diagnoses, starting with adjustment disorder as the primary. I see that ""Other Specified Depressive Disorder"" can be a secondary option given the symptoms and short duration. It's important to evaluate whether her impairment is significant, as she struggles to engage in tasks like her crossword puzzle. I must be cautious about including diagnoses like ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder,"" especially given the immediate context.

I think the most relevant potential diagnoses would be:  
1. Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood (F43.23).  
2. Other Specified Depressive Disorder (F32.8).  
3. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder (F41.8).  
4. Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Mild (F32.0).  
5. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1).  

I'm considering the clinical relevance of each and attempting to align them appropriately without redundancy.

**Clarifying potential diagnoses**

I'm leaning towards using ""Other Specified Depressive Disorder, Short-Duration Depressive Episode"" since we have enough information. However, there's an identifiable stressor that might point to an adjustment disorder. If symptoms are directly related to the stressor and don’t meet criteria for another disorder, adjustment disorder could be appropriate, but it complicates things since we also have anxiety.

So, for the top five diagnoses, I would propose:  
1. Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood (F43.23).  
2. Other Specified Depressive Disorder (F32.8).  
3. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder (F41.8).  
4. Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Mild (F32.0).  
5. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1).  

I’ll focus on these plausible differentials while keeping clarity in mind.

**Assessing potential diagnoses**

I need to evaluate how her anxiety might interfere with medical care, like frequently calling for assistance. However, using F54 suggests psychological factors affecting a medical condition, which doesn’t seem to apply here.

I’m considering several diagnoses, including “Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood” and “Other Specified Depressive Disorder.” The patient shows prominent anxiety and symptoms that imply a mix. Given the timeline and her current distress, I’d prioritize these as the most likely:

1. Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood - F43.23  
2. Other Specified Depressive Disorder - F32.8  
3. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder - F41.8  
4. Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Mild - F32.0  
5. Generalized Anxiety Disorder - F41.1  

I’ll continue refining this based on her symptoms.

**Organizing potential diagnoses**

I'm considering several diagnoses here. The top possibilities are:

1. Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood - F43.23  
2. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder (Short-Duration Generalized Anxiety) - F41.8  
3. Other Specified Depressive Disorder (Short-Duration Depressive Episode) - F32.8  
4. Generalized Anxiety Disorder - F41.1  
5. Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Mild - F32.0  

While symptoms suggest a mix, anxiety is prominent. Also, her condition could indicate normal reactions to distress. Though the patient is tearful and worried, she remains hopeful and cognitively intact.

**Listing possible diagnoses**

I'm focusing on the top 5 diagnoses along with their ICD-10 F-codes. Here’s what I’m going with:  

1. Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood - F43.23  
2. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder - F41.8  
3. Other Specified Depressive Disorder - F32.8  
4. Generalized Anxiety Disorder - F41.1  
5. Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Mild - F32.0  

These choices reflect the patient's symptoms and context. Each one corresponds to a recognized DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnosis.

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

For the top 5 likely diagnoses, I’m focusing on relevant options without exhaustiveness. Here's the list I'll provide:

1. Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood - F43.23  
2. Other Specified Anxiety Disorders - F41.8  
3. Other Specified Depressive Disorder - F32.8  
4. Generalized Anxiety Disorder - F41.1  
5. Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Mild - F32.0  

I've double-checked the ICD-10 F-codes to ensure they're accurate, so this seems to cover everything needed!","1. Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood - F43.23

130,"Hannah, a 16-year-old white girl with no past psychiatric history, was brought to the hospital emergency department following an overdose of unknown amounts of sedating medications. Upon arrival, Hannah had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8, indicating severe compromise. She was intubated and admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. After stabilization over several days, she was admitted to an inpatient psychiatric unit. Current regulatory practice mandates suicide screening for all patients; in this case, Hannah screened positive for suicidal ideation, plan, and attempt on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS).

While Hannah was intubated, her parents and her best friend agreed that she appeared to have been in her usual good mood until the evening of the overdose. The best friend reported that a different friend had texted Hannah that she had seen Hannah’s boyfriend kissing another girl. Within a couple of hours of reading that text, Hannah was found by her parents, confused and barely arousable. On her desk was a note: “I just want to sleep forever.” The parents immediately called an ambulance.

Psychiatric history was notable for an absence of depression, suicidal ideation, self-injurious behaviors, mania, or psychosis. She had no previous psychiatric contacts, hospitalizations, or psychotherapy. According to her parents and her best friend, Hannah never used cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, or other illicit drugs. She had no legal history

Hannah lived with her parents and two younger sisters. Her academic performance as an eleventh grader at a local public school was stellar. She reported that she hoped to be a physician or attorney. Her best friend said she had been cheerful earlier in the day. Family psychiatric history was notable for her mother having an anxiety disorder for which she was prescribed clonazepam and alprazolam. As a late adolescent, the mother had also made two suicide attempts by medication overdose. Her father had chronic back pain from a sports injury, for which he took oxycodone. Extended family history was notable for a paternal uncle with an alcohol use disorder. No one in the extended family had committed suicide.

After she was extubated, Hannah said she felt fine, and that the suicidal feelings were completely gone. She also said that she had been doing well until the minute she read about her boyfriend kissing another girl. Hannah denied having any disturbances of mood, anxiety, sleep, appetite, energy, or concentration, either at the time of the evaluation or in the weeks leading up to the overdose. She denied somatic complaints, psychotic features, and any history of self-injury, such as cutting. She denied any history of trauma or substance use. She recalled that the thought to die came “out of the blue,” and that she immediately wrote the suicide note and gathered medications from her parents’ medicine cabinet. In retrospect, she was horrified by the overdose and grateful that she was alive.

Hannah continued to deny depression and suicidality throughout her hospitalization. She was discharged to outpatient care within the hospital clinic. No psychotropic medication was prescribed. She was seen weekly for cognitive-behavioral therapy that focused on coping skills when angry or disappointed. After 6 months, Hannah was noted to be doing well and to have been consistently free of suicidal ideation, intent, or behavior. At that point, Hannah, her parents, and the psychologist agreed to end the treatment, with the understanding that she would restart treatment should she experience any trouble coping.","1. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood
2. Suicidal behavior disorder",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Evaluating diagnosis categorization**

I need to make sure our diagnosis list accurately reflects the nuances, prioritizing adjustment disorder as primary and considering others as secondary. It seems that there are several vignettes mentioning things like ""Adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct"" and others that might fit, like ""Suicidal behavior disorder."" However, it's crucial to note that ""Suicidal behavior disorder"" is still under study. I have to ensure we provide the top five diagnoses along with their F codes accurately.

**Finalizing diagnostic list**

I’m compiling a list of possible diagnoses, starting with Major depressive disorder - ICD-10 F32.9, and an unspecified anxiety disorder - ICD-10 F41.9. I’m wondering about including ""Other specified personality disorder"" - ICD-10 F60.89 because the patient shows no personality pathology, though borderline personality disorder could be a differential option. It feels safer to keep F60.89, especially since diagnosing a personality disorder at 16 can be tricky. I'll ensure this list reflects top possibilities while maybe including plausible secondaries.

**Confirming diagnostic codes**

I should confirm that ""Other specified personality disorder"" - F60.89 is a legitimate DSM-5 diagnosis, and it is! Now, I’m considering other options like ""Other specified impulse-control disorder"" - F63.89, but it may not fit. I need four secondary diagnoses, which can be less likely, so let's focus on those. The ICD-10 code F19.929 seems like a suitable choice for substance intoxication, although it’s not perfectly aligned. I also need to consider benzodiazepines and could look at code F13.929 for that situation.

**Clarifying substance intoxication diagnoses**

I’m thinking about the ICD codes for substance intoxication. F19.929 seems too broad without specifics, while F13.929 for sedation seems more fitting since the mother had benzodiazepines. However, the vignette mentions an ""overdose of unknown amounts of sedating medications,"" which could encompass multiple substances from the parents’ cabinet, like clonazepam, alprazolam, and oxycodone. Even if multiple substances are involved, the DSM doesn’t separate those categories. It makes sense to go with F13.929 as the most plausible option based on sedation and available medications, but I can't make assumptions.

**Finalizing diagnosis listing**

I want to finalize the top five diagnoses and their corresponding codes. For the primary diagnosis, I'm choosing ""Adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct"" - F43.25. As for secondary diagnoses, I'm considering ""Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication, uncomplicated"" - F13.929; ""Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified"" - F32.9; ""Other specified personality disorder"" - F60.89; and ""Anxiety disorder, unspecified"" - F41.9. I’ll ensure all these codes are accurate and relevant to the case.

**Producing final diagnostic list**

I need to finalize the list of diagnoses. I’ve decided to go with ""Adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct"" - F43.25 as the primary diagnosis. For the secondary diagnoses, ""Anxiety disorder, unspecified"" - F41.9 is also relevant. It's important to follow the instruction not to include any non-psychiatric diagnoses that don't utilize F-codes, so those will be excluded. I'll deliver this final answer now, ensuring all codes are appropriate.","1. Adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct - ICD-10 F43.25

131,"Isaac Ulysse, a 29-year-old surgery resident at a large urban hospital, was referred to his employee assistance program because of “burnout.” Dr. Ulysse’s supervisors had become concerned about his appearing increasingly distracted and sad. After performing very well at their medical school and during the first 2 years of surgery training, Dr. Ulysse was now manifesting some problems, with his most recent performance review being notable for uncharacteristic sloppiness and lateness. Dr. Ulysse had shrugged off two referrals, but after being told that he was being released from work until he got clearance from psychiatry, he agreed to an evaluation.

Dr. Ulysse stated that he was fine, “just a little burned out.” He’d always prided himself on having more energy than everyone else, but he’d started getting worn down during the COVID-19 pandemic. He said he was sleeping poorly, was always tired, and was having trouble concentrating. After about 20 minutes, he asked if he could leave, that he felt better already. The psychiatrist explained that she would need to meet with him at least a few times before she could allow him to go back to work.

Reminded that he wasn’t yet ready to go back to work, Dr. Ulysse appeared to slump in his seat. When the psychiatrist asked him to say more, he replied that he hated being this way, hated being weak.

He said he knew he had burnout. He’d read up on it, and he felt exhausted, cynical about his being a “cog in the medical-industrial complex,” and less able to finish his daily work. He thought he might also have a depressive disorder, given that he was sad just about every day and also felt tired, worthless, and unable to sleep and concentrate normally. He said this had been going on for 12 or 18 months, but he’d been “good at hiding things until recently.” Dr. Ulysse asked whether the psychiatrist could diagnose him with burnout, since he’d prefer not to get a label that is a “career killer, at least for a surgeon.” He said he would be completely adherent with an antidepressant medication if the psychiatrist would let him go back to work. When asked if he felt suicidal, he responded that he had always thought that was a ridiculous question: “If you’re really serious about suicide, why tell somebody who has 911 on speed dial? But no, I’m not going to kill myself.”

At this point, the psychiatrist asked for more background information. Dr. Ulysse was the only child born to a pharmacist and a French professor, who had left Haiti when he was born. He had grown up in a suburban area where he was often the only Black child in his grade. When asked if that was difficult for him, he looked skeptical. “Yeah,” he said, “I know all about microaggressions and structural racism, all that stuff, but my strategy was to always be smarter, funnier, nicer, and more athletic than everybody else. I always had a confident smile on my face, and now nothing makes me happy. My nickname at my fancy high school was Superman. I literally dated the homecoming queen, and nobody seemed to mind about the Black/white thing.” At that point, he laughed and added, “well, except for my Gran, my dad’s mother, who lived with us when I was growing up. She thought I was asking for trouble.”

After a few moments of silence, Dr. Ulysse began to quietly cry. When asked to say more, he explained that his parents worked “all the time” when he was young, so his grandmother lived with them and took care of him throughout his school years. She had died of COVID-19 about 18 months earlier. Since then, he described thinking about her “all the time” and having become increasingly preoccupied by his failure to convince her to get the COVID vaccine.

He said he knew it was ridiculous, but he had partially believed her when she had insisted that she was able to protect everyone in the family from the virus. “Did I mention my Gran was a Catholic witch, and a very good one?” Dr. Ulysse added that although he knew she was dead, part of him continued to expect her to walk through the door, and he looked up multiple times every day, expecting her to be there. He spent long hours reviewing his inability to convince her to get the vaccine as well as his decision not to visit her for months for fear of infecting her. He awoke with nightmares most nights. He didn’t remember the content of the dreams very well, but they tended to be about his grandmother disappearing and him being unable to help. He noted that he had become increasingly angry and bitter at colleagues, his parents, and his ex-girlfriend. Since she had moved out of their apartment 6 months earlier, he hadn’t spoken to her or seen any of his friends. His parents called frequently and have tried to “kidnap” him for a weekend with family, but they appear to have gotten frustrated that he was being so stubborn. He said that he was okay watching TV—where he focused on “pestilence and wars”—but he just felt too numb to talk to people. He also stated that he barely knew who he was anymore, and that his job as a surgery trainee had come to seem irrelevant if it meant that he couldn’t even help his family. Although he was definitely not going to kill himself, and he knew the whole idea was “stupid,” he did daydream almost every day about being dead so that he could see his grandmother again.","1. Major depressive disorder
2. Prolonged grief disorder",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Determining diagnoses with codes**

I'm looking at what the user wants: the top 5 most likely diagnoses. I'll include provisional diagnoses as well. There's a mention of DSM's specifier for ""with predominant depressive symptoms,"" which is useful for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), but not for Persistent Grief Disorder (PGD). I need to use ICD-10 F codes that correspond to each diagnosis since each has specific codes according to DSM-5-TR. I'll pay attention to detail here!

**Verifying diagnosis codes**

I'm going through the diagnosis codes to verify their accuracy. For instance, Prolonged Grief Disorder is F43.81, while Major Depressive Disorder has various codes based on severity, like F32.2 for severe without psychotic features, down to F32.9 for unspecified. I also noticed the codes for PTSD (F43.10) and various adjustment disorders with their respective codes. There are others like Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1) and OCD (F42) that I need to keep track of as well. It's crucial to ensure they're all correct!

**Clarifying diagnosis codes**

I'm going through a list of diagnosis codes again to ensure accuracy. For example, Avoidant Personality Disorder is F60.6, and Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder is F48.1. There's also an unspecified dissociative disorder (F44.9) and Dissociative Identity Disorder (F44.81). I noticed something about depressive disorders: there's ""Depression, unspecified"" (F32.A), but I can use F32.9 as well. 

Additionally, I need to clarify the codes for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) since F43.81 has changed. I’m just trying to make sure I don’t get confused!

**Verifying PTSD codes**

I’m trying to clarify the code for Prolonged Grief Disorder, which is listed as F43.81, but I'm mixing it up with PTSD. Let's check: in ICD-10-CM, F43.10 is for unspecified PTSD, while F43.11 and F43.12 denote acute and chronic PTSD, respectively. F43.81 might also be a variant of PTSD, but that’s confusing since it overlaps with other codes. 

I'm just working to nail down what each code actually represents to avoid any mistakes!

**Identifying top diagnoses**

I’m working on compiling a list of the top 5 likely diagnoses for a case involving grief and depression. I think we should consider Prolonged Grief Disorder as the primary diagnosis, which is central to the case, with Major Depressive Disorder as secondary. Other potential diagnoses might include Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder, Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, and maybe Generalized Anxiety Disorder. 

There's a lot to weigh, especially given the symptoms related to grief and anxiety, but I want to keep the list structured and plausible. It's important to reflect what's most likely!

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

I’m piecing together the top 5 likely diagnoses for the case based on the presented symptoms. I think Prolonged Grief Disorder should be the primary diagnosis, with Major Depressive Disorder as secondary. Other possibilities include Posttraumatic Stress Disorder or an Adjustment Disorder, and a Nightmare Disorder as well. 

There seems to be some ambiguity with symptoms like preoccupation with grief, but I'll make sure to organize them by likelihood. It's essential to clarify these overlaps and ensure everything fits together!

**Clarifying diagnosis selection**

I'm sorting through the appropriate diagnoses for the case. Initially, I'm considering Prolonged Grief Disorder as the primary diagnosis, followed by Major Depressive Disorder and potentially other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorders. 

While adjusting might be plausible, symptoms strongly lean toward PGD. I confirm PTSD is a possibility but may be better represented by an alternate coding. Nightmare disorder also fits based on evaluated symptoms. Let's finalize everything with accurate ICD-10 codes to ensure clarity!

**Refining diagnosis options**

I’m considering whether to include ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder"" to represent burnout, but technically, burnout isn't classified that way; it results from chronic occupational stress. 

I already have a list of diagnoses including Prolonged Grief Disorder as the primary diagnosis, followed by Major Depressive Disorder, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, and Nightmare Disorder. 

I need to confirm that each diagnosis is appropriate and accurately recommended. It seems that PGD and MDD are strong contenders, so I’ll focus on that—ensuring my choices reflect the symptoms presented.

**Evaluating mood and diagnosis**

The individual shows signs of low mood, anhedonia, low self-esteem, and passive suicidal thoughts; these factors indicate meaningful comorbidity. There's a possible connection to burnout and underlying Prolonged Grief Disorder following a COVID-related death.

I’m outlining five potential diagnoses, including Prolonged Grief Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, and Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder or Adjustment Disorder. I also need to consider PTSD and Nightmare Disorder.

Ultimately, I need to ensure that all chosen diagnoses reflect the symptoms and meet the required criteria accurately.

**Finalizing diagnoses list**

I'm working on finalizing the diagnoses according to the user's instructions. I need to include primary and secondary diagnoses, adhering to the DSM-5-TR criteria. My current list includes:

1. Prolonged grief disorder - F43.81  
2. Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe without psychotic features - F32.2  
3. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood - F43.21

132,"Judith Vaughan was a 29-year-old special education teacher who sought a psychiatric consultation because “I’m tired of always being sad and alone.”

The patient reported chronic, severe depression that had not responded to multiple trials of antidepressants and mood stabilizer augmentation. She reported greater benefit from psychotherapies based on cognitive-behavioral therapy and dialectical behavior therapy. Electroconvulsive therapy had been suggested, but she had refused. She had been hospitalized twice for suicidal ideation and severe self-cutting that required stitches.

Ms. Vaughan reported that previous therapists had focused on the likelihood of trauma, but she casually dismissed the possibility that she had ever been abused. It had been her younger sister who had reported “weird sexual touching” by their father when Ms. Vaughan was 13. There had never been a police investigation, but her father had apologized to the patient and her sister as part of a resultant church intervention and an inpatient treatment for alcoholism and “sex addiction.” She denied any feelings about these events and said, “He took care of the problem. I have no reason to be mad at him.”

Ms. Vaughan reported little memory for her life between the ages of about 7 and 13 years. Her siblings would joke about her inability to recall family holidays, school events, and vacation trips. She explained her amnesia by saying, “I don’t remember anything because nothing happened.”

She reported a “good” relationship with both parents. Her father remained “controlling” toward her mother and still had “anger issues,” but had been abstinent from alcohol for 16 years. On closer questioning, Ms. Vaughan reported that her self-injurious and suicidal behavior primarily occurred after visits to see her family or when her parents surprised her by visiting.

Ms. Vaughan described being “socially withdrawn” until high school, at which point she became academically successful and a member of numerous teams and clubs. She did well in college. She excelled at her job and was regarded as a gifted teacher of autistic children. She described several friendships of many years. She reported difficulty with intimacy with men, experiencing intense fear and disgust at any attempted sexual advances. Whenever she did get at all involved with a man, she felt intense shame and a sense of her own “badness,” although she felt worthless at other times as well. She tended to sleep poorly and often felt tired.

She denied use of alcohol or drugs. She added that even the smell of alcohol made her feel like throwing up.

On mental status examination, the patient was well groomed and cooperative. Her responses were coherent and goal directed, but often devoid of emotional content. She appeared sad and constricted. She described herself as “numb.” She denied hallucinations, confusion, and a current intention to kill herself. However, thoughts of suicide were “always around.”

More specific questions led Ms. Vaughan to deny that she had ongoing amnesia for daily life, particularly denying ever being told of behavior she could not recall, unexplained possessions, subjective time loss, fugue episodes, or inexplicable fluctuations in skills, habits, and/or knowledge. She denied a sense of subjective self-division, hallucinations, inner voices, or passive influence symptoms. She denied flashbacks or intrusive memories, but she did report recurrent nightmares of being chased by “a dangerous man” from whom she could not escape. She reported difficulty concentrating, although she was “hyperfocused” at work. She reported an intense startle reaction. She said that she often found herself silently counting and singing rather than let herself daydream. She added that she was very careful, checking multiple times every night to ensure that her doors were locked. When she got anxious, she found that rearranging her furniture helped her feel safer.","1. Dissociative amnesia
2. Major depressive disorder, chronic, with suicidal ideation
3. Posttraumatic stress disorder",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Deciding on diagnoses**

I'm considering which diagnoses to include, particularly looking at ""Persistent depressive disorder"" as an alternative to Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). It's tricky since they might overlap, but I think I can list both. I want to focus on the top five DSM diagnoses I should include. My current list suggests:

1. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
2. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe
3. Dissociative amnesia
4. Obsessive-compulsive disorder
5. Persistent depressive disorder or Borderline personality disorder.

I need to determine which four secondary diagnoses to choose, weighing which might be most relevant.

**Evaluating personality disorders**

I'm thinking about the possibility of identity disturbance related to feelings of badness or shame, and looking at dissociation and friendships. While she has long-term friendships, her intimacy issues suggest she might not have Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) since she lacks symptoms like impulsivity or anger. Instead, Avoidant Personality Disorder seems more fitting with her feelings of inadequacy and social withdrawal. Yet, she does form friendships, indicating some social interaction. I'll also consider alternatives like Generalized Anxiety Disorder or Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder, but those don't seem to fully match either.

**Exploring potential diagnoses**

I'm considering various diagnoses, like ""Major Depressive Disorder with Anxious Distress,"" but it wasn’t specifically asked for. There’s also the idea of ""Unspecified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder"" for her compulsive checking behavior. It seems she uses counting and singing to avoid intrusive thoughts, suggesting some anxiety management strategies. Rearranging furniture when anxious might indicate a need for control over her environment, which could relate to PTSD as well. I’m contemplating ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder"" due to her chronic anxiety and sleep issues. However, excessive anxiety isn't clearly described, so ""Unspecified Anxiety Disorder"" or even ""Insomnia Disorder"" could work too.

**Considering possible diagnoses**

I'm analyzing her sleep issues, considering ""Nightmare Disorder"" since she experiences recurrent nightmares of being chased. That could connect to PTSD, but it’s tricky to establish comorbidity. I’m ruling out ""Alcohol Use Disorder"" since she denies it, as well as options like ""Reactive Attachment Disorder,"" ""Anorexia,"" and ""Depersonalization/Derealization."" So, my top five diagnoses might be PTSD, Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Dissociative Amnesia, OCD, and Persistent Depressive Disorder. However, including both MDD and Persistent Depressive Disorder feels redundant, and maybe I should think about adding Borderline Personality Disorder instead. I’ll re-evaluate based on the given clinical vignette.

**Determining top diagnoses**

I need to establish the top five most likely diagnoses along with their ICD-10 F-codes. This will probably include:

1. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) - F43.10
2. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, severe - F33.2
3. Dissociative Amnesia - F44.0
4. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder - F42
5. Borderline Personality Disorder - F60.3 

However, I’m debating whether to replace Borderline Personality Disorder with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, as the anxiety and suicidal thoughts may be more relevant. Another option could be Persistent Depressive Disorder since her chronic depression is mentioned, but I want to ensure my final choices reflect the most plausible options without redundancy.

**Finalizing diagnoses and codes**

2. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, severe without psychotic features - F33.2

133,"Ken Waldron, a 20-year-old college sophomore, was referred by his resident advisor (RA) to the school’s mental health care clinic after he appeared depressed in the weeks following a breakup with his girlfriend. Mr. Waldron did not attend the evaluation session, telling his RA that “everybody gets bummed after a breakup—I'll be fine.” When Mr. Waldron seemed “strange and out of it,” his RA made another appointment and then accompanied Ken to the meeting.

In that initial session, Mr. Waldron was hesitant but revealed that he had been crushed by the breakup. While he had previously been an excellent student, he’d quit doing homework and just looked out the window during class. He noticed that his grades had declined markedly, but “I don’t seem to care.” Although he said he felt lonely, he also admitted to steadily deleting incoming texts, so that he rarely communicated with his friends and family.

When asked to describe other symptoms of depression, Mr. Waldron replied that he didn’t have anything to say. He said that his mind felt blank, “as usual.” He added that he also felt increasingly detached from his physical body, going about his daily activities “like a robot.” He said he felt so disconnected that he often wondered if he were dead or living in a dream, or just had “no self.”

Mr. Waldron said that he’d been depressed for a few weeks after the breakup. He said he’d never been in love before and was shocked when Jill told him she needed “time apart.” For weeks afterward, he felt sad and a little desperate, but he’d continued to see friends and go to class; however, at some point, things began to change. He said he started feeling numb, unreal, and disconnected, but it was all a little fuzzy.

Mr. Waldron described a time-limited bout of extreme anxiety in tenth grade. At that time, panic attacks had begun and then escalated in severity and frequency over 2 months. During those attacks, he had felt very detached, as if everything around him was unreal. The symptoms sometimes lasted for several hours and were reminiscent of his current complaints. The onset appeared to coincide with his mother’s entry into a psychiatric hospital. When she was discharged, all of his symptoms cleared rapidly. He did not seek treatment at that time.

Mr. Waldron also described experiencing transient feelings of unreality in elementary school, just after his parents divorced and his father left young Jason and his mother, who had a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. His childhood was significant for pervasive loneliness and the sense that he was the only adult in the family. His mother was only marginally functional, with a few actively psychotic episodes. His father rarely visited but did provide enough money for them to continue to live in reasonable comfort. Jason often stayed with his grandparents on weekends, but in general, he and his mother lived a very isolated life. He did well in school and had a few close friends, but he largely kept to himself and rarely brought friends home. Jill would have been the first girlfriend to meet his mother.

Mr. Waldron denied using any drugs, in particular cannabis, hallucinogens, or ketamine, and his urine toxicology was negative. Although his home life featured emotional neglect by both parents and emotional abuse when his mother was actively psychotic, he denied physical or sexual abuse. He denied any psychiatric history of mania, psychosis, or other past psychiatric symptoms, except as described above. He also specifically denied amnesia, blackouts, multiple identities, hallucinations, paranoia, and other unusual thoughts or experiences.

Results of routine laboratory tests, a blood toxicology screen, and a physical examination were normal, as were a brain magnetic resonance imaging scan and an electroencephalogram. Consultations with an otorhinolaryngologist and a neurologist were noncontributory.",Depersonalization/derealization disorder,dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"I see the instructions clearly state that I shouldn't create any extra details or infer beyond what's been described. It seems crucial to focus only on the symptoms provided. I'll look for an appropriate interpretation based on the symptoms according to the DSM requirements. My challenge is to choose diagnoses that fit without overstepping into adding unmentioned symptoms or making assumptions. It's all about being precise and responsible!

I need to closely analyze the symptoms described. We're looking at a 20-year-old male college sophomore who appeared depressed after a breakup. Initially resistant to help, he later showed signs of apathy and social withdrawal, even deleting texts from friends. His academic performance has declined sharply, along with feelings of detachment and questioning his existence. He mentions feeling ""like a robot"" and having a blank mind. It's clear the breakup has affected him deeply, marking a significant emotional struggle.

I’m examining some complex experiences here. The individual has felt sad and desperate for weeks but managed to attend class and maintain friendships. At some point, this changed to feelings of numbness and disconnection, making the timeline fuzzy. Looking back, I see he had a prior bout of anxiety in tenth grade that coincided with his mother's psychiatric hospitalization, leading to panic attacks and feelings of unreality. It seems his childhood involved significant loneliness and complicated family dynamics, all contributing to his current struggles.

I'm examining a case where the individual had their first girlfriend meet their mother. They denied any illicit drug use, and tests came back negative for substances. There's a troubling history of emotional neglect and abuse from a psychotic mother, but they denied any physical or sexual abuse. After a negative medical workup, it appears they're suffering from symptoms of depersonalization and derealization. Their experiences align with the criteria for Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder, as they feel detached from reality but maintain some grasp on it.

I'm trying to assess the symptoms clearly. The individual shows significant academic decline and social withdrawal, indicating impairment. There's no evidence that these symptoms are linked to substances or physical conditions. Though depressive symptoms appeared after a breakup, the predominant symptoms are dissociative, which suggests a possible diagnosis of Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder (DDD). 

I’m considering whether to diagnose Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood too, but since he has DDD, and the symptoms don't strictly meet the criteria for Adjustment Disorder, it may not apply. I want to find the best fit!

I'm evaluating a case with symptoms suggesting possible diagnoses. There's a clear presence of apathy, social withdrawal, and reduced functioning, which could point to Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder (DDD). Despite denying psychotic symptoms and maintaining reality testing, the individual has thoughts about existence that might hint at nihilistic delusions. 

I’m weighing whether to include Adjustment Disorder or Other Specified Depressive Disorder based on the significant mood symptoms and impairment after a breakup. Still, if DDD is primary, that could explain the depressive reactions. Overall, I must articulate this complexity in my top five diagnoses, ensuring they reflect what I've gathered.

I'm working on a list of potential diagnoses based on the symptoms presented. It includes Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder, Panic Disorder, and Major Depressive Disorder, but I need to focus on the most likely options. Symptoms like apathy and social withdrawal lead me to prioritize DDD first. For the mood-related symptoms, I’m considering either Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood or Other Specified Depressive Disorder, likely the latter due to insufficient symptom criteria. I need to finalize the top five diagnoses with appropriate F-codes.

I’m trying to sort through the possible diagnoses. I wonder if his depressive symptoms could fit as adjustment disorder, but I don't want to duplicate other diagnoses. I need to come up with five plausible options. Panic disorder in remission might be included, along with other specified or unspecified anxiety disorders. But based on his symptoms, the primary diagnosis could be Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder. I’ll consider secondary diagnoses like Panic Disorder, Other Specified Depressive Disorder, and possibly an anxiety disorder. It’s quite a puzzle!

I'm considering the possibility of Schizoid Personality Disorder but factors like having few close friends and a girlfriend make it unlikely. Avoidant Personality Disorder seems off too. I also wonder about an Unspecified Personality Disorder due to emotional detachment. There's a challenge in finding five unique diagnoses, but I might include Panic Disorder, Other Specified Depressive Disorder, and Adjustment Disorder. Based on his symptoms, the primary diagnosis could be Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder along with four plausible secondary diagnoses. It's quite a balancing act!

I’m considering including ""Unspecified Dissociative Disorder"" as a possible diagnosis if his symptoms aren’t persistent enough for a clear classification, but he does have recurrent episodes. I’ll ensure the ICD-10 codes for each diagnosis are accurate. The main candidates include ""Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder,"" ""Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood,"" ""Other Specified Depressive Disorder,"" ""Panic Disorder,"" and ""Other Specified Anxiety Disorder."" I need to refine this and ensure the final selection truly reflects current symptoms and their context.

I'm considering the effects of the breakup as a significant stressor that's contributing to his dissociative symptoms and mood changes. I might include ""Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder"" due to childhood stress, but he lacks detailed trauma symptoms. My proposed top five diagnoses would be:

1. Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder - F48.1
2. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood - F43.21
3. Other Specified Depressive Disorder - F32.8
4. Panic Disorder - F41.0
5. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder - F41.9

Each suggests how his experiences are linked to his current presentation.

I'm considering various dissociative disorders for my top five diagnoses along with their ICD codes. The main options include:

1. Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder - F48.1
2. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood - F43.21
3. Other Specified Depressive Disorder - F32.8
4. Panic Disorder - F41.0
5. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder (panic attacks) - F41.8

I’m deliberating if some of these might be redundant or if I should include an alternative like ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety."" I want to present the most relevant and accurate diagnoses for this case.

I'm pondering whether a trauma- and stressor-related disorder is likely, considering early emotional neglect and abuse. However, DSM criteria A requires more severe experiences, so PTSD isn't applicable. ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder"" could work if symptoms cause distress but don't meet full criteria.

I am reviewing potential diagnoses. My final suggested list includes:

1. Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder - F48.1
2. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood - F43.21
3. Other Specified Depressive Disorder - F32.8
4. Panic Disorder - F41.0
5. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder - F41.8

This captures the main concerns while considering the complexities involved.

I'm considering the diagnoses for the case, and while ""Unspecified dissociative disorder"" could be included, it might feel redundant. I’m also thinking about whether to add ""Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum"" as it could be a risk, but the absence of psychotic symptoms makes that less likely. 

Overall, my aim is to create a structured list of the top five most likely diagnoses. So I’m focusing on these potential options:

1. Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder - F48.1  
2. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood - F43.21  
3. Other Specified Depressive Disorder - F32.8  
4. Panic Disorder - F41.0  
5. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder - F41.8  

This should align with the user's request!

I'm considering whether to include ""Unspecified dissociative disorder"" as a secondary diagnosis. Although it fits the criteria, I want to ensure I have enough evidence to support it. The primary possibility seems to be ""Depersonalization/derealization disorder."" 

For the secondary list, I could include ""Adjustment disorder with depressed mood,"" ""Other specified depressive disorder,"" ""Other specified anxiety disorder,"" and possibly ""Unspecified personality disorder."" It looks like I should focus on five solid diagnoses. So, my final list might be:

1. Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder - F48.1  
2. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood - F43.21  
3. Other Specified Depressive Disorder - F32.8  
4. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder - F41.8  
5. Unspecified Dissociative Disorder - F44.9  

This aligns with the user's request for a structured diagnosis!

I'm considering whether to include ""Unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder"" since it might capture his reactions to stress and early trauma. We need to evaluate the possibility of PTSD, but it seems the criteria aren't met. I think I should prioritize ""Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder"" as the primary diagnosis, with several secondary options like ""Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood"" and ""Other Specified Depressive Disorder."" 

I aim to provide a structured list with unique diagnoses covering dissociative, depressive, and anxiety conditions to present the most accurate picture.

I’m considering whether to include ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" as a separate diagnosis, but I also think about several other possibilities. It seems I could list ""Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder"" as well as ""Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood."" While these overlap with depressive symptoms following a stressor, they can be justified as part of the specific case. 

Ultimately, I’ll focus on listing five unique diagnoses:

1. Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder - F48.1. 
2. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood - F43.21. 
3. Other Specified Depressive Disorder - F32.8. 
4. Panic Disorder - F41.0. 
5. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder - F41.9. 

This should cover the primary and secondary diagnoses effectively.

134,"Lourdes Zayas, a 33-year-old Puerto Rican woman born in the United States, was brought to the emergency room (ER) after she became distraught and tried to swallow bleach.

The patient, who had no previous psychiatric history, had apparently been doing fine until the day before, when her fiancé was murdered in a drug-related incident in Puerto Rico. Her family reported that Ms. Zayas reacted initially with inordinate calm. Concerned, relatives discreetly followed her around in their small apartment for several hours. She did not speak but instead engaged in repetitive, unnecessary tasks such as folding and unfolding clothes.

That afternoon, standing at the washing machine, she had cried out, grabbed a bottle of bleach, and tried to drink from it. Her brother knocked it away. She fell to the ground, shaking, screaming, and crying. This episode lasted a few seconds, after which she “lay as if dead” for a few minutes. The family recalled no tonic-clonic movements, tongue biting, or loss of sphincter control. When the ambulance arrived, Ms. Zayas was crying softly, repeating the name of her fiancé, and was generally unresponsive to questions. After medical staff treated mild burns to her lips, she was triaged to the psychiatry department.

Over the next few hours, Ms. Zayas became more responsive. During a clinical interview done in Spanish, she reported being struck “numb” (insensible) by the news of her fiancé’s death and described a sense of being disconnected from her body, her emotions, and her surroundings. These symptoms were still present in the ER but diminished over several hours. She also described amnesia for what occurred from the moment when she cried out and her vision went “dark” (oscura), to when she “awoke” in the ER.

While being kept under observation for 24 hours, Ms. Zayas had two more episodes of sudden agitation, crying, and screaming, during which she attempted to scratch her face and to leave the room. Because she responded quickly to verbal intervention and reassuring physical contact, she was not given medications or placed in restraints, but was kept on one-to-one observation. Her laboratory test results were unremarkable, as were an electroencephalogram and a lumbar puncture.

On examination, she was crying softly, her mood was sad, and she said she did not remember making a suicide attempt. She was oriented to time, person, and place; had no psychotic symptoms; and denied current suicidal ideation.

Ms. Zayas was transferred to an inpatient psychiatric unit for evaluation. She initially had difficulty falling asleep and had sad, scary dreams about her fiancé. She denied recalling anything from the hours after she tried to swallow bleach. She made efforts to avoid thinking about her fiancé and was disturbed by intrusive recollections of their time together, but she never met DSM-5 criteria for acute stress disorder or major depressive disorder. Her symptoms had improved significantly after 1 week. She took no medications at the hospital and was discharged after 10 days with follow-up to outpatient care. She attended a single appointment 1 month later, at which point she and her family agreed that she was episodically sad about the death of her fiancé but essentially back to her normal self. At that point, she was lost to follow-up.",Other specified dissociative disorder (acute dissociative reactions to stressful events),dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Structuring psychiatric diagnoses**

I should include both diagnoses since they overlap, but the DSM might not allow both at the same time. It's important to provide a structured list of the top 5 DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses. They want the primary diagnosis along with four secondary ones, focusing on differential possibilities rather than comorbidity. In clinical vignettes, there’s usually one main diagnosis and then alternative plausible diagnoses, so I'll approach this task as a differential listing.

**Identifying possible diagnoses**

I’m considering several diagnoses here: Dissociative amnesia, conversion disorder, adjustment disorder, and possibly acute stress disorder, but it seems she never met the criteria for that. Since they specified she doesn’t fit the acute stress disorder criteria, I shouldn’t include it. Instead, I can consider ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder."" 

I also evaluated other options like major depressive disorder and panic disorder, but those seemed unlikely. Depersonalization/derealization disorder had symptoms lasting hours, so it’s less likely, but I might keep it as a differential.

**Selecting appropriate diagnoses**

I’m considering some possible diagnoses: I think I can include unspecified anxiety disorder and functional neurological symptom disorder. Dissociative amnesia, other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder, and adjustment disorder also seem valid options. 

I need one more, but I'm cautious about unspecified dissociative disorder and brief psychotic disorder. Posttraumatic stress disorder might not fit since her symptoms improved quickly. Acute stress disorder is out too. I did think about catatonia associated with another mental disorder; she had mutism and repetitive behaviors, which might meet the criteria since catatonia requires at least three symptoms.

**Refining potential diagnoses**

I'm considering whether catatonia associated with another mental disorder is an option, specifically F06.1, but since there's no medical cause, it's better to avoid it. Another possibility is ""brief dissociative stupor,"" linked to ICD F44.2, since she did ""lay as if dead"" for a few minutes, though not for long. 

I think we should list ""conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder)"" as a secondary diagnosis. I also need to include the cultural syndrome Ataque de nervios, possibly specifying ""Other specified dissociative disorder (ataque de nervios)."" The output should be structured as ""<Primary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code"" for clarity. However, I’m not sure about diagnosing ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder"" as persistent complex bereavement disorder.

**Determining diagnoses after trauma**

I’m reviewing potential diagnoses. She attempted to swallow bleach, which could indicate suicidal behavior, but she denies any recall. Episodes of agitation and distress seem like panic attacks but with aggression. For a primary diagnosis, I’m considering ""Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood"" or ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder.""

Given her immediate symptoms after a traumatic event, a strong candidate appears to be ""Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder (acute stress reaction)."" We’ll structure the list with appropriate F-codes while recognizing cultural concepts like ""ataque de nervios."" Both ""Other specified dissociative disorder"" and dissociative amnesia are worth weighing, though they cannot be both primary. I'll finalize my structured diagnosis accordingly.

**Determining primary and secondary diagnoses**

I’m considering whether to make ""Other Specified Dissociative Disorder"" primary, especially since it highlights dissociation influenced by cultural reactions. Given her prominent dissociation after trauma but not meeting criteria for PTSD, a dissociative disorder might fit better. 

For a structured differential diagnosis, I'm proposing:

1. Other Specified Dissociative Disorder (acute dissociative reaction) - F44.89
2. Dissociative Amnesia - F44.0
3. Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder - F43.8
4. Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Disturbance - F43.25
5. Conversion Disorder - F44.5

This list highlights plausible diagnoses based on her symptoms and context, including acute dissociation and suicidal behavior after trauma.

**Crafting the diagnosis list**

The focus here is on compiling a structured list of diagnoses based on her symptoms without any extra explanation. So, here’s the final output of the relevant diagnoses with their corresponding ICD-10 codes:

1. Other specified dissociative disorder (acute dissociative reaction to traumatic stressor) - F44.89  
2. Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder (subthreshold acute stress response) - F43.8  
3. Dissociative amnesia - F44.0  
4. Adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct - F43.25  
5. Functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder), with attacks or seizures - F44.5

**Analyzing potential diagnoses**

I'm considering marked distress that isn’t in line with the severity of the stressor, alongside significant impairment in social and occupational functioning. It's important to note that her symptoms don't fit other mental disorders and aren't a normal reaction to bereavement. While she shows signs of dissociative amnesia, the possibility of adjustment-like disorders emerges. There are several potential diagnoses to contemplate, including other specified dissociative disorder and functional neurological symptom disorder. Ultimately, I think dissociative amnesia should be the primary diagnosis due to the nature of her memory loss.

**Evaluating dissociative diagnoses**

I'm weighing the episodes of dissociation against different criteria. There’s evidence suggesting she exhibits symptoms of dissociative stupor or trance, given her decreased responsiveness and agitation. ""Other specified dissociative disorder"" seems suitable, particularly because her symptoms don’t meet the criteria for typical adjustment disorders.

However, I'm also considering dissociative amnesia, as she has localized memory gaps surrounding her traumatic event. Ultimately, dissociative amnesia feels like the most accurate diagnosis, especially considering her significant memory loss related to her suicide attempt.

**Considering diagnosis options**

I'm thinking about how cultural elements might influence the diagnosis here. The ""ataque de nervios"" episode suggests she could fit into the ""Other specified dissociative disorder"" category. In the DSM-5, ""ataque de nervios"" can include dissociation, anxiety, and episodic symptoms, which aligns with her experience. 

Given her significant memory loss surrounding the trauma, dissociative amnesia also seems like a strong candidate. The final diagnosis must capture both her dissociative reactions and cultural context, so I’m leaning toward ""Other specified dissociative disorder.""

**Analyzing diagnosis options**

I’m reflecting on the possible diagnoses for this case. The patient initially showed acute dissociative symptoms, with significant amnesia following a traumatic event. While she experienced some grief-related symptoms, they didn't fully meet the criteria for acute stress disorder. 

I’m leaning toward coding ""Other specified dissociative disorder"" as primary due to her cultural context and symptoms. For secondary options, I’ll include ""Dissociative amnesia"" and ""Other specified trauma-related disorder."" My final ranking looks coherent, ensuring all symptoms are appropriately captured within the diagnosis.

1. Other specified dissociative disorder - F44.89  
2. Dissociative amnesia - F44.0  
3. Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder - F43.8

135,"Michelle Adams, a 51-year-old former hairdresser, came to a psychiatric clinic at the urging of her primary care doctor. A note sent ahead revealed that she had been tearful and frustrated at her last medical appointment, and her doctor, who had been struggling to control the patient’s persistent back pain, felt that an evaluation by a psychiatrist might be helpful.

Greeting Ms. Adams in the waiting room, the psychiatrist was struck by both her appearance and her manner: here was a woman with shaggy silver hair and dark sunglasses, seated in a wheelchair, who offered a limp handshake and a plaintive sigh before asking the psychiatrist if he would mind pushing her wheelchair into his office. She was tired from a long commute, and, she explained, “Nobody on the street offered to help me out. Can you believe that?”

Once settled, Ms. Adams stated that she had been suffering from unbearable back pain for the previous 13 months. On the night “that changed everything,” she had locked herself out of her apartment and, while trying to climb in through a fire escape, had fallen and fractured her pelvis, coccyx, right elbow, and three ribs. Although she did not require surgery, she was bed-bound for 6 weeks and then underwent several months of physical therapy. Daily opioid medication had been only moderately helpful. She had seen “a dozen” doctors of various specialties and tried multiple treatments, including anesthetic injections and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation therapy, but her pain was unrelenting. Throughout this ordeal and for years previously, Ms. Adams smoked cannabis daily, explaining that a joint enjoyed in hourly puffs “softened” her pain and helped her to relax. She did not drink alcohol or use other illicit drugs.

Prior to the accident, Ms. Adams had worked at a neighborhood salon for more than 20 years. She was proud to have had a large number of devoted clients, and she relished the camaraderie with her colleagues, whom she referred to as “my real family.” She had been unable to return to work since her accident on account of the pain. “These doctors keep telling me I’m good to go back to work,” she said with visible anger, “but they don’t know what I’m going through.” Her voice broke. “They don’t believe me. They think I’m lying.”

She added that although friends had initially reached out after the accident, lately they had seemed less sympathetic. She let incoming telephone calls go to voice mail most of the time because she just did not feel up to socializing on account of the pain. In the previous month, she had stopped bathing daily and gotten slack about cleaning her apartment. Without the structure of work, she often found herself up until 5:00 a.m., and pain woke her several times before she finally got out of bed in the afternoon. As for her mood, she said, “I’m so depressed it’s ridiculous.” She often felt hopeless of any possibility of living without pain but denied ever thinking of suicide. She explained that her Catholic faith prevented her from considering taking her own life.

Ms. Adams had never seen a psychiatrist before and did not recall ever having felt depressed prior to her accident, although she described a “hot temper” as a family trait. She spoke of only one meaningful romantic relationship, many years previously, with a woman who was emotionally abusive. When asked about any legal difficulties, she revealed several arrests for theft in her 20s. She was “in the wrong place at the wrong time,” she said, and was never convicted of a crime.","1. Somatic symptom disorder, with predominant pain, persistent, moderate to severe
2. Cannabis use disorder
3. Major depressive disorder, single episode, chronic",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Evaluating cannabis use disorder**

I'm considering criteria for diagnosing cannabis use disorder. It could be moderate if 4-5 criteria apply, but maybe ""mild"" is a more conservative approach. Daily use over years could suggest tolerance or continued use despite issues, but that doesn't seem to apply here. For diagnosis, I think ""Cannabis Use Disorder, mild"" might work better. It requires at least 2-3 criteria. The only clear one present is the time spent using cannabis, especially if it's throughout the day.

**Analyzing cannabis use criteria**

I'm reflecting on the criteria for cannabis use disorder. One criterion is spending a lot of time on cannabis-related activities, and since she uses it throughout the day, that might count. However, I can't confirm two key criteria, such as tolerance or withdrawal. While she smokes regularly for pain relief, it's not explicitly problematic since she doesn't use other substances. Still, I think we could consider ""Cannabis Use Disorder"" in the differential diagnoses since the prompt asks for the top five likely diagnoses.

**Interpreting cannabis use diagnosis**

I recognize that this isn’t a board exam, so we can include likely diagnoses based on heavy daily use. While we shouldn't fabricate, we can interpret the situation. Heavy daily use suggests a moderate chance of cannabis use disorder since it often leads to tolerance and withdrawal, but we can’t make assumptions. We should include ""Cannabis Use Disorder"" in the structured list while providing actual diagnoses. I’ll ensure to base my conclusions solely on the provided information and my clinical expertise.

**Evaluating evidence for diagnosis**

I need to confirm that each diagnosis is backed by solid information. For cannabis use disorder, we require evidence of at least two criteria. Daily heavy cannabis use could relate to ongoing physical or psychological problems, like depressed mood or neglecting hygiene. However, these issues might stem from pain or depression — not necessarily cannabis. There’s also the criterion about failing major obligations, but this connection isn’t clear. Since we lack specific criteria, diagnosing cannabis use disorder seems unlikely. However, I can mention ""Cannabis Use, Unspecified"" even though it's not a DSM-5 diagnosis.

**Determining diagnoses based on criteria**

I'm sorting through the necessary criteria for diagnoses. DSM-5 includes ""Cannabis Use Disorder"" along with ""Cannabis Intoxication"" and even an ""Other Substance Use Disorder,"" but I want to stick to DSM names. Using ""Cannabis Use Disorder"" could be justified based on daily use, but I'm wary it might overcall the severity without clearer evidence. It’s tricky! For the final list, I'll include diagnoses that are better supported: ""Somatic Symptom Disorder,"" ""Major Depressive Disorder,"" ""Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood,"" and ""Insomnia Disorder."" Adjustment disorder makes sense here, given the context of her ongoing struggles.

**Assessing potential diagnoses**

I need to confirm that we've got the right criteria for the diagnoses. For ""Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood,"" the timeframe is flexible, which fits her situation. ""Unspecified Depressive Disorder"" might also work since we don’t have all the details. She’s been depressed since the accident, so it feels justifiable. We can include ""Insomnia Disorder"" as well and consider ""Cannabis Use Disorder,"" given her daily use. The details suggest she likely meets at least two criteria for this diagnosis. I need to avoid overpathologizing while ensuring we address her pain and mental health accurately.

**Examining diagnoses options**

I'm analyzing the situation where she mentions unbearable back pain for 13 months after fractures and the various doctors she's seen. It seems like her case could involve ""Somatic Symptom Disorder."" While I'm trying to weigh whether her response is excessive, her persistent pain and numerous doctor visits make sense. I’m considering a final list of five diagnoses, which includes ""Adjustment Disorder,"" ""Cannabis Use Disorder,"" and ""Insomnia Disorder."" I have to be careful about overlapping diagnoses and their supporting evidence to select the most accurate ones.

**Clarifying diagnostic considerations**

I’m assessing the significance of F54, which relates to psychological factors affecting medical conditions, especially in cases of chronic pain. She demonstrates behaviors indicating this, such as her use of cannabis and opioids, along with depression and poor functioning. I’m weighing whether to list ""Somatic Symptom Disorder"" or ""Major Depressive Disorder"" as primary. It’s tricky since her depression seems closely tied to her pain, complicating the distinctions. I also ponder other potential diagnoses but hesitate to make unsupported claims based on incomplete information.

**Finalizing diagnostic list**

I’m reviewing the DSM categories, focusing on “Other Specified Depressive Disorder,” which is used when symptoms cause notable distress but don’t fully meet other criteria. I’m deciding if I should list this one or adjust it to ""Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood."" Given the timeline of 13 months, I’m leaning towards ""Other Specified Depressive Disorder."" I’ll finalize the top 5 diagnoses as follows: 

1. Somatic Symptom Disorder, with predominant pain, persistent - F45.1  
2. Other Specified Depressive Disorder - F32.8  
3. Cannabis Use Disorder, mild - F12.10  
4. Insomnia Disorder - F51.01  
5. Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions - F54

**Deciding on depressive diagnoses**

I’m exploring the options for classifying insomnia. F51.01 is primary insomnia, while F51.09 refers to other types not due to substance or known conditions. Given the context, I will stick with F51.01. 

Now for depression, ""Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood"" seems more fitting due to the recent fall and its aftermath. Although ""Other Specified Depressive Disorder"" is also a possibility, I'll finalize the top 5 as follows:

1. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood - F43.21  
2. Somatic Symptom Disorder - F45.1  
3. Cannabis Use Disorder, mild - F12.10  
4. Insomnia Disorder - F51.01  
5. Psychological Factors Affecting Other Conditions - F54

**Choosing diagnoses carefully**

I’m examining ""Other Specified Depressive Disorder"" as it doesn’t require an onset time and seems fitting. It indicates a subthreshold Major Depressive Episode (F32.8). For cannabis use, I think “Cannabis Use Disorder” without severity coding would work, so I’ll likely stick with F12.10. 

Now for insomnia, she’s struggling significantly, which supports diagnosing insomnia disorder. Psychological factors affecting her medical condition could also apply, but it’s not clear if she meets criteria for that. I may also consider somatic symptom disorder due to her distressing pain. 

So, the top diagnoses might include:
1. Other Specified Depressive Disorder - F32.8  
2. Cannabis Use Disorder - F12.10  
3. Insomnia Disorder - F51.01  
4. Somatic Symptom Disorder - F45.1  
5. Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions - F54

**Analyzing potential diagnoses**

I’m thinking the patient might be depressed due to chronic pain, with symptoms like irregular sleep, poor hygiene, and social withdrawal indicating possible significant depression. However, she denies suicidality. Her mood seems intertwined with pain, suggesting her primary diagnosis could be ""Somatic Symptom Disorder, persistent, with predominant pain."" 

For the F-codes, I'll assign:
1. Somatic Symptom Disorder: F45.1
2. Other Specified Depressive Disorder: F32.8
3. Cannabis Use Disorder, mild: F12.10
4. Insomnia Disorder: F51.01
5. Unspecified Personality Disorder: F60.9, or possibly include Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions: F54, depending on further evidence. 

I just need to ensure the diagnoses chosen truly reflect her condition.

**Finalizing diagnoses**

I'll be listing the refined diagnoses, aiming for accuracy. So, here’s what I’m considering:

1. Somatic Symptom Disorder, with predominant pain, persistent - F45.1
2. Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood - F43.21
3. Cannabis Use Disorder, mild - F12.10
4. Insomnia Disorder - F51.01
5. Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions - F54

This selection reflects the patient’s situation and symptoms while adhering to the DSM-5-TR requirements. I believe this captures her concerns comprehensively!

**Refining diagnoses list**

I'm looking to clarify the psychiatric diagnoses based on the patient's situation. 

1. Somatic Symptom Disorder with predominant pain, persistent - F45.1  
2. Other specified depressive disorder - F32.8  
3. Cannabis Use Disorder, mild - F12.10  
4. Insomnia Disorder - F51.01  
5. Unspecified personality disorder - F60.9  

It seems appropriate to present plausible comorbidities without contradictions. I want to ensure this reflects the complexities of the case according to DSM-5-TR standards. This structure gives a comprehensive view of the patient's mental health challenges!

**Finalizing diagnoses structure**

I need to choose one mood disorder diagnosis, likely sticking with ""Major Depressive Disorder"" as criteria are mostly met, but I'll consider alternatives. 

For the secondary diagnoses, I think I could include:

1. Somatic Symptom Disorder, with predominant pain - F45.1  
2. Unspecified Depressive Disorder - F32.9  
3. Cannabis Use Disorder, mild - F12.10  
4. Insomnia Disorder - F51.01  
5. Other specified personality disorder - F60.89  

This set should reflect co-occurring conditions appropriately, capturing the complexities without assumptions!

**Assessing potential diagnoses**

I’m trying to piece together a set of diagnoses based on the criteria I've reviewed. Ideally, I need to include ""Cannabis use disorder"" as a probable diagnosis, but I’m hesitant about labeling it as a disorder since the usage might not meet the criteria.

For the fifth diagnosis, I think ""Unspecified personality disorder"" could work, especially considering the family traits and some behavioral patterns, but I’m uncertain if there’s enough evidence for a full diagnosis. There are complexities involving psychological factors affecting medical conditions to consider as well. I need to weigh these options carefully!

**Finalizing diagnosis details**

I’m trying to finalize the list of diagnoses while ensuring I respect the criteria. I think ""Other specified personality disorder"" could work if it causes significant impairment, but I also consider ""Cannabis use disorder"" and possibly ""Opioid use disorder."" 

For the list, I’m planning on: Somatic Symptom Disorder, Unspecified Depressive Disorder, mild Cannabis Use Disorder, Insomnia Disorder, and Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions. I’m double-checking the codes, especially for unspecified depressive disorder, since it’s a little unclear in regards to ICD-10 updates!

**Confirming diagnosis mapping**

I’m reviewing the mapping for depressive disorders. In DSM-5, ""Other specified depressive disorder"" is coded as F32.8 and ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" as F32.9. In DSM-5-TR, ""Other specified depressive disorder"" may still be F32.8, while ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" might be F32.A. I’m considering using “Major depressive disorder” (MDD) for clarity but uncertain if the criteria is fully met. 

Given her symptoms, including depressed mood and social isolation, it’s reasonable to select Adjusted Disorder with depressed mood, as it requires fewer specific symptoms without ambiguity.

**Deciding on diagnoses**

I’m considering the potential diagnoses for the user’s case. For cannabis use, I think I can include ""Cannabis use disorder, mild."" Insomnia and possible personality disorders are on the table as well, but I’m hesitant to assign them without more information. 

I intend to finalize a list of top five plausible diagnoses, likely starting with ""Somatic Symptom Disorder,"" paired with ""Adjustment Disorder."" I could think about adding ""Cannabis Use Disorder"" and ""Insomnia Disorder."" I could tentatively include ""Other Specified Personality Disorder"" too, while aiming to provide a balanced overview.

**Formulating differential diagnoses**

The user wants a structured list of the top five most likely diagnoses, emphasizing differential rather than comorbidity. I’ll distinguish primary from secondary diagnoses to clarify their likelihood.

I believe “Somatic Symptom Disorder” should be the primary diagnosis, given its prominence in the case. I'd follow with “Major Depressive Disorder” and “Adjustment Disorder,” then include “Cannabis Use Disorder” as well as “Insomnia Disorder.” It’s crucial to stick to the five diagnoses requested while ensuring they align with the symptoms described.

**Finalizing differential diagnoses**

The user is looking for the top five most likely diagnoses based on the provided information. I believe ""Somatic Symptom Disorder"" should be highlighted as the primary diagnosis due to its prominence, followed by ""Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood."" 

Next, I'd include ""Major Depressive Disorder,"" ""Cannabis Use Disorder,"" and ""Insomnia Disorder."" I’m cautiously evaluating the severity of ""Cannabis Use Disorder,"" leaning towards ""moderate"" as a reasonable choice. However, I may also consider ""unspecified"" for ""Major Depressive Disorder"" to provide flexibility based on limited information.

**Finalizing the diagnoses list**

I’m leaning towards using ""Cannabis Use Disorder"" with a mild severity, coded F12.10, since daily use suggests some symptoms, but we can't confirm the severity definitively. For the top five diagnoses, I’m considering:

1. Somatic Symptom Disorder, with predominant pain, persistent - F45.1  
2. Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, unspecified - F32.9  
3. Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood - F43.21  
4. Cannabis Use Disorder, mild - F12.10  
5. Insomnia Disorder - F51.01  

This structure flows well and maintains clarity while following the instructions.","1. Somatic Symptom Disorder, with predominant pain, persistent - F45.1

136,"Norma Balaban, a 37-year-old married woman who worked as an administrative assistant to a university dean, was referred by her primary care physician for evaluation of depression and multiple somatic symptoms. She had been generally healthy, other than binge eating and obesity, until a year earlier and had undergone gastric bypass surgery 6 years earlier.

As she entered the consulting room, Ms. Balaban handed the psychiatrist a three-page summary of her physical concerns. Nocturnal leg spasms and daytime leg aches had been her initial concerns. She then developed sleep difficulties that led to “brain fog” and head heaviness. She had intermittent cold sensations in her extremities, face, ears, eyes, and nasal passages. Pulsating sensations in her eyes were, she thought, more pronounced after a poor night’s sleep. In recent months, she had developed difficulty urinating, menstrual irregularity, and multiple muscle complaints, including right gluteal pain with a burning sensation into her right thigh. She also had neck stiffness with accompanying thoracic back spasms.

Ms. Balaban’s primary care physician had evaluated the initial symptoms and then referred her to a rheumatologist and a neurologist. The rheumatologist diagnosed mechanical back pain without evidence of inflammatory arthritis. She had also diagnosed possible migraines with peripheral neuropathic and ocular symptoms. The neurologist noted that Ms. Balaban was also being evaluated by a neurologist and a neuro-ophthalmologist at a nearby medical center. The other neurologist concluded her evaluation with a provisional diagnosis of “atypical migraine variant,” noting that “the patient seemed to also have a significant degree of depression, which might be aggravating the symptoms or even be an underlying precipitating factor.” A review of tests done at the two medical centers indicated that Ms. Balaban had received the following essentially normal tests: two electroencephalograms, an electromyogram, three brain and three spinal magnetic resonance images, two lumbar puncture studies, and serial laboratory exams. Psychiatric consultation had been recommended, but the patient declined until repeatedly urged by her primary care physician.

Ms. Balaban initially spoke to the psychiatrist primarily about her physical complaints. She was very frustrated that despite having seen several specialists, she had received no clear diagnosis, and she was still very concerned about her symptoms. She had started taking fluoxetine and gabapentin, prescribed by her primary care physician, and experienced partial improvement in her mood and some of her pains. She found it difficult to concentrate and complete her work and was spending a lot of time on the internet researching her symptoms. For the past several months, she had kept a spreadsheet that tried to link her symptoms to her blood pressure and pulse.

She also felt bad about not spending enough time with her children or husband, but just did not have the energy. She acknowledged bouts of depressed mood over the prior year with some anhedonia and occasional thoughts of suicide (she had considered crashing her car), but no anorexia or guilt. She described having experienced premenstrual depressive symptoms for about a year.

Ms. Balaban had been treated for postpartum depression 6 years earlier after the birth of her second child. Family history was significant for cancer, depression, and hypertension.

Ms. Balaban lived with her husband and their daughters, ages 10 and 6 years. Her husband was being treated for depression. The patient had graduated from college and was the longtime administrative assistant to a dean at the local university. She grew up in a small town in a rural area. She reported a happy childhood and denied any experiences of physical or sexual abuse. There was no history of a substance use disorder.

On mental status examination, the patient was alert, casually but neatly dressed, cooperative, and not at all defensive. Her mood and affect were depressed, and she demonstrated psychomotor retardation. There were no abnormalities of thought process or content, no abnormalities of perception, and no evident cognitive dysfunction.",Somatic symptom disorder,dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Evaluating diagnosis codes**

I’m checking the ICD-10-CM code for illness anxiety disorder, which is F45.21. I wonder if this code translates in the DSM-5 crosswalk. Can we list both somatic symptom disorder (SSD) and illness anxiety disorder, even though they’re usually mutually exclusive? SSD is preferred when somatic symptoms are present, but health anxiety might still be part of SSD. Insomnia could be relevant too, possibly listed as secondary. Then I need to consider binge-eating disorder and major depressive disorder with peripartum onset.

**Determining diagnosis options**

It's better to provide a top 5 list of diagnoses: 1) Somatic Symptom Disorder, 2) Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, 3) Illness Anxiety Disorder (or possibly Generalized Anxiety Disorder), 4) Binge-eating Disorder, and 5) Insomnia Disorder. Now, I need to select four secondary diagnoses, making sure they're plausible and not fabricated. While there's significant health-related anxiety, her multiple distressing somatic symptoms suggest that Illness Anxiety might not be the best fit. Maybe I should list Somatic Symptom Disorder with the specifier for predominant health anxiety?

**Choosing primary diagnoses**

I realize that I can include Illness Anxiety Disorder as a differential, but I need to present clear diagnoses. Based on the information, I’m considering the top five most likely:  

1) Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, moderate (F33.1) as primary,  
2) Somatic Symptom Disorder, persistent (F45.1),  
3) Binge-eating Disorder (F50.81),  
4) Insomnia Disorder (F51.01),  
5) Illness Anxiety Disorder (F45.21) or Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1).  

The primary diagnosis might best be Major Depressive Disorder, given her significant symptoms and mood improvements from medication, even though her main concern is physical symptoms.

**Selecting and ranking diagnoses**

I need to determine the most relevant diagnoses based on her numerous somatic symptoms, especially since the workup returned negative results. It’s possible she's dealing with Somatic Symptom Disorder along with depression. The challenge is deciding which condition is more central. I need to stick to diagnoses and their corresponding codes, without venturing into reasoning. I'll focus on aligning with DSM-5-TR criteria, carefully analyzing each potential diagnosis to ensure everything is supported and correctly coded.

**Identifying potential diagnoses**

I have a lot of information to work with here regarding the patient's symptoms and history. I need to focus on identifying the top five diagnoses based on her condition.  

I'm considering:  
1) Somatic Symptom Disorder, persistent, with predominant pain (F45.1)  
2) Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent episode, moderate (F33.1)  
3) Illness Anxiety Disorder (F45.21) but I’m unsure if that fits since SSD is present.  
4) Binge-eating Disorder (F50.81) since there's prior mention.  
5) Insomnia Disorder (F51.01) due to significant sleep difficulties.  

However, I need to ensure that any diagnosis aligns well with the DSM-5 criteria without making assumptions.

**Evaluating top diagnoses**

I need to finalize the top five likely diagnoses for this case. 

I’m leaning towards:  
1) Somatic Symptom Disorder, persistent, with predominant pain (F45.1) as the primary diagnosis since her predominant issues are somatic.  
2) Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, moderate (F33.1) as a secondary diagnosis because depression is significant.  
3) Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9) since her worries are health-focused.  
4) Binge-eating disorder (F50.81) based on her history.  
5) Insomnia disorder (F51.01) due to her sleep issues. 

I need to ensure everything aligns well with the ICD-10 codes.

**Finalizing diagnoses and codes**

For the diagnoses, I should focus on providing the top five most plausible ones along with their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes. 

I believe I can list:  
1) Somatic Symptom Disorder, persistent, with predominant pain (F45.1).  
2) Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, moderate (F33.1).  
3) Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9).  
4) Binge-eating disorder (F50.81).  
5) Insomnia disorder (F51.01) if it's considered valid as an F-code. 

I need to ensure these choices align with the user's instructions and have adequate support from the information provided.

**Finalizing diagnoses for mental health**

I need to come up with a structured list of five psychiatric diagnoses along with their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes. It looks like I can include Somatic Symptom Disorder (F45.1) as my primary diagnosis because of the persistent pain presented. Next, Major Depressive Disorder (F33.1) fits as a secondary diagnosis. I think Binge-Eating Disorder (F50.81) can be third. For fourth, I can list Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9) due to health concerns. Finally, I’ll add Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions (F54). This set feels well-rounded based on the information provided!

**Finalizing psychiatric diagnoses list**

I need to create a structured list of five most likely psychiatric diagnoses with their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes. Here’s what I’m thinking: first, I’ll include Somatic Symptom Disorder (F45.1) due to the persistent symptoms. Second, I’ll add Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent (F33.1) as the secondary diagnosis. Third, I’ll list Binge Eating Disorder (F50.81). Fourth, I’ll go with Illness Anxiety Disorder (F45.21). Lastly, I’ll include Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1). This way, I cover a range of conditions appropriately!

**Reviewing diagnostic codes**

I'm verifying the ICD-10 codes for some potential diagnoses. For my primary diagnosis, I'll go with Somatic Symptom Disorder (F45.1). Next, Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, moderate (F33.1) seems appropriate. For the third and fourth diagnoses, I'll list Binge-Eating Disorder (F50.81) and Illness Anxiety Disorder (F45.21). Lastly, I’m considering Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions (F54). While there might be some overlap, I think it's crucial to include these factors for a comprehensive view.

**Determining diagnosis codes**

I'm contemplating the best possible diagnoses. For the top five, I think: 1) Somatic Symptom Disorder (F45.1), 2) Major Depressive Disorder (F33.1), 3) Binge-Eating Disorder (F50.81), 4) Illness Anxiety Disorder (F45.21), and 5) Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions (F54). However, I also considered unspecified anxiety disorder, but it might be redundant. My focus is ensuring the chosen codes are appropriate and reflect the patient's condition accurately while keeping in mind their extensive symptoms.

**Clarifying diagnosis options**

I’m thinking through the best diagnoses here. F54 is tricky since it needs a direct medical condition, and while psychological factors may affect existing issues, it might not align perfectly. Somatic symptoms are primary, so maybe I don’t need F54. Instead, I’m considering major depressive disorder, binge-eating disorder, illness anxiety disorder, and possibly obsessive-compulsive disorder. The key is finding the top five most appropriate diagnoses without including unnecessary ones, ensuring they all make sense based on the provided context.

**Determining primary diagnoses**

I’m analyzing the best diagnoses based on what's relevant. The binge-eating disorder, illness anxiety disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder codes are clear. However, I need to identify the top five that reflect the patient's current symptoms while keeping it plausible. I think somatic symptom disorder and major depressive disorder should be primary, followed by binge-eating disorder. I’m also weighing whether to include generalized anxiety disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder as a fifth option, balancing current symptoms with historical factors. I'll refine the list accordingly!

**Listing psychiatric diagnoses**

It seems the user is asking for DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses based on information provided. I need to compile a structured list of diagnoses and their codes, ensuring clarity and relevance. The diagnoses I'm considering include Somatic Symptom Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Binge-Eating Disorder, and Illness Anxiety Disorder. I’m also debating whether to include an unspecified anxiety disorder or potentially psychological factors affecting other medical conditions. Ultimately, I'll finalize five diagnoses with their correct severity codes based on the context and symptoms described.

**Deciding on diagnoses**

I’m considering how to list the diagnoses for the case at hand. I think it makes sense to highlight the primary somatic symptom disorder as the most likely diagnosis, followed by major depressive disorder and other relevant conditions, including binge-eating disorder and illness anxiety disorder. I need to weigh each diagnosis carefully, avoiding redundancy while ensuring we capture the patient's situation accurately. It's a balancing act between which symptoms are present and the patient's history. I'll finalize a concise list with relevant DSM-5-TR codes.

**Finalizing the diagnoses list**

I’m working on finalizing the top five psychiatric diagnoses from the case. The main diagnosis will be somatic symptom disorder, followed by major depressive disorder. I’m considering including illness anxiety disorder and either unspecified anxiety or binge-eating disorder as a comorbid condition. However, I need to ensure there’s no overlap. I think it's best to stick with these diagnoses and their corresponding ICD-10 codes, focusing on what's most relevant and supported by the case details. I’ll finalize it now.

**Finalizing the diagnosis list**

I'm finalizing the five psychiatric diagnoses for the case. The primary diagnosis will be somatic symptom disorder (SSD), followed by major depressive disorder (MDD). Then, I'll include illness anxiety disorder (IAD) and binge-eating disorder as third and fourth. For the fifth, I’m debating between unspecified anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). While I think I'll stick with unspecified anxiety for simplicity, the final output will be clear. I need to ensure it's formatted correctly with each diagnosis labeled by its ICD-10 code.","1.

137,"Oscar Capek, a 43-year-old man, was brought by his wife to an emergency room (ER) for what he described as a relapse of his chronic Lyme disease. He explained that he had been fatigued for a month and bedridden for a week. Then, saying he was too tired and confused to give much information, he asked the ER team to call his psychiatrist.

The psychiatrist reported that he had treated Mr. Capek for more than two decades. He first saw Mr. Capek for a panic attack. It resolved with surprisingly small doses of clonazepam. After that, however, Mr. Capek continued to see him for help coping with his chronic illness. Initially a graduate student pursuing a master’s degree in accounting, Mr. Capek dropped out of school over worries that the demands of his studies would exacerbate his disease. Since that time, his wife, a registered nurse, had been his primary support. He supplemented their income with small accounting jobs but limited these lest the stress affect his health.

Mr. Capek usually felt physically and emotionally well. He deemed his occasional fatigue, anxiety, and concentration difficulties “controllable” and did not require treatment. Mr. Capek was typically averse to psychotropic medications and took a homeopathic approach to his disease, including exercise and proper nutrition. When his panic symptoms would reemerge, he used small doses (e.g., one-quarter of a 0.5-mg lorazepam pill). His psychiatric sessions were commonly concerned about his underlying disease; he often brought articles on chronic Lyme disease for discussion and was active in a local Lyme disease support group.

Mr. Capek’s symptoms would occasionally worsen. However, these worsenings occurred less than yearly, and these “exacerbations” usually related to some apparent stress. The worst episode had been 1 year earlier, when his wife briefly left him following his revelation of an affair. Mr. Capek expressed shame about his behavior toward his wife—both the affair and his inability to support her. He subsequently cut off contact with the other woman and attempted to expand his accounting work. The psychiatrist speculated that similar stress was behind his current symptoms.

The psychiatrist communicated regularly with Mr. Capek’s internist. His Lyme disease tests had thus far been negative. When the internist reported this, Mr. Capek became defensive and produced literature on the inaccuracy of Lyme disease testing. Eventually, the internist and the psychiatrist agreed on a conservative treatment approach with a neutral stance regarding the disease’s validity.

On examination, Mr. Capek was a healthy, well-developed adult male. He was anxious and spoke quietly with his eyes closed. He frequently lost his train of thought, but with encouragement and patience, he could give a detailed history consistent with the psychiatrist’s account. Physical examination findings were unremarkable, and a standard laboratory screen was normal except for a slightly low hemoglobin value. The medical team chose to defer further Lyme testing, given the patient’s many past negative tests. However, on hearing about the low hemoglobin, Mr. Capek became alarmed, dismissed reassurances, and insisted that the team investigate this further.","1. Illness anxiety disorder, care-seeking type
2. Panic disorder",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Evaluating ICD-10-CM Coding**

I'm considering how to code for various disorders in ICD-10-CM. For somatic symptom disorder, the code is F45.1; for illness anxiety disorder, it’s F45.21; and for panic disorder, it’s F41.0. Generalized anxiety disorder is coded as F41.1, while adjustment disorder with anxiety is F43.22. Delusional disorder is labeled F22, specifically the somatic type. I also note various depressive disorders, and it might be helpful to include the ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" code F41.8 where necessary.

**Analyzing Panic Disorder Symptoms**

I'm considering whether to classify the user as having somatic symptom disorder, panic disorder, and an other specified obsessive-compulsive disorder related to health anxiety. The person initially experienced a panic attack that resolved with small doses of clonazepam, which might indicate it was a single event. However, recurring symptoms emerged later with lorazepam, suggesting these could be recurrent panic attacks. I can’t diagnose panic attacks alone, but it seems reasonable to consider a diagnosis of panic disorder given the long history of treatment.

**Finalizing Diagnosis List**

The psychiatrist treated the user for initial panic attacks, but it's unclear if he has panic disorder—though it seems likely. Alternatives could be ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" or ""Unspecified anxiety disorder."" While he experiences panic attacks, I also need to consider if we should include ""Panic disorder"" for completeness. There's a possibility of benzodiazepine use disorder, but it seems unlikely with no evidence of misuse. I’m leaning toward final diagnoses like ""Somatic symptom disorder"" and ""Anxiety disorder, unspecified.” Now, I’ll create the final list.

**Clarifying Diagnoses**

I’m considering whether it's appropriate to diagnose both Somatic Symptom Disorder (SSD) and Illness Anxiety Disorder (IAD). The DSM guidelines generally don’t allow both to be diagnosed, but I can include them in a differential list. The user requested the top 5 likely diagnoses, which gives me some flexibility. It might be reasonable to list SSD as primary, followed by Panic Disorder, IAD as differential, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Delusional Disorder of the somatic type. Lately, I'm verifying the correct ICD-10 codes, noting that F45.1 is undifferentiated somatoform disorder.

**Determining Primary and Secondary Diagnoses**

I’m weighing whether to diagnose the user with Generalized Anxiety Disorder or Unspecified Anxiety Disorder. For the top five, I must decide between Somatic Symptom Disorder (SSD) and Illness Anxiety Disorder (IAD) as primary. His significant fatigue and being bedridden suggest prominent somatic symptoms, making SSD more likely. The fatigue seems severe, which contradicts mild symptoms required for IAD. I’m thinking of listing SSD as primary and including Panic Disorder, Illness Anxiety Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and potentially Adjustment Disorder or Delusional Disorder as secondary options.

**Creating the Differential Diagnosis List**

I’m considering the top five psychiatric diagnoses for this case. First, I’m leaning toward Somatic Symptom Disorder, given the patient's significant distress and impairment due to his symptoms. For the second diagnosis, Panic Disorder makes sense because of the recurrence of his panic symptoms. Illness Anxiety Disorder could be third as a differential if his symptoms are mild. I might also list Generalized Anxiety Disorder or Unspecified Anxiety Disorder as a fourth. Let’s organize these into a structured list, keeping it concise.

1. Somatic Symptom Disorder - F45.1  
2. Panic Disorder - F41.0  
3. Illness Anxiety Disorder - F45.21  
4. Generalized Anxiety Disorder - F41.1  
5. Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety - F43.22

**Selecting Secondary Diagnoses**

I’m evaluating the likelihood of secondary diagnoses: either Delusional Disorder or Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety seems plausible here. There was past stress relating to the patient's affair and wife leaving, but it’s unclear if current symptoms relate to a specific stressor. Adjustment Disorder usually follows identifiable stress. I might also consider ""Other Specified Anxiety Disorder"" instead of Generalized Anxiety Disorder since he exhibits health-related anxiety, alongside panic and somatic symptoms.  

Here’s my final top five diagnosis list:  
1. Somatic Symptom Disorder - F45.1  
2. Panic Disorder - F41.0  
3. Illness Anxiety Disorder - F45.21  
4. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder - F41.8  
5. Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety - F43.22

**Refining Differential Diagnoses**

To diagnose Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), there needs to be at least six months of excessive worry, but the patient's symptoms aren't fully meeting the criteria. Instead, ""Unspecified Anxiety Disorder"" or ""Other Specified Anxiety Disorder"" might capture his chronic anxiety well. I’m considering the top five plausible diagnoses, including: Somatic Symptom Disorder, Illness Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Unspecified Anxiety Disorder, and Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety.  

It seems better to focus on diagnoses that relate to his presentation, balancing evidence and plausibility.

**Finalizing Diagnostic Impression**

I’m considering that F54 is for psychological factors affecting a medical condition, but it doesn’t quite fit here. Maybe ""Somatic Symptom Disorder"" is sufficient, yet I’m drafting a list of top diagnoses. I see five potential names, including Illness Anxiety Disorder, which better reflects his current condition of worrying about Lyme disease despite being mostly well.

The emphasis here is on his preoccupation with illness rather than severe symptoms. It's clear that his anxiety leads to functional impairment, so I think Illness Anxiety Disorder might be the most accurate diagnosis.

**Finalizing Diagnostic List**

I’m weighing my options between Illness Anxiety Disorder (IAD) and Somatic Symptom Disorder (SSD). The key problem appears to be his anxiety and preoccupation with having Lyme disease despite negative tests. IAD seems to better capture this persistent health anxiety, but he does report significant fatigue, which leans more toward SSD. Given these considerations, I’m planning to finalize the top diagnoses, including both conditions, while also ensuring they align with the DSM-5-TR criteria.

**Finalizing Diagnostic Considerations**

It seems I should classify the primary diagnosis as Somatic Symptom Disorder (SSD) due to the significant somatic symptoms like fatigue. This fits better than Illness Anxiety Disorder (IAD), especially considering the patient’s current condition of being bedridden. For the secondary diagnoses, I’m leaning toward Panic Disorder, Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety, and possibly an Unspecified Anxiety Disorder. There's also the option of including other specified anxiety disorders if needed, but let's keep it streamlined for clarity.

**Listing Diagnoses and Codes**

I must provide the top five most likely diagnoses based on the user's criteria, without adding reasoning or non-psychiatric conditions like anemia. My primary diagnosis will be Somatic Symptom Disorder. The secondary ones will comprise Illness Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety, and Unspecified Anxiety Disorder. 

Here’s the final list:  
1. Somatic Symptom Disorder - F45.1  
2. Illness Anxiety Disorder, care-seeking type - F45.21

138,"Paulina Delcampo, a 32-year-old single woman with epilepsy that was first diagnosed during adolescence, was admitted to an academic medical center after her family found her convulsing in her bedroom. Before she was taken to the emergency room (ER), emergency medical services administered several doses of lorazepam, with no change in her condition. On arrival at the ER, a loading dose of fosphenytoin was administered to her; it stopped the convulsive activity. Blood tests obtained in the ER revealed therapeutic levels of her usual antiepileptics and no evidence of any infection or metabolic disturbance. Urine toxicology screens were negative for the use of illicit substances. Ms. Delcampo was admitted to the neurology service for further monitoring.

During her admission, a routine electroencephalogram (EEG) was ordered. Shortly after the study began, Ms. Delcampo began convulsing; this prompted administration of intravenous (IV) lorazepam. When the EEG was reviewed, no epileptiform activity was identified. Ms. Delcampo was placed on video-EEG (vEEG) monitoring, and her antiepileptics were tapered and discontinued. In the course of her monitoring, Ms. Delcampo had several episodes of convulsive motor activity; however, none was associated with epileptiform activity on the EEG. Psychiatric consultation was requested.

On interview, Ms. Delcampo denied prior psychiatric evaluations, diagnoses, or treatments. She denied having depressed mood or any disturbance of sleep, energy, concentration, or appetite. She reported no thoughts of harming herself or others. She endorsed no signs or symptoms consistent with mania or psychosis. There was no family history of psychiatric illness or substance abuse. Her examination revealed a well-groomed woman, sitting on her hospital bed with EEG leads in place. She was pleasant and engaged, and she made good eye contact. Cognitive testing revealed no deficits.

Ms. Delcampo noted that she had recently moved to the state to begin graduate school; she was excited about starting her studies and “finally getting my career on track.” She denied any recent specific psychosocial stressors other than her move and said, “My life is finally where I want it to be.” She was future oriented and concerned about the impact that her seizures might have on her long-term health. She was worried that a protracted hospitalization might cause her to miss the first day of classes (only a week away from the time of the interview). Moreover, she was quite concerned about the costs of her hospitalization because her health insurance coverage did not begin until the school semester commenced and the payment for extended benefits coverage from her previous employer would have a significant impact on her budget.

When the findings of the vEEG study were discussed with Ms. Delcampo, she quickly became quite irritable, asking, “So, everyone thinks I’m just making this up?” She was not calmed by her treaters’ attempts to clarify that they did not believe her to be faking her symptoms or by their reassurance that her symptoms might be helped by structured therapy. Ms. Delcampo pulled her EEG leads from her scalp, dressed herself, and left the hospital against medical advice.","Functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder) with attacks or seizures, persistent",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Confirming ICD-10 Codes**

I'm checking the ICD-10-CM codes for various disorders. F44.4 is for conversion disorder with motor symptoms, and F44.5 is for conversion disorder with seizures. DSM-5-TR maps these to Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder as 300.11 (F44.4), but the specifier ""with attacks or seizures"" is F44.5. I've seen many sources list psychogenic nonepileptic seizures as F44.5, so I feel confident we should use that. I'm verifying others like F54 for psychological factors impacting conditions and a few others. I’ll focus on the first four.

**Ranking Plausible Disorders**

I’m thinking about which four disorders are most plausible here, and ranking them could help. I’d go with Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder (F44.5) first, then Psychological factors affecting a medical condition (F54), followed by Adjustment Disorder with anxiety (F43.22) and Somatic Symptom Disorder (F45.1). 

I wonder if Illness Anxiety Disorder might be more relevant than Factitious Disorder because she seems concerned about health but not preoccupied with a serious illness. Factitious doesn't fit either since she’s looking forward to starting school and cutting costs. Adjustments and psychological factors seem okay, but I might also consider ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" with the code F41.8 instead.

**Evaluating Anxiety and Dissociative Disorders**

I’m looking into the codes for various anxiety and somatic disorders. ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" is F41.8, while ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" is F41.9. I might consider including ""Unspecified somatic symptom disorder"" (F45.9), but I’m unsure about that. I also think of ""Other specified dissociative disorder"" (F44.89) as a differential, but Factitious Disorder, while less likely, is still in the top five for consideration due to possible malingering.

However, since I need five, I'll include standard differentials of PNES like Conversion Disorder, Factitious Disorder, and possibly Somatic Symptom Disorder. There aren't clear features of dissociation, given there's no mention of depersonalization or derealization, so I'll need to assess that carefully.

**Considering Additional Diagnoses**

I'm looking at the possibility of including ""Dissociative Disorder, Unspecified"" (F44.9) as a differential. However, that might not be the best choice. I also think about ""Unspecified Depressive Disorder"" (F32.A), but since she denies experiencing a depressed mood, it doesn’t fit either. 

I considered mentioning ""No mental disorder,"" but that doesn't seem appropriate in this case. It’s tricky to find the right coding when the symptoms don’t align perfectly!

I'm weighing potential diagnoses based on the case details we have. My primary choice is Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder with attacks or seizures (F44.5). Next, Adjustment Disorder with anxiety (F43.22) seems plausible due to life transitions and financial concerns, even if she denies significant stress. I also consider Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9) due to her worries about costs. Somatic Symptom Disorder (F45.1) fits because she’s health-conscious but not necessarily excessive.

Factitious Disorder (F68.10) might be in the mix but seems less likely. I’ll focus on verifying that each diagnosis aligns with DSM-5-TR codes and ensure a solid final list of four plausible options. Let’s piece together the essential data and prioritize carefully!

I’m comparing ""Somatic Symptom Disorder"" with ""Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder."" They can co-occur, but conversion is more about neurological symptoms, while somatic symptoms involve excessive thoughts about health—though not necessarily medically unexplained. Given her worries about seizures, it might be fitting to include ""Adjustment Disorder, Unspecified"" based on life and financial stressors.

I’m prioritizing the top diagnoses: 
1. Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder (F44.5)
2. Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions (F54)
3. Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety (F43.22)
4. Somatic Symptom Disorder (F45.1)
5. Factitious Disorder Imposed on Self (F68.10)

I’ll ensure these align with DSM-5-TR criteria and analyze whether they are the most plausible options while keeping in mind we should stick to the presented information for accuracy!

I'm weighing the distinctions between ""Factitious Disorder"" and ""Somatic Symptom Disorder."" Factitious requires intentional falsification, and listing it as likely might not be appropriate. When structuring my DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses, I need to propose a primary diagnosis and four secondary ones, treating secondary as differential diagnoses.

Based on the information, my rankings might be: 
1. Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder (F44.5)
2. Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety (F43.22)
3. Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions (F54)
4. Somatic Symptom Disorder (F45.1)
5. Factitious Disorder Imposed on Self (F68.10)

I want to ensure these are plausible while accurately reflecting the case's nuances!

I'm considering various possible diagnoses and their plausibility. For example, ""Other specified dissociative disorder"" might relate to dissociative seizures, but the DSM-5 categorizes PNES under functional neurological symptom disorder. I also think about including ""Adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct"" due to stress. 

Ultimately, I plan to finalize a list that includes:
1. Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder (F44.5)
2. Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety (F43.22)
3. Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions (F54)
4. Somatic Symptom Disorder (F45.1)
5. Factitious Disorder Imposed on Self (F68.10). 

This should effectively cover the differential diagnoses!

139,"A hospital-based psychiatric consultation-liaison service was called to assess possible depression in Rebecca Ehrlich, a 24-year-old woman who had been hospitalized 2 days earlier for severe abdominal pain. She had been admitted through the emergency room for the latest flare-up of her underlying Crohn’s disease. The consultation was called after the nurses became concerned that she was sad and lonely and was having a difficult time adjusting to her medical condition.

Ms. Ehrlich was interviewed by the medical student on the psychiatry service. The patient indicated that the pain was excruciating and that she was neither sad nor lonely but was simply visiting from out of town, so no one knew she was even in the hospital. She told the medical student that her only previous therapy had been in college, when she went to student health services to get help for anxiety about test taking and her career choice. She had successfully completed a short course of cognitive-behavioral therapy, and the anxiety had not reappeared. She denied any other psychiatric history and had never taken psychiatric medication. In college, she studied psychology and worked part-time as a hospital orderly. Ms. Ehrlich had considered a career in medicine or nursing and asked the student how he had decided to go to medical school.

Ms. Ehrlich reported that she had previously worked regularly and had “quite a few friends,” but that the recurrent abdominal pain had wrecked her social life and her job prospects. She had lost a job the year before because of absenteeism and had missed several job interviews due to her Crohn’s flares. She had dated as a teenager but had been in no relationships since starting college. These things “were not the end of the world, but how would you feel?” As a member of an online bowel disorders support group, Ms. Ehrlich e-mailed other members on a daily basis. She added that the only person in the family who “got” her was an aunt who also had Crohn’s disease.

The primary medical team was having difficulty obtaining collateral information from previous physicians, but the medical student was able to contact Ms. Ehrlich’s mother. She did not know the exact names or phone numbers of her daughter’s medical providers but did recall some of the hospitals and could recall, approximately, some of the physicians’ names. She added that her daughter had not wanted her to be involved in her care and had not told her she was out of town, much less that she was in the hospital. She did say that the Crohn’s disease had been diagnosed 2 years earlier, during her daughter’s last semester of college. The mother estimated that Ms. Ehrlich had been hospitalized at least six times, in contrast with the daughter’s report of two earlier hospitalizations. Neither the gastrointestinal (GI) team nor the medical student was able to locate Ms. Ehrlich’s primary gastroenterologist, whose name the patient could spell only phonetically.

On examination, Ms. Ehrlich was cooperative and conversant, and appeared comfortable. Her speech was fluent. She appeared calm and unworried about her upcoming procedures. Her thought process was linear. She denied paranoia, hallucinations, or suicidality. Attention and both recent and remote memory were intact. She acknowledged that it had been difficult living with Crohn’s disease, but she was optimistic that her symptoms would improve. She denied depressive symptoms. She looked sad at the beginning of the interview, but she appeared more engaged and euthymic the more she talked. She could not explain why the team was unable to locate her doctor and became irritated when the medical student pressed more specifically to elicit further details about her prior care. She was taken to have an endoscopy and a colonoscopy at the end of the interview.

Ms. Ehrlich’s endoscopy and colonoscopy results were normal. That evening, the medical student from psychiatry sat in with the GI team as they reviewed the normal results with the patient. She said she was relieved there was no longer anything seriously wrong with her. The GI team told her that she could be discharged the next morning and that she should have her internist call them. She readily agreed.

After the GI team left, Ms. Ehrlich told the student that she was “feeling better already.” She quickly removed her own intravenous line and started to get dressed. The student went to get the primary GI team. When they returned, the patient was gone.

The medical student spent much of the next day calling hospitals and physicians that met descriptions provided by the patient and her mother. That afternoon, one of the physicians called back and indicated that he had treated Ms. Ehrlich 6 months earlier at a hospital near her mother’s home. That admission was strikingly similar: after a short hospitalization, she quickly fled from the hospital after a normal colonoscopy.","Factitious disorder, recurrent episodes",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Analyzing probable diagnoses**

I need to create a structured list of top psychiatric diagnoses based on DSM-5-TR. The instructions don't exclude ""rule out,"" so I can definitely consider different possibilities. That said, I have to highlight the top five likely diagnoses. 

For example, I’m weighing ""Somatic symptom disorder"" against ""factitious disorder,"" noting that factitious requires intentional deception, which isn’t clearly evident. The patient's symptoms suggest exaggeration, even though they have a medical history with Crohn's disease and normal test results.

**Evaluating potential diagnoses**

I'm considering various conditions for the patient. First, could it be ""functional abdominal pain syndrome""? That one isn't classified as F-coded but has medical implications. Other possibilities like ""opioid use disorder"" or ""panic disorder"" don’t fit. 

There’s also ""depressive disorder due to another medical condition,"" but it's not applicable. I wonder about ""Avoidant personality disorder"" since she used to have friends. Eventually, I identify ""factitious disorder"" as the strongest possibility and look towards diagnoses like somatic symptom disorder and adjustment disorder for differentials.

**Choosing relevant diagnoses**

I’m thinking the second possibility could be ""Somatic symptom disorder with predominant pain"" since she experiences severe abdominal pain that disrupts her life. However, she may not have excessive thoughts, but I wonder if it fits. 

Another option is ""Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions,"" but that seems less appropriate. Exploring ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressed mood"" due to her chronic illness feels right, even if she denies it. Including ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" is possible too, but ultimately I want to focus on the current evidence rather than past issues.

**Assessing current conditions**

I want to look at the patient's history regarding vulnerability and anxiety. She had therapy in college for test-taking and career-choice anxiety, using CBT, but it's resolved with no recurrence, which means she doesn't have a current anxiety disorder.

I must base my choices on the information I have, avoiding any assumptions. ""Somatic symptom disorder"" and ""Illness anxiety disorder"" could be viable differential diagnoses, along with ""Adjustment disorder."" I'm also considering ""Major depressive disorder,"" but since she denies symptoms like depressed mood or anhedonia, I’m unsure about it.

**Finalizing potential diagnoses**

I want to consider ""Depressive disorder due to another medical condition"" or ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" since she looked sad, and the consultation was called after staff noted her difficulties. Although she denies feeling sad, it’s worth exploring. 

We have options like ""Adjustment disorder"" and ""Somatic symptom disorder"" to include. Factitious disorder is also in the mix. I’m weighing everything carefully, ensuring all codes align accurately with diagnoses. 

Ultimately, I’ll finalize the top five likely diagnoses from factitious to adjustment disorders, noting their relevance even if not all criteria are fully met.

**Structuring diagnoses**

I’m weighing the evidence to finalize the diagnoses. While she showed initial sadness and social isolation, she engaged later and denies depression. So I think ""Adjustment Disorder"" should be secondary rather than a depressive disorder. 

For the fifth diagnosis, I might go with ""Unspecified personality disorder"" or lean towards ""Factitious disorder imposed on self"" as primary due to the deceptive pattern. 

Ultimately, I’ll structure the top five with focus to make sure they're the most plausible options based on her presentation.

**Finalizing diagnoses**

I’m formalizing the list of diagnoses and ensuring the formatting is precise for clarity. My primary is ""Factitious disorder imposed on self, recurrent episodes - F68.10"". Then I have ""Somatic symptom disorder, with predominant pain - F45.1"", ""Illness anxiety disorder - F45.21"", ""Adjustment disorder with depressed mood - F43.21"", and ""Personality disorder, unspecified - F60.9"".

141,"Thomas, an 8-year-old boy with a mild to moderate intellectual developmental disorder, was brought into the emergency room (ER) by his parents after his abdominal pain of the past several weeks had worsened over the prior 24 hours. His parents reported that he had developed constipation, with only one bowel movement in the past week, and that he had vomited earlier in the day. Teachers at his special education classroom for children with intellectual developmental disorders had written a report earlier in the week indicating that Thomas had been having difficulties since soon after transferring from a similar school in a different state about 4 months earlier. The teachers and parents agreed that Thomas often looked distressed, rocking, crying, and clutching his stomach.

One week earlier, a pediatrician had diagnosed an acute exacerbation of chronic constipation. Use of a recommended over-the-counter laxative was not helpful, and Thomas began to complain of nighttime pain. The discomfort led to a diminished interest in his favorite hobbies, which were video games and sports. Instead, he tended to stay in his room, playing with army men figurines that he had inherited from his grandfather’s collection. Aside from episodes of irritability and tearfulness, he was generally doing well in school, both in the classroom and on the playground. When not complaining of stomachaches, Thomas ate well and maintained his position at about the 40th percentile for height and weight on the growth curve.

Thomas’s past medical history was significant for constipation and stomachaches, as well as for intermittent headaches. All of these symptoms had worsened several months earlier, after the family moved from a house in semirural Florida into an old walk-up apartment in a large urban city in a different state. He shared a room with his younger brother (age 6 years), the product of a normal, unexpected pregnancy, who was enrolled in a regular education class at the local public school. Thomas said his brother was his “best friend.” Thomas was adopted at birth, and nothing was known of his biological parents except that they were teenagers unable to care for the child.

On medical examination in the ER, Thomas was a well-groomed boy sitting on his mother’s lap. He was crying and irritable and refused to speak to the examiner. Instead, he would repeat to his parents that his stomach hurt. On physical examination, he was afebrile and had stable vital signs. His physical examination was remarkable only for general abdominal tenderness, although he was difficult to assess because he cried uncontrollably through most of the exam.

An abdominal X ray revealed multiple small metallic particles throughout the gastrointestinal tract, initially suspected to be ingested high-lead paint flakes, as well as three 2-centimeter-long metallic objects in his stomach. A blood lead level was 20 μg/dL (whereas normal level for children is < 5 μg/dL). More specific questioning revealed that Thomas, being constipated, often spent long stretches on the toilet by himself. His parents added that although the bathroom was in the process of being renovated, its paint was old and peeling. Consultants decided that the larger foreign bodies in the stomach might not safely pass and could be accounting for the constipation. Endoscopy successfully extricated three antique toy soldiers from Thomas’s stomach.","1. Pica
2. Intellectual developmental disorder, mild to moderate",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Evaluating psychiatric diagnoses**

In this task, I need to provide a structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses, focusing on actual diagnoses rather than differential ones, while also keeping in mind the top five likely options. The primary diagnosis is pica, with secondary being intellectual developmental disorder, followed by autism spectrum disorder, adjustment disorder, and somatic symptom disorder. I should re-examine the case to ensure the selected diagnoses are plausible, taking into account the child's characteristics and social interactions.

**Assessing potential diagnoses**

I'm considering the behavior of the child, who refused to speak to the examiner but repeated things to his parents. This could suggest situational anxiety or pain. The rocking behavior indicates distress, which isn't typical of autism, though pica is common in both autism and intellectual disabilities. I'm also exploring anxiety disorders and adjustment disorder since he displayed difficulties after moving. Symptoms like tearfulness and irritability seem reactive to pain rather than indicative of a separate mental health issue.

**Clarifying adjustment disorder diagnoses**

I’m thinking about how we could classify the child’s situation, considering ""Adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct,"" but there's no conduct issue here. I lean towards “Adjustment disorder with anxiety” since he has clear distress from the life stressor of moving and changing schools. DSM-5 criteria require emotional symptoms in response to identifiable stressors within three months, but his symptoms like abdominal pain and headaches seem tied to lead ingestion rather than just anxiety.

**Analyzing emotional symptoms**

I’m examining the child’s emotional symptoms like distress, irritability, and tearfulness. It's challenging because pica is a clear mental disorder that could explain his behavior and distress issues. While adjustment disorder might be considered, it seems likely that his symptoms stem more from pica and associated physical issues. I’m also looking at other possibilities, like stereotypic movement disorder or unspecified anxiety disorder, but none of those seem to fit well. For documentation, I’d list pica and intellectual developmental disorder, potentially considering other neurodevelopmental disorders.

**Determining psychiatric diagnoses**

I need to decide on the top five psychiatric diagnoses for this child. I’m considering pica as the primary disorder, particularly since ingestion of objects seems to suggest this. I also want to include intellectual developmental disorder, possibly unspecified severity, alongside adjustment disorder with anxiety and unspecified anxiety disorder. Stereotypic movement disorder could be another possibility, but I’m unsure if it fits more than the others. The child’s ingestion patterns and related symptoms point towards pica being the key issue here.

**Finalizing psychiatric diagnoses**

I need to finalize a structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses. The primary diagnosis will be pica (F98.3). For the second, I’ll list Intellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder), unspecified severity (F79). Next, I’ll consider Stereotypic Movement Disorder (F98.4), since rocking has been observed. Then I want to include Adjustment Disorder with anxiety (F43.22) due to his recent move. Lastly, I’ll pick Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9) or possibly Unspecified Depressive Disorder (F32.A) based on various symptoms like irritability and tearfulness.

**Finalizing psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm focusing on creating a structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses. The primary diagnosis will be pica (F98.3), and I’ll follow it with Intellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder), unspecified severity (F79). Next, I’ll include Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood (F43.23) due to the recent move. For the fourth, I’m leaning toward Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9) or Unspecified Depressive Disorder (F32.A), given his distress. Lastly, I might consider Stereotypic Movement Disorder (F98.4) because of his observed rocking behavior.

**Deciding on diagnoses**

I'm finalizing the list of potential diagnoses. The primary diagnosis will definitely be pica (F98.3), followed by Intellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder), unspecified severity (F79). For the third slot, I’m going with Stereotypic Movement Disorder (F98.4) because of the observed body rocking behavior. Fourth, I’ll include Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood (F43.23) to address emotional symptoms due to recent changes. Lastly, I’ll pick Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9) since he shows distress. This gives a clear and plausible five-diagnosis list!

**Finalizing diagnoses**

I’m working through the final diagnoses list. I know pica (F98.3) is primary, followed by Intellectual Disability (F79). For the third item, I’m including Stereotypic Movement Disorder (F98.4) because of the observed rocking behavior. The fourth position will likely go to Adjustment Disorder with anxiety (F43.22), considering the stress from moving. Lastly, I’ll choose Unspecified Depressive Disorder (F32.A) given the diminished interest and social withdrawal. This gives me a comprehensive, plausible list of diagnoses!

**Evaluating diagnosis options**

I’m reflecting on the potential diagnoses for this case. Pica (F98.3) is essential, followed by Intellectual Disability (F79). I’m considering Stereotypic Movement Disorder (F98.4) as well. For the fourth diagnosis, an Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood (F43.23) seems suitable. Lastly, I’m leaning towards including Autism Spectrum Disorder (F84.0) as the fifth option due to the presence of stereotyped movements and some communication difficulties, though I wonder about the implications of that choice. It feels plausible in this context!

**Revising diagnosis considerations**

I’m analyzing the symptoms to determine if Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) could be a fit, but it feels like there isn’t enough evidence. I’m also considering other options like obsessive-compulsive behaviors or unspecified feeding disorders, though those might not be appropriate either. For the final list, I think Pica (F98.3) and Intellectual Disability (F79) should stay as priorities. I could list Stereotypic Movement Disorder (F98.4), Adjustment Disorder with anxiety (F43.22), and possibly Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9) instead of ASD. This way, I ensure the diagnoses align closely with observed symptoms.

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

I’m evaluating the best diagnoses based on the symptoms, starting with Pica (F98.3) and Intellectual Disability (F79) since they're established. For the next entries, I’m considering Stereotypic Movement Disorder (F98.4) and Adjustment Disorder (F43.20). I played around with the idea of including unspecified anxiety or depressive disorders, but they might not fit due to insufficient evidence. Instead, I could focus on ""Other specified neurodevelopmental disorder"" (F88) as a potential catch-all for any overlapping issues. Ultimately, I want to ensure I’m making accurate and justifiable choices.

**Finalizing diagnostic list**

I’m working on the top 5 diagnoses for the case, starting with Pica and Intellectual Disability given their certainty. Next, I considered Stereotypic Movement Disorder and Adjustment Disorder with anxiety. Including Autism Spectrum Disorder felt a bit uncertain—there's not enough evidence for that one. Instead, I’m leaning towards Unspecified Anxiety Disorder as a plausible option. It’ll give us a balanced list while addressing the symptoms. I’ll make sure to verify the F-codes to ensure accuracy!

**Confirming F-code list**

I'm verifying the F-codes for the diagnoses. Here’s the finalized list based on the required formatting:

142,"Uma, an 11-year-old girl in a gifted and talented school, was referred to an eating disorder specialist by a child psychiatrist who was concerned that Uma had drifted below the 10th percentile for weight. The psychiatrist had been treating Uma for perfectionistic traits that caused her significant anxiety. Their sessions focused on anxiety, not on eating behavior.

Uma’s eating difficulties started at age 9, when she began refusing to eat and reporting a fear that she would vomit. At that time, her parents sought treatment from a pediatrician, who continued to evaluate her yearly, explaining that it was normal for children to go through phases. At age 9, Uma was above the 25th percentile for both height and weight (52 inches, 58 pounds), but by age 11, she had essentially stopped growing and had dropped to the 5th percentile on her growth curves (52.5 inches, 55 pounds).

The only child of two professional parents who had divorced 5 years earlier, Uma lived with her mother on weekdays and with her nearby father on weekends. Her medical history was significant for her premature birth at 34 weeks’ gestation. She was slow to achieve her initial milestones but by age 2 was developmentally normal. Yearly physical examinations had been unremarkable with the exception of the recent decline of her growth trajectory. Uma had always been petite, but her height and weight had never fallen below the 25th percentile for stature and weight for age on the growth chart. Uma was a talented student who was well liked by her teachers. She had never had more than a few friends, but recently she had stopped socializing entirely and had been coming directly home after school, reporting that her stomach felt calmer when she was in her own home.

For the prior 2 years, Uma had eaten only very small amounts of food over very long durations of time. Her parents had tried to pique her interest by experimenting with foods from different cultures and of different colors and textures. None of this seemed effective in improving her appetite. They also tried to let her pick restaurants to try, but Uma had gradually refused to eat outside of either parent’s home. Both parents reported a similar mealtime pattern: Uma would agree to sit at the table but then spent her time rearranging food on her plate, cutting food items into small pieces, and crying if urged to eat another bite.

When asked more about her fear of vomiting, Uma remembered one incident, at age 4, when she ate soup and her stomach became upset and then she subsequently vomited. More recently, Uma had developed fear of eating in public and ate no food during the school day. She denied any concerns about her appearance and said that she had first become aware of her low weight at her most recent visit to the pediatrician. When educated about the dangers of low body weight, Uma became tearful and expressed a clear desire to gain weight.",Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder,dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Ranking anxiety disorders**

I'm trying to determine the top 5 anxiety-related disorders based on likelihood. First, there's ARFID, which is clear. Then, I think about specific phobia related to vomiting, followed by social anxiety disorder due to fear of eating in public. Generalized anxiety disorder comes next, mostly about perfectionism. Obsessive-compulsive disorder could also fit in because of ritualistic mealtime behaviors. It's interesting that both GAD and social anxiety could coexist, but we have to be careful about how ARFID interacts with these. I wonder if viewing it as ARFID plus specific phobia might make more sense.

**Considering anxiety disorders**

I'm weighing the options for listing anxiety disorders. Instead of separating phobias, I could include ""Other specified anxiety disorder."" The rankings I'm considering are as follows: ARFID at number one, then specific phobia related to vomiting, followed by social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and finally obsessive-compulsive disorder. I need to find evidence for OCD or consider alternatives like ""Other specified obsessive-compulsive disorder."" Personality disorders usually apply to adults, but there can be considerations for younger individuals if criteria are met. Perfectionism alone isn't enough to diagnose, though.

**Determining plausible diagnoses**

I'm considering whether to keep OCD as a more plausible option compared to OCPD. However, perfectionistic traits could indicate OCPD or general anxiety instead of OCD. Since we lack evidence for OCD, I wonder about including ""Unspecified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder."" Alternatively, I could consider ""Unspecified depressive disorder,"" which relates to depression but isn’t F-coded. There’s also the idea of including ""Anorexia nervosa, restricting type,"" but she denies issues with body image. I’m trying to ensure we provide exactly five diagnoses!

**Evaluating likely diagnoses**

I'm considering whether to include ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" instead of GAD if I'm uncertain. It's essential to present just the top five most plausible diagnoses based on the provided information without fabricating details. First, ARFID seems strong since it meets the criteria with issues like weight failure and fear of vomiting. Then, I look at specific phobia related to vomiting, where she has a persistent fear for two years. This fear leads to avoidance of eating, which fits the criteria for a specific phobia.

**Finalizing diagnoses**

I’m evaluating the most plausible diagnoses based on the information available. It’s possible to include ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" if there’s uncertainty. ARFID seems strong, and the specific phobia about vomiting fits well with food avoidance. Social anxiety disorder also makes sense due to her fear of eating in public. With generalized anxiety disorder, I've seen perfectionism tied to anxiety, but ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" might be more accurate without complete criteria. Finally, I’ll likely list OCD as unspecified since there are perfectionistic traits, but we'll need the top five, including specific codes.

**Listing potential diagnoses**

I've compiled a list of potential diagnoses based on gathered information. We could go with:

1. Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder - F50.82,
2. Specific Phobia, other type (vomiting) - F40.298,
3. Social Anxiety Disorder - F40.10,
4. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder, related to perfectionism - F41.9,
5. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, unspecified - F42.9.

I should ensure that these accurately represent clinically significant symptoms without overstepping what's implied in the vignette. It seems we also have to consider alternatives but aim for a structured, precise presentation of diagnoses.

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

I’m looking to finalize the structured list of psychiatric diagnoses while ensuring I follow the proper format. Here’s what I've settled on:

1. Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder - ICD-10 F50.82
2. Specific Phobia, other type (vomiting) - ICD-10 F40.298
3. Generalized Anxiety Disorder - ICD-10 F41.1
4. Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia) - ICD-10 F40.10
5. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder - ICD-10 F42.9

I need to ensure that these codes fit the criteria laid out, while also accurately reflecting the likely conditions.

**Refining anxiety diagnoses**

I need to finalize the structured list of psychiatric diagnoses. Here's what I've come up with:

1. Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder - F50.82

3. Social Anxiety Disorder - F40.10
4. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder - F41.9
5. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, unspecified - F42.9

This arrangement includes the major concerns while allowing room for broader anxiety-related symptoms. It seems to balance between the specific and unspecified contexts around anxiety without redundancy, which feels like a safer approach.

**Finalizing anxiety diagnoses**

I’ve narrowed down the structured list of diagnoses, focusing on the primary and secondary conditions. Here’s how it looks:

144,"Wanda Hoffman was a 24-year-old woman who was referred to a psychiatrist by her internist. She said she felt sad, worthless, and lonely. She reported that she needed to improve her diet and exercise but felt out of control. She added that she had gone to her internist several times in recent months for stomachaches, and he finally insisted that she see a psychiatrist.

Ms. Hoffman had been living alone since her college graduation 2 years earlier. She had recently been promoted in her job as an accountant, and said that she enjoyed her work. She mentioned having some friends from high school and being interested in dating, but she felt too tired and sad to do much besides meet up for a quick dinner after work. She was unable to exercise because of low energy, slept poorly, and frequently had stomachaches. These symptoms and the resulting social dysfunction had caused her to feel increasingly isolated, lonely, and sad. She often found herself feeling worthless and wondering how she was going to get through the week, but she denied suicidal intent or plan.

She said she had accepted the psychiatric referral so that she could get an antidepressant medication, but “it had to be one that didn’t cause weight gain. Hopefully, I could get one that would cause weight loss, instead.” Ms. Hoffman added that she couldn’t get back to her ideal weight despite lots of effort. When asked about the effort, Ms. Hoffman grew quiet but did eventually answer: “I wasn’t going to talk about this, but I’m a ‘failed anorexic.’ I can diet for about half a day, but by dinner, I’m starving, so I eat everything I can find, and then I throw up. It’s mortifying.”

Ms. Hoffman reported that she had started dieting at about age 13; she noted that, in retrospect, she was “being ridiculous,” and that her weight had been fine. She said her downfall really began when she started “stress eating” in college. When she realized she had gained 10 or 15 pounds, she began to routinely skip breakfast. She often skipped lunch as well, but then, famished, she would overeat in the late afternoon and evening.

By the end of her sophomore year, Ms. Hoffman had started inducing vomiting, a practice she learned about in a magazine. She had developed her current eating pattern during her junior year and continued it after graduation: no breakfast; a “light” lunch; an “average” dinner, often with friends; and then she’d rush back to her apartment for a second dinner and a pint or two of ice cream, followed by self-induced vomiting.","1. Bulimia nervosa
2. Major depressive disorder",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Analyzing psychiatric diagnoses**

The task doesn't explicitly mention a differential list. However, ""building your differential diagnosis"" hints at it while the request for a ""structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses"" indicates final diagnoses. In practical settings, I'd list primary and comorbidities, but for the exam, it seems they want specific examples. I need to ensure I include accurate codes and not non-psychiatric diagnoses without F-codes. I'm considering what diagnoses could plausibly fit.

**Evaluating potential diagnoses**

For insomnia, the user mentioned ""slept poorly"" along with low energy, which suggests it could be a symptom, but it might not meet all criteria. Considering differentials, I might add ""Adjustment disorder with depressed mood"" as an alternative to Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). While MDD is already present, I’m contemplating other options like ""Generalized anxiety disorder,"" which doesn’t fit perfectly. Anorexia binge-eating/purging type doesn't fit either since the user isn't underweight. I need to consider what secondary diagnoses might be plausible based on the details provided.

**Assessing depressive symptoms**

The user appears to have a depressed mood, low energy, insomnia, feelings of worthlessness, and social withdrawal, which could point to Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). They deny suicidal ideation, but still enjoy work despite fatigue. There's a chance her depression could be secondary to bulimia, but MDD stands out. Regarding somatic symptoms, her stomachaches might relate to vomiting, yet they haven't been evaluated as psychiatric. Since she’s primarily focused on depression and weight, this could suggest that bulimia is present alongside major depression.

**Listing possible diagnoses**

I need to identify five diagnoses for the case. I can consider options like ""Other specified feeding or eating disorder,"" ""Anorexia nervosa, binge-eating/purging type,"" and ""Binge-eating disorder."" MDD is also a possibility. I think listing Bulimia nervosa and Major Depressive Disorder would work, along with ""Other specified feeding or eating disorder (atypical anorexia nervosa)."" However, she started dieting young, which complicates things. I might also think about ""unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder,"" but need criteria clarification. I want to ensure I cover all potential conditions accurately.

**Finalizing diagnostic list**

I need to provide five likely diagnoses based on the information. The first two are clear: Bulimia nervosa and Major Depressive Disorder. For the third, I can consider ""Other specified feeding or eating disorder,"" as it seems to fit given her symptoms. I might also think about including ""Somatic symptom disorder"" due to her stomachaches from the vomiting. The last two can be ""Persistent depressive disorder"" and ""Adjustment disorder."" So, I’ll finalize that structured list of five with appropriate F-codes. Let's craft it!

**Determining diagnoses**

I need to narrow down the top five likely diagnoses based on her symptoms. Bulimia nervosa is primary due to her concerns. Major depressive disorder seems plausible since she shows signs of depressed mood, low energy, and worthlessness. There’s also a possibility for ""Other specified feeding or eating disorder,"" including purging types. I’m considering ""Somatic symptom disorder"" due to her stomachaches, and perhaps ""Adjustment disorder with depressed mood."" I'll finalize the list with appropriate F-codes to match each diagnosis!

**Selecting diagnoses**

I’m refining the list of potential diagnoses. Bulimia nervosa remains a clear choice, and major depressive disorder is plausible due to her symptoms. I could go with ""Other specified feeding or eating disorder,"" specifically for purging types. Somatic symptom disorder is also in the mix due to her stomachaches, while adjustment disorder might be less relevant since her situation has persisted for a while. So, I’ll finalize the five with their respective ICD-10 codes as required.

**Refining diagnosis list**

I'm narrowing down the likely diagnoses here. Bulimia and major depressive disorder are strong considerations. ""Other specified feeding or eating disorder"" might apply if bulimia criteria aren't fully met, but I should weigh in somatic symptom disorder due to stomachaches. Adjustments might work due to stress, but I'm unsure about clear stressors. Ultimately, I should stick to five robust options, ensuring I don't include unsupported or speculative diagnoses. So, I'll finalize my diagnoses based on the provided information to create a structured list.

**Finalizing diagnosis hierarchy**

I'm working on establishing a list of top diagnoses based on the case. Usually, I’d list a primary and comorbid conditions, but here, I should treat it as a differential. This means I'll prioritize the most likely diagnoses, such as bulimia nervosa and major depressive disorder. I will also consider including other specified feeding disorders and insomnia, while evaluating if conditions like somatic symptom disorder fit. Ultimately, I need to ensure this list is plausible and follows the user's request for a structured format.

**Refining differential diagnoses**

I'm reviewing the case and need to refine the top five psychiatric diagnoses based on symptoms provided. She mentioned gaining weight, but that doesn’t rule out anorexia, especially if she was previously underweight. Major depressive disorder is strong, considering her feelings of worthlessness and isolation. I’m including bulimia nervosa and possibly insomnia or somatic symptom disorder for diverse considerations. For clarity, I'll finalize the list with specific conditions and their ICD-10 codes, ensuring all aspects of her situation are considered.

**Finalizing differential diagnoses**

I'm evaluating the possible psychiatric diagnoses based on the case. While she mentions gaining weight, it doesn't imply she is underweight. Given her symptoms, I'm leaning toward bulimia nervosa as the primary diagnosis, followed by major depressive disorder. Insomnia, somatic symptom disorder, and other specified feeding disorders are possible secondary diagnoses. I need to ensure accurate ICD-10 codes for each condition while confirming that they fit the symptom criteria. Here’s my final list of top diagnoses with their respective F-codes.

**Listing final diagnoses**

I’m identifying the top psychiatric diagnoses for the case, ensuring to follow the structured format required. After evaluating symptoms and potential conditions, the following five seem most relevant:

1. Bulimia nervosa - F50.2  
2. Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified - F32.9  
3. Other specified feeding or eating disorder - F50.89  
4. Anorexia nervosa, binge-eating/purging type - F50.02  
5. Somatic symptom disorder - F45.1  

This aligns with the user's request to present the diagnoses without including any clinical reasoning.

**Finalizing diagnoses list**

I’m considering the most plausible diagnoses for this case and noting that anorexia seems less likely. It might be better to think about including ""Other specified feeding or eating disorder"" instead. I need to ensure I present a clear list without redundancies. Given the stomachaches—likely linked to bulimia—I must confirm that I use accurate ICD-10 codes:

1. Bulimia nervosa - F50.2  
2. Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified - F32.9

145,"Yasmine Isherwood, a 55-year-old married woman, had been in psychiatric treatment for 6 months for an episode of major depressive disorder. She had responded well to a combination of psychotherapy and medications (fluoxetine and bupropion), but she began to complain of weight gain. She was at her “highest weight ever,” which was 140 pounds (her height was 5 feet 5 inches, so her BMI was 23.3).

The psychiatrist embarked on a clarification of Ms. Isherwood’s eating history, which was marked by recurrent, distressing episodes of uncontrollable eating of large amounts of food. The overeating was not new but seemed to have worsened while she was taking antidepressants. She reported that she often worked late in her job as marketing director for a large software company, and that the eating episodes often occurred on one of 2 days per week that she happened to get home before her husband, a cardiologist at a local hospital. These “eating jags” were notable for a sense that she was out of control. She ate rapidly and alone, until uncomfortably full. She would then feel depressed, tired, and disgusted with herself. She usually binged on healthy food but also had “sugar binges” where she ate primarily sweets, especially ice cream and candy. She denied current or past self-induced vomiting, fasting, or misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or weight-loss agents. She reported exercising for an hour almost every day but denied being “addicted” to it. She did report that in her late 20s, she had become a competitive runner. At that time, she ran an average of about 35 miles per week, despite a lingering foot injury that eventually forced her to shift to swimming, biking, and the elliptical machine.

Ms. Isherwood stated that she had binged on food “for as long as I can remember.” She was “chunky” as a child but stayed at a normal weight throughout high school (120–125 pounds) because she was so active. She denied a history of anorexia nervosa. At age 28, when she was competitively running, she reached her lowest adult weight of 113 pounds. At that point, she felt “vital, healthy, and in control.”

In her mid-30s, she had a major depressive episode that lasted 2 years. She had a severely depressed mood, did not talk, “closed down,” stayed in bed, was very fatigued, slept more than usual, and was unable to function. This was one of the few times in her life that the binge eating stopped and she lost weight. She denied a history of hypomanic or manic episodes. Although she lived with frequent sadness, she denied other serious depressive episodes until the past year. She denied a history of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and any significant use of alcohol, tobacco, or illicit substances.

The evaluation revealed a well-nourished, well-developed female who was coherent and cooperative. Her speech was fluent and not pressured. She had a mildly depressed mood but had a reactive affect with appropriate smiles. She denied guilt, suicidality, and hopelessness. She said her energy was normal except for post-binge fatigue. She denied psychosis and confusion. Her cognition was normal. Her medical history was unremarkable, and physical examination and basic laboratory test results provided by her internist were within normal limits.","1. Binge-eating disorder, mild
2. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, in remission",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Analyzing potential conditions**

I'm thinking about the top five most likely conditions related to the case. I’ll consider BED, MDD, PDD, and maybe something like ""Other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder"" which could involve compulsive exercise, although it’s not typical. I’m also considering ""Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder"" due to traits like perfectionism and control related to exercise. Finally, I might think about ""Anorexia nervosa, restricting type, in remission,"" but she denies that diagnosis. There are definitely a lot of factors to weigh!

**Organizing potential diagnoses**

I'm considering ""Adjustment disorder with depressed mood"" because of weight gain, but since she has MDD, that won’t work. An ""Other specified or unspecified feeding or eating disorder"" could potentially fit. I also briefly thought about ""Obsessive-compulsive disorder"" due to repetitive behaviors, but that may not apply either. I realize I might need to include some less supported diagnoses to meet the requirement of listing five. The instructions emphasize presenting these as a structured list while following clinical guidelines.

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

I need to focus on producing the final list of diagnoses without the reasoning. Each code should align with ICD-10 F codes. For Binge-eating disorder, it’s F50.81, and for MDD in recurrent, partial remission, it’s F33.41. For PDD, I’ll use F34.1. 

Now for the last two, maybe I’ll go with ""Other specified feeding or eating disorder"" as F50.89 and ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" as F32.A, but I’ll keep in mind that some codes might vary by region. I think it's acceptable to include F32.A for the output.

**Deciding on potential diagnoses**

I'm considering the modern ICD-10-CM codes, which include letters after the decimal. For unspecified depressive disorder, I can go with F32.A, but for Major Depressive Disorder, F32.9 would be for a single episode, yet she has recurrent. 

For feeding disorders, F50.89 suits ""Other specified feeding or eating disorder"" and F50.9 for ""Unspecified feeding or eating disorder,"" though if she has BED, OSFED might be less likely. Bulimia nervosa, while a potential option, seems less likely without compensatory behaviors. I’ll need to rank these options carefully!

**Determining the most likely diagnoses**

I’m weighing whether OSFED is more likely than bulimia. Since she might meet criteria for BED, that impacts the diagnosis choice. While I've considered bulimia, it requires specific behaviors, and she denies them. Binge-eating disorder seems classic given her history and distress. I’ll include Major Depressive Disorder as comorbid, alongside other likely diagnoses. Although listing both OSFED and Bulimia could feel redundant, I think we want to focus on specifying the most probable five. I'll ensure the codes align correctly for the final output!

**Listing potential diagnoses**

I'm outlining the potential diagnoses: Binge-eating disorder (F50.81), Major depressive disorder, recurrent (F33.41), Persistent depressive disorder (F34.1), and possibly Bulimia nervosa (F50.2). I also have to consider ""Other specified feeding or eating disorder"" (F50.89) or ""Unspecified feeding or eating disorder"" (F50.9). Given her past major depressive episodes, it seems likely MDD is a factor, and I need to pick the most plausible diagnoses to meet the requirement for a top five list while making sure the codes align correctly!

**Deciding on top diagnoses**

I'm looking at possible diagnoses and weighing whether to include “Unspecified feeding or eating disorder” since it may be less specific. If there's enough evidence, I might rank bulimia higher. For my top five list, I’m considering: Binge-eating disorder (F50.81), Major depressive disorder (F33.41), Persistent depressive disorder (F34.1), Bulimia nervosa (F50.2), and then possibly Other specified feeding or eating disorder (F50.89). I also need to ensure I’m using the correct DSM-5-TR names and codes while also being clear and concise!

**Finalizing possible diagnoses**

I'm assessing the situation and realizing we lack details on symptoms like appetite, sleep, and energy levels, making it hard to confirm certain conditions. For the top five diagnoses, I’m considering including Binge-eating Disorder (BED), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in partial remission, Unspecified Depressive Disorder for chronic symptoms, Bulimia Nervosa as a rule-out, and Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder. I also need to ensure I use the right DSM-5-TR codes while keeping the list concise and relevant!

**Assessing possible diagnoses**

I'm evaluating the best diagnoses and leaning towards Binge-eating Disorder (BED), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in partial remission, Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD), Bulimia Nervosa, and Unspecified Feeding or Eating Disorder. I find PDD might not fit perfectly due to insufficient details about chronic depressed mood, suggesting that ""Other Specified Depressive Disorder"" could be a better option. I need to ensure I'm clear on the codes: F50.81 for BED, F33.41 for MDD, and so on, while maintaining a focused list!

**Finalizing diagnoses list**

I'm focusing on the best diagnoses for this case. I've strongly supported Binge-eating Disorder (F50.81) and Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in partial remission (F33.41). For the third option, I'm considering Persistent Depressive Disorder (F34.1) but may need to adjust it to Other Specified Depressive Disorder (F32.8) if PDD isn't backed up by enough information. I'm also including Bulimia Nervosa (F50.2) and Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (F50.89). It seems like a solid list!","1. Binge-eating disorder - F50.81

146,"Zack was an 8-year-old boy brought to the outpatient child psychiatry clinic by his mother because of increasing tantrums and somatic complaints without an apparent cause. The mother reported that the symptoms appeared related to the nights that he spent with his aunt, another single mom with a boy similar in age to Zack. He had been close to this aunt since birth but had only recently begun to spend every Friday night with her when the mother took on a night shift at work.

For 2 months prior to the consultation, Zack would report nausea and headaches on Fridays and complain that his aunt’s house was “creepy.” He continued to visit, with reluctance, although he did once call his mother at work demanding that she pick him up, saying, “Other kids live in their own home every day of the week.”

In recent weeks, Zack screamed and hid when it came time to go to his aunt’s home. His mother became concerned that something could have “happened” to Zack during a visit. The mother struggled to reconcile this with the fact that Zack had no objections to seeing the aunt and cousin anywhere else, and he had no objection to the cousin sleeping at their home. Her sister had always been “a good mom” and was always home during the sleepovers. She did have a boyfriend, but Zack seemed to like him. In fact, Zack seemed especially excited to go to the park or ball games with his cousin and the boyfriend.

Zack had never previously had particularly significant separation, behavioral, or emotional issues. He achieved all developmental milestones on time. He had never seen a doctor aside from routine visits and one bad cold when he was age 3. Zack had yet to achieve consistent overnight continence, however, and did wet the bed approximately twice weekly. He had no daytime voiding symptoms or constipation. The pediatrician had told them that this was “normal” at Zack’s age. The mother had never made a big deal about the bed-wetting, and Zack had never expressed significant distress about it.

Family history was negative for all psychiatric illness on the mother’s side, and the mother said her own developmental landmarks were normal as far as she had been told. The mother knew little about Zack’s father’s developmental or family history, and she had not seen him since before Zack was born.

On mental status examination, Zack was cooperative and appeared well nourished and well cared for. He had little difficulty separating from his mother. After an initial period of warming up to the interviewer, his speech was spontaneous with a vocabulary appropriate for his age. He maintained age-appropriate eye contact. His affect was initially mildly anxious, but he rapidly calmed. Anxiety only reappeared upon discussing his sleepovers, when Zack demonstrated some fidgeting, decreased eye contact, and mild irritability directed toward his mother. When asked about the bed-wetting, Zack appeared embarrassed. He said he had wet the bed at his aunt’s house a few times and that both his cousin and his aunt’s boyfriend teased him about it. His aunt had intervened, but he described being “scared” that he would do it again.","Enuresis, nocturnal only",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Evaluating anxiety diagnosis**

I’m exploring separation anxiety as a potential diagnosis because it seems tied to a fear of being away from home. The user mentioned that the child feels this way compared to other kids. There's also the specific fear of the aunt's house, but for it to be a phobia, there must be immediate fear present. The DSM-5 requires at least six months for phobias, so that’s a consideration too. However, I might still suggest ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" given the limited symptom duration.

**Analyzing potential disorders**

I'm considering social anxiety disorder since it involves significant fear of scrutiny in social situations, specifically noted with the child's fear of teasing by a cousin and an adult boyfriend. However, this isn't his only issue. I also looked at oppositional defiant disorder but realized the criteria require a longer duration. Somatic symptom disorder doesn't match either. Given his ongoing bedwetting and accompanying tantrums, I might lean towards either Adjustment disorder with anxiety or Separation anxiety disorder as primary diagnoses.

**Analyzing bedwetting and anxiety**

I’m examining the situation with this 8-year-old who has chronic bedwetting, which predates the recent sleepovers. It seems like the symptoms began about two months before his consult. He's experiencing nausea and headaches specifically on Fridays, and it appears that he feels uncomfortable at his aunt's house but doesn't mind seeing them elsewhere. This points to a fear of being there overnight rather than a general fear of his aunt or cousin. The mental state exam shows he gets anxious discussing sleepovers, feeling embarrassed about his bedwetting, particularly since he was teased for it.

**Examining anxiety diagnosis options**

The child's anxiety seems tied to bedwetting and the resulting teasing, which might fit into an ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety."" The stressors are both the teasing and the new overnight stays. Symptoms like anxiety, tantrums, and somatic complaints have been present for less than three months. However, if the child meets the full criteria for separation anxiety, then adjustment disorder wouldn't apply. So, I need to evaluate if he meets those full criteria carefully according to the DSM-5-TR.

**Evaluating anxiety and adjustment disorders**

I’m sorting through the symptoms to determine if this child has separation anxiety. There’s distress about going to his aunt’s, physical symptoms like nausea and headaches, and he's refusing sleepovers due to fear of teasing and bedwetting. Although some signs point toward separation anxiety, his underlying worry centers on embarrassment. It seems more fitting to categorize this as ""Adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct"" due to the tantrums and emotional response, while also considering options like ""Other specified anxiety disorder."" I feel choosing Adjustment disorder may address everything.

**Determining the primary diagnosis**

I’m weighing potential diagnoses and currently leaning towards ""Separation anxiety disorder,"" which could be related to fears of embarrassment due to bedwetting. However, it may be more accurate to suggest that ""Enuresis"" is the primary issue, causing avoidance behaviors. His fear of teasing specifically ties to the context of sleepovers rather than separation itself. Another option is ""Other specified anxiety disorder."" I need to finalize a list of five potential diagnoses with their corresponding ICD-10 codes, focusing on the most relevant information.

**Analyzing diagnosis possibilities**

I'm considering the core issues here, mainly bedwetting and related embarrassment. ""Nocturnal enuresis"" might lead to anxiety, which could suggest an ""Adjustment disorder."" However, the reluctance is rooted in fear of embarrassment rather than actual separation, making ""Separation anxiety disorder"" less likely despite meeting some criteria. I’m weighing options like ""Specific phobia"" tied to sleepovers due to teasing. Ultimately, my top diagnoses list will include options like ""Social anxiety disorder"" and ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" to capture the context accurately.

**Deciding on the primary diagnosis**

I'm exploring various diagnoses for the situation, considering ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" for sleepover-related anxiety due to fear of enuresis. It feels more accurate than ""Separation anxiety disorder,"" which is rooted in fear of humiliation, not separation itself. Observations reveal he shows signs of distress specifically related to sleepovers, and teasing about bedwetting aggravates this. ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety"" might fit better, as it accounts for the distress related to his new stressors. But I still need to weigh all criteria carefully before committing to a primary diagnosis.

**Analyzing the primary diagnosis**

The main issue at hand seems to be not just separation but the fear of bedwetting. While he would prefer to sleep at home due to less humiliation, the focus seems to be on avoiding embarrassment rather than just separation. We might lean toward ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety"" as a primary diagnosis, given the influence of teasing about enuresis. ""Enuresis"" could also factor in, along with possible alternatives like separation anxiety disorder and other specified anxiety disorders. It's tricky, but ultimately, I want to categorize these thoughtfully.

**Structuring the diagnoses**

The main issue at hand involves tantrums and somatic complaints, with enuresis being a significant underlying concern. Diagnosing might lead us to choose enuresis as primary, considering the anxiety is secondary to teasing. His anxiety seems situational rather than indicative of a standalone disorder.

I think the best primary diagnosis is ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety"" due to the stress from teasing about bedwetting. I’ll need to provide F-codes for enuresis, separation anxiety, and other specified anxiety, while ensuring I select the top 5 diagnoses clearly and concisely.

**Identifying the primary diagnoses**

The child is experiencing bedwetting at night, leading to embarrassment and anxiety, particularly about sleepovers. His physical symptoms and avoidance behavior suggest an underlying adjustment reaction rather than separation anxiety. Given the identifiable stressor of teasing, I think ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety"" should be the primary diagnosis. 

In terms of secondary diagnoses, I can include ""Enuresis,"" ""Separation anxiety disorder,"" ""Other specified anxiety disorder,"" and ""Specific phobia situational."" Let's make sure I have the correct F-codes for these diagnoses!

**Choosing the top 5 diagnoses**

I need to focus on listing the top 5 diagnoses without reasoning. Given the case details, I’m leaning towards ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety"" as a primary diagnosis because of the child's identifiable stressor of teasing related to enuresis. 

For the secondary diagnoses, I’ll include ""Enuresis, nocturnal only,"" ""Separation anxiety disorder,"" ""Other specified anxiety disorder,"" and perhaps ""Specific phobia, situational type."" It’s essential that the selected diagnoses align without conflicting criteria. Let's clearly list them out!

**Deciding on primary diagnoses**

I’m outlining the potential diagnoses, considering how to rank them. Enuresis (F98.0) could be primary due to its ongoing nature, but I wonder if ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety"" (F43.22) might be more fitting since it addresses the stress of teasing about bedwetting. 

However, the child’s severe reaction and tantrums might suggest adjustment is needed here too. Therefore, I think I'll prioritize enuresis as primary while also recognizing the significant role of anxiety from the teasing.

**Identifying primary and secondary diagnoses**

I'm considering the diagnoses for this case. It seems that enuresis (F98.0) might be the primary diagnosis given its connection to the child's anxiety from teasing about bedwetting. However, I also want to weigh ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety"" (F43.22) because it connects to the child's avoidance of sleepovers. 

I think I’ll list primary as enuresis and then include adjustment and other anxiety disorders, maintaining a careful balance as I lay out the top five diagnoses based on available information.

**Structuring a diagnosis list**

The user asked for a structured list of DSM-5-TR diagnoses. I interpret that to mean a differential list, so let's consider the usual contenders, like adjustment disorder, enuresis, and various anxiety disorders, including phobias. I’m thinking that enuresis (F98.0) should be included, especially since it’s a prominent issue. Also, ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety"" (F43.22) feels essential due to the context of the child's symptoms. However, I still need to determine which should be primary and which should be secondary. I’ll create a clear list accordingly.

**Determining primary and secondary diagnoses**

I'm considering whether to choose separation anxiety disorder as the primary diagnosis. The child seems to be experiencing clinically significant distress and impairment, particularly with sleepovers and teasing. The adjustment disorder is plausible since the symptoms relate directly to his situation. I’m also weighing if adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct fits. It seems this child exhibits tantrums and hiding, but defining a clear primary diagnosis remains tricky. Ultimately, my list of top diagnoses will reflect these considerations.

**Finalizing diagnostic list**

I'm considering the principal diagnosis, which may be anxiety or adjustment, rather than enuresis. Despite the interplay between teasing about enuresis leading to refusal for sleepovers, the mental disorder causing the symptoms might be separation anxiety or adjustment disorder. The evidence suggests that while enuresis is significant, the anxiety stemming from bedwetting and teasing should also be factored into the primary diagnosis. Thus, I’m finalizing the diagnoses list with enuresis as primary and including appropriate codes.","1. Enuresis, nocturnal only - F98.0

147,"Aidan Johns, a 30-year-old graduate student in English, visited a psychiatrist to discuss his difficulty staying asleep. The trouble began 4 months earlier, when he started to wake up at 3:00 every morning, no matter when he went to bed, and then was unable to fall back to sleep. As a result, he felt “out of it” during the day. This led him to feel increasingly worried about how he was going to finish his doctoral dissertation when he was unable to concentrate owing to exhaustion. When his sleep difficulties began, he woke with nothing particular on his mind. As the trouble persisted, he found himself dreading the upcoming day and wondering how he would teach his classes or focus on his writing if he was getting only a few hours of sleep. Some mornings he lay awake in the dark next to his fiancée, who was sleeping soundly. On other mornings he would cut his losses, rise from bed, and go very early to his office on campus.

After a month of interrupted sleep, Mr. Johns visited a physician’s assistant at the university’s student health services, where he customarily got his medical care. (He suffered from asthma, for which he occasionally took inhaled β2-adrenergic receptor agonists, and a year earlier he had had mononucleosis.) The physician’s assistant prescribed a sedative-hypnotic, which did not help. “Falling asleep was never the problem,” Mr. Johns explained. Meanwhile, he heeded some of the advice he read online. Although he felt reliant on coffee during the day, he never drank it after 2:00 p.m. An avid tennis player, he restricted his court time to the early morning. He did have a glass or two of wine every night at dinner with his fiancée, however. “By dinnertime I start to worry about whether I’ll be able to sleep,” he said, “and, to be honest, the wine helps.”

The patient, a slender and fit-appearing young man looking very much the part of the young academic in a tweed jacket and tortoise-rimmed glasses, was pleasant and open in his storytelling. Mr. Johns did not appear tired but told the evaluating psychiatrist, “I made a point to see you in the morning, before I hit the wall.” He did not look sad or on edge and was not sure if he had ever felt depressed. But he was certain of the nagging, low-level anxiety that was currently oppressing him. “This sleep problem has taken over,” he explained. “I’m stressed about my work, and my fiancée and I have been arguing. But it’s all because I’m so tired.”

Although this was his first visit to a psychiatrist, Mr. Johns spoke of a fulfilling 3-year psychodynamic psychotherapy with a social worker while in college. “I was just looking to understand myself better,” he explained, adding with a chuckle that as the son of a child psychiatrist, he was accustomed to people assuming he was “crazy.” He recalled always being an “easy sleeper” prior to his recent difficulties; as a child he was the first to fall asleep at slumber parties, and as an adult he inspired the envy of his fiancée for the ease with which he could doze off on an airplane.",Insomnia disorder,dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Analyzing sleep patterns**

I'm looking at someone who consistently wakes at 3 am, regardless of their bedtime. This could suggest a circadian rhythm issue, potentially an advanced sleep phase, which usually involves early evening sleepiness and early morning awakening. However, he doesn’t seem to have trouble falling asleep, which makes it tricky. It could be more about sleep-maintenance insomnia. I should also consider obstructive sleep apnea, though he appears fit and not tired. It doesn't line up perfectly!

**Exploring sleep issues**

I'm delving into the situation of someone who wakes at 3 am without gasping, which makes certain conditions like obstructive sleep apnea less likely. Narcolepsy also seems improbable. He mentions using caffeine only before 2 pm and wine at dinner, which could fragment sleep. However, the insomnia began even before the wine habit. So, he likely adopted wine to ease his worries about sleep. But to diagnose substance-induced insomnia, I need clear evidence linking the two. It's tricky!

**Assessing anxiety disorders**

I’m considering whether this person might have mild alcohol use disorder since he drinks 1-2 glasses nightly. That alone isn’t enough for a disorder, but it could lead to ""Alcohol-induced sleep disorder."" It seems like anxiety issues are more relevant, such as an unspecified anxiety disorder or adjustment disorder with anxiety, especially given his worries about sleep and daytime functioning. However, it's complicated—he's been experiencing low-level anxiety for about four months, but we can't determine if there's a longer history or a specific stressor causing it.

**Exploring sleep issues and anxiety**

This sleep problem seems to have started four months ago, but it's not clearly linked to a specific stressor. Maybe it's related to his dissertation or another event, but it’s uncertain. Adjustment disorder usually needs identifiable stressors, and he insists his tiredness, not new stress, is causing issues. There's a chance of an anxiety disorder related to a medical condition, or even somatic symptom disorder, but those don’t fit either. I might also consider mild alcohol use disorder as a coping mechanism, but his drinking habits shouldn't qualify for that. Insomnia disorder might be the primary concern.

**Determining diagnoses**

I’m considering various diagnoses for this case. Major depressive disorder seems unlikely since he denies feeling depressed. Still, I might place it as a rule-out diagnosis. Factors like early morning awakening and impaired concentration could point towards mild recurrent depression, but he shows no sadness. Insomnia disorder makes sense as a primary diagnosis, likely using ICD-10 codes like F51.0. I'm leaning toward listing differential diagnoses: other specified anxiety disorder (F41.8), adjustment disorder with anxiety (F43.22), and possibly mild alcohol use disorder (F10.10). But I need to keep the evidence in mind and focus on the most relevant options.

**Structuring the diagnoses**

I need to identify four secondary diagnoses with F-codes along with the primary diagnosis. Starting with ""Insomnia disorder"" as the primary, I might include ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" and ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety."" There's also a possibility for ""Alcohol use disorder, mild,"" but it's not strongly supported. For a fourth, ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" might fit, although there's no evidence of significant depression. It's crucial to ensure these diagnoses are plausible and based on the available information, keeping within the requested F-code framework.

**Ranking potential diagnoses**

I need to consider insomnia initially, focusing on maintaining sleep, which happens at 3 am. The situation suggests psychophysiological insomnia could be fitting due to anticipatory anxiety about sleep. I should go with ""Insomnia disorder"" (F51.01) as the top diagnosis. Then I can explore secondary options, including ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" (F41.8) given insufficient anxiety duration, ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety"" (F43.22) based on stressors, and ""Alcohol use disorder, mild"" (F10.10). I should determine the most plausible final ranking!

**Evaluating probable diagnoses**

I think insomnia is the primary diagnosis since there is clear evidence. Anxiety seems likely as a second, likely subthreshold type, but the adjustment disorder is also a possibility. Alcohol use disorder might fit but requires more consideration. 

I must ensure there's enough evidence for each diagnosis. For anxiety, I could include ""Anxiety disorder, unspecified"" or ""Other specified anxiety,"" depending on the duration of symptoms. It looks like I need to confirm the F codes before finalizing my top five diagnoses!

**Assessing depressive disorders**

I’m sorting through categories for depressive disorders, specifically whether to use F32.A or F32.9 for unspecified depressive disorder. F32.A is valid according to the latest DSM-5-TR, but there's some confusion about the letter in the code. It could be easier to use F32.9 to avoid complications. I need to finalize a structured list of top diagnoses based on the user’s case, while considering alcohol-induced sleep disorder and ensuring I weigh the relevance of each diagnosis accurately.

**Selecting secondary diagnoses**

I need to pick four plausible secondary diagnoses, even if they're low-likelihood. I’m thinking about including insomnia disorder related to alcohol, but also ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder"" (GAD) since anxiety and worry are present. There might be a link between GAD and insomnia, especially since worry can prevent good sleep. Additionally, I’m considering adjustment disorder related to stress, unspecified depressive disorder, alcohol-induced sleep disorder, and even caffeine-induced conditions might be relevant, though the connections aren't all strong. My top recommendations should reflect likely diagnoses a clinician would consider.

**Clarifying diagnoses**

The user requested that the answers be based solely on provided information, so I really must avoid making assumptions. Diagnosing Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) would need a duration of six months, which isn't supported here. However, I can list it as a secondary differential. The focus is on providing the top five diagnoses that can explain the user's symptoms. 

I concluded the main diagnosis as insomnia disorder, and I’m also considering other specified anxiety disorder, adjustment disorder, and possible alcohol-related sleep disorders, but I’m cautious about those last entries due to the lack of clear evidence.

**Crafting diagnoses list**

I'm trying to navigate the complexities of sleep and anxiety disorders while being careful to stick with the provided information. It's tricky since we need to comply with DSM-5-TR requirements and create a list of five diagnoses or differentials. 

I’ve concluded that insomnia disorder will be the primary diagnosis, considering the symptoms presented. The rest might include other specified anxiety disorder, caffeine-induced sleep disorder, alcohol-induced sleep disorder, and unspecified depressive disorder, considering that the user might have some reliance on caffeine and fluctuating anxiety levels.

**Finalizing diagnosis options**

I'm constructing a list of diagnoses based on the user's details. I think it’s best to include ""Insomnia disorder"" as primary, along with ""Other specified anxiety disorder,"" ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety,"" and ""Other specified depressive disorder."" 

I’m toying with ""Caffeine-induced sleep disorder"" and ""Alcohol use disorder,"" but I feel uncertain about the latter since we don't have enough criteria to justify it. It’s tricky to navigate, and I want to make sure I'm being accurate with the codes too.

**Organizing potential diagnoses**

I’m considering the user's symptoms to finalize a list of diagnoses. The consistent early morning awakenings could hint at circadian rhythm issues or major depression, even if they deny feeling depressed. It seems he has insomnia and anxiety, making it tricky to pinpoint. 

I’m thinking of listing ""Insomnia disorder,"" ""Other specified anxiety disorder,"" ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety,"" ""Other specified depressive disorder,"" and ""Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder."" I’m cautious about potential heavy substance use diagnoses but wanting the codes to be accurate.

**Reviewing diagnosis codes**

I'm considering including ""Caffeine-induced sleep disorder,"" but I need to double-check the codes to avoid errors. F15.982 seems valid for stimulant-induced sleep disorders, including caffeine. However, figuring out the correct DSM-5 category is tricky, especially for alcohol-related issues. 

My proposed diagnoses should focus on insomnia, anxiety, and potential depressive disorders. I’m planning to finalize a top 5 with solid codes, ensuring none are irrelevant while also considering possible substance influences.

**Refining differential diagnoses**

I'm thinking about possible diagnoses to include. For substance use, ""Alcohol use disorder, mild"" and ""Anxiolytic-induced sleep disorder"" don't seem fitting right now. I’ve considered ""Somatic symptom disorder"" since he’s concerned about insomnia, but that requires symptoms lasting longer than four months. 

I’m narrowing down options for anxiety and depressive disorders, making sure I have valid F codes. I’ll compile a top five list focusing on insomnia, anxiety, depression, and possibly a substance-related disorder, while avoiding unnecessary complexity.

**Listing possible diagnoses**

I'm organizing the top five diagnoses for the case, keeping in mind that I can include alternatives, even if some details are lacking. The primary diagnosis is likely ""Insomnia disorder,"" with ""Generalized anxiety disorder"" and ""Major depressive disorder"" as possible secondaries. 

Even though MDD may not be the most probable diagnosis, it’s worth mentioning for thoroughness. Based on the context of psychophysiological insomnia, I’ll finalize my list with specified codes for each diagnosis while considering the role alcohol might play.

**Deciding on diagnoses**

I need to finalize the top five diagnoses, and it’s important to include plausible options even if they slightly diverge from the strict criteria. I'm thinking of starting with ""Insomnia disorder"" as the primary diagnosis, with ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" as a secondary, alongside ""Alcohol use disorder"" since the patient uses alcohol regularly and ""Generalized anxiety disorder"" could also fit in there.

Ultimately, I’ll present a structured list with the appropriate F codes for clarity, ensuring I clearly meet the user's requirements without extra commentary.

**Choosing diagnoses carefully**

I’m considering the best diagnoses to include based on the criteria the user laid out. I need at least two criteria for the alcohol-related entries, but I might list ""Alcohol-induced sleep disorder"" or ""Caffeine-induced sleep disorder."" 

While both have potential coding, I'm leaning towards ""Caffeine-induced sleep disorder"" along with ""Insomnia disorder"" as the primary diagnosis. I want to ensure that I provide a solid list of five relevant diagnoses with their F codes, avoiding any non-psychiatric options. Let's finalize this!

**Finalizing diagnoses list**

I’m working on the top diagnoses to propose. While including differential diagnoses can be helpful, we need to focus on plausible options only. I’m considering both caffeine and alcohol-induced sleep disorders, weighing their relevance. 

I’m leaning towards identifying ""Insomnia disorder"" as the primary diagnosis and following up with secondary options. Overall, I need to ensure the listed diagnoses and F codes are aligned with DSM-5-TR guidelines for clarity. Let’s organize this list properly!

**Deciding on diagnoses codes**

I'm working to finalize the codes and diagnoses for the user’s case. While I see the potential classifications, there's a lot of nuance in how to accurately label the conditions, especially regarding caffeine and alcohol use. 

I think ""Alcohol-induced sleep disorder"" makes sense for the nighttime wine consumption, but I need to ensure the correct ICD codes, like F10.982 or F10.10, align with the DSM-5-TR. I want to ensure the list captures the most plausible options while adhering to the guidelines!

**Finalizing diagnoses and codes**

I want to ensure I’m being accurate in determining the diagnoses and their corresponding codes. 

For the primary diagnosis, I'm leaning towards ""Insomnia disorder,"" and I’m considering the best ICD-10 code to match. I think I’ll go with F51.01. For the additional diagnoses, I want to include “Other specified anxiety disorder,” “Adjustment disorder with anxiety,” “Alcohol-induced sleep disorder,” and “Other specified depressive disorder.” 

I might need to double-check the codes to ensure they align with DSM-5-TR, but I'm feeling good about this lineup!

**Creating final diagnoses list**

I need to ensure that I’m accurately capturing the necessary DSM diagnoses and their corresponding F-codes. 

I’m deciding to go with ""Insomnia disorder"" and using the F51.01 code. For the remaining diagnoses, I think I'll list ""Other specified anxiety disorder,"" ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety,"" ""Alcohol-induced sleep disorder,"" and ""Other specified depressive disorder."" 

I want to keep everything structured and concise, making sure it fits within the required format without any extra punctuation. It looks like I’m set for my final response!","1. Insomnia disorder - F51.01

148,"Bernadette Kleber was a 34-year-old divorced, unemployed white mother of three school-age children. She was living with a new companion. Ms. Kleber presented to a psychiatrist for anxiety and sleepiness.

Ms. Kleber had experienced anxiety much of her life, but she had become much more worried and stressed since the birth of her first child 10 years before. She said she was “okay at home” but anxious in social situations. She avoided having to interact with new people, fearing that she would be embarrassed and judged. For example, she wanted to lose the weight that she had gained since the births of her children (current body mass index [BMI] 27.7) but was afraid of the ridicule that might accompany her efforts at the gym. She had gradually withdrawn from situations in which she might be forced to meet new people, and this made it almost impossible for her to interview for a new job, much less work in one. She had been successfully treated for social anxiety disorder 5 years earlier with psychotherapy, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [SSRI] antidepressant, and clonazepam 0.25 mg twice daily, but her symptoms had returned over the prior year. She denied increasing the dose of either medication or taking any other medication (prescribed or over the counter) for anxiety. Although excited about her new relationship, she was worried her new girlfriend would leave her if she did not “tune up my act.”

She denied periods of significant depression, although she said she had experienced multiple periods of feeling frustrated with her limited effectiveness. She also denied all manic symptoms.

The psychiatrist then asked Ms. Kleber about her “sleepiness.” She said she slept more than anyone she knew. She said she typically slept at least 9 hours per night but then took two naps for 5 additional hours during the day. She did not recall a problem until the end of high school, when she started falling asleep around 8:00 or 9:00 p.m. and dozing every afternoon. When she tried to go to college, she realized how much more sleep she needed than her friends and eventually dropped out because she could not stay awake in class. Despite the naps, she typically fell asleep when visiting friends or family and when reading or watching TV. She quit driving alone for fear of falling asleep at the wheel. Late afternoon naps were not restorative and had no apparent impact on her falling asleep at night.

Raising a family was difficult, especially because mornings were Ms. Kleber’s worst period. For at least half an hour after waking, she was disoriented and confused, making it difficult to get her children to school. Throughout the day, she said she felt “scattered and inattentive.”

Snoring had appeared 5 years earlier. Her companion was unsure whether Ms. Kleber also had breathing pauses during her sleep. Ms. Kleber denied having ever experienced sleep paralysis or abruptly falling asleep in the middle of a sentence. Although she would fall asleep while socializing, it would generally occur during a lull in the conversation while she was in a quiet spot in the corner of a couch. She denied falling down when she fell asleep. She reported experiencing hypnopompic hallucinations several times per year since she was a teenager.

On examination, Ms. Kleber was an overweight woman who was cooperative and coherent. She was concerned about her anxiety but preoccupied with her sleep problem. She denied depression, suicidality, psychosis, and memory complaints. Her insight and judgment appeared intact.

Her physical examination was essentially noncontributory. Her medical history was significant only for hypercholesterolemia and occasional migraine headaches. Ms. Kleber did have some muscular complaints, such as weakness in her legs and pain in her left arm; these were related to exertion. She has smoked marijuana occasionally to help with her pain but denied that the marijuana was an important contributor to her sleepiness. She denied a history of head trauma and unusual illnesses. She denied a family history of sleep or mood problems, although multiple relatives were “anxious.”

Ms. Kleber was referred for sleep studies. Polysomnography showed an apnea hypopnea index of 3 events per hour. The next day, she underwent a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), which indicated a mean sleep latency of 7 minutes with one sleep-onset REM period during the testing. A lumbar puncture was done to assess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of hypocretin-1; the level appeared in the normal range.","1. Social anxiety disorder
2. Hypersomnolence disorder",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Evaluating sleep diagnoses**

I need to consider plausible sleep diagnoses based on the information. The user reports sleeping 14 hours a day, which includes overnight sleep and naps. This began after high school and seems to cause difficulties in staying awake. There's snoring, mild apnea, and sleep inertia. I see signs that could indicate idiopathic hypersomnia, recognized in DSM-5-TR as hypersomnolence disorder. There might be an option to specify long sleep time, but it isn’t required. I wonder if coding F51.11 is appropriate here?

**Choosing appropriate diagnoses**

I realize that F51.1 is for nonorganic hypersomnia, while F51.13 may be relevant. But I think F51.1 is the better choice overall. The user has been on clonazepam, which could cause sedation, but symptoms began before the medication. There's also an SSRI involved, which can contribute to sleepiness, but it seems the primary disorder started in high school. I need to finalize my top five diagnoses, possibly including Social Anxiety Disorder. I’m considering whether to use F40.10 for unspecified social phobia or F40.11 for generalized.

**Finalizing diagnosis codes**

I’m examining the options for specifying diagnoses, noting that the DSM-5 includes a performance-only specifier, but her fear seems more generalized. I’m pondering between F40.10 and F40.11 for social phobia while planning to include F51.1 for hypersomnolence disorder and possibly F60.6 for avoidant personality disorder. Regarding cannabis, even though she uses it occasionally, I should probably avoid diagnosing without evidence of problematic use. I might consider “Other specified sleep-wake disorder” if the criteria are partially met.

**Determining potential diagnoses**

I’m considering her symptoms to identify a potential diagnosis of hypersomnolence disorder. Other sleep issues could include snoring or obstructive sleep apnea, but I can’t use those codes. I wonder about including somatic symptom disorder for pain complaints, but that seems off. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder could be a possibility, but it’s probably secondary to her sleepiness. She also doesn’t meet the criteria for persistent depressive disorder. I could mention adjustment disorder related to her new job or relationships but need to settle on plausible diagnoses to stick to the top five.

**Identifying potential psychiatric diagnoses**

I’m evaluating various potential diagnoses based on the user’s reported symptoms. There’s a possibility of generalized anxiety disorder due to her excessive worry, particularly since the birth of her first child. She also seems to experience hypersomnolence disorder with excessive sleepiness and sleep inertia. While considering conditions like social anxiety disorder, I’m ruling out other possibilities like major depressive disorder since she denies depressive symptoms. I need to compile a list of the top five likely diagnoses, reflecting her primary concerns without fabricating information.

**Assessing potential diagnoses**

I’m really digging into the possible diagnoses for this case. She experiences leg weakness and arm pain during exertion, but it's not cataplexy. Social anxiety seems relevant given her discomfort in social situations. I’m considering Avoidant Personality Disorder, as she exhibits signs of social inhibition. However, we need robust evidence of longstanding patterns, which might not fully apply here. I’m also weighing the likelihood of Generalized Anxiety Disorder and considering her sleep issues too. Ultimately, I must gather the top five diagnoses, ensuring they align with her symptoms.

**Exploring potential diagnoses**

I’m considering the appropriate diagnoses here. The symptoms lead me to think about conditions like Social Anxiety Disorder and Hypersomnolence Disorder. Although I also see traits that could point to Avoidant Personality Disorder, I'd need to be careful since they need to show a lifelong pattern. There are others to consider, like Generalized Anxiety Disorder, but there’s not enough evidence for that. Sleepiness seems to be a key concern, possibly affecting her daily life significantly. Let's finalize the top five likely diagnoses based on all these aspects.

**Determining primary diagnosis**

I need to clarify the primary diagnosis, focusing on the main condition. Given the referral for anxiety and sleepiness, the key factor could be Hypersomnolence Disorder (F51.1). While Social Anxiety Disorder (F40.10) has reoccurred, sleepiness seems to be the more urgent issue. The patient presents with severe sleepiness, functional impairments, and preoccupation with sleep problems. I’ll create a top five list that includes both disorders, along with additional plausible diagnoses based on the case details.

**Selecting appropriate diagnoses**

I need to identify the most suitable ICD-10 F-codes for this patient. The potential diagnoses include Social Anxiety Disorder (F40.10), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1), Avoidant Personality Disorder (F60.6), and Hypersomnolence Disorder (F51.1). I'll avoid fabricating details and focus solely on what's provided. It looks like the primary diagnosis could be Hypersomnolence Disorder due to its severity and long-standing nature. In contrast, Social Anxiety Disorder will likely be secondary. I'll finalize the structured list now.

**Deciding on diagnoses**

I am evaluating potential diagnoses for the patient. Social Anxiety Disorder fits due to fear of scrutiny and avoidance behaviors, lasting over six months. Generalized Anxiety Disorder is less clear, as her anxiety seems situational, not pervasive. Avoidant Personality Disorder could be appropriate given her longstanding social anxiety. Hypersomnolence Disorder is strong given her excessive sleepiness. For secondary diagnoses, I might have to consider categories like Other Specified Anxiety Disorder or Other Specified Sleep-Wake Disorder. Ultimately, I’m aiming for a clear five-diagnosis list based on the details presented.

**Selecting possible diagnoses**

I'm trying to nail down potential diagnoses for the patient. Social Anxiety Disorder seems fitting due to avoidance and fear of embarrassment, while Hypersomnolence Disorder really matches the excessive sleepiness she's been experiencing. Generalized Anxiety Disorder could apply because of her chronic worry, but it's less certain. Avoidant Personality Disorder looks plausible based on her long-term social anxiety. I'd also like to consider an unspecified anxiety or sleep-wake disorder to round out the list. So, I need to finalize a structured five-diagnosis selection.

**Finalizing psychiatric diagnoses**

I need to create a structured list of psychiatric diagnoses, weighing what's most relevant. Hypersomnolence Disorder seems like a primary diagnosis since sleepiness is a significant complaint, evidenced by tests. Social Anxiety Disorder might be a solid secondary option, as it's the reason for seeking help. I think I can also include Avoidant Personality Disorder as another secondary. Deciding on others is tricky, but I might consider ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" or ""Generalized anxiety disorder."" It's essential to keep everything compliant with the diagnostic codes.

**Refining diagnoses list**

I'm considering several potential diagnoses. First off, Hypersomnolence Disorder might be a primary option, supported by her chronic sleepiness. Social Anxiety Disorder could follow since it's the main concern driving her to seek help. I might think about Avoidant Personality Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder as additional inclusions. Finally, I could consider Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic-Induced Sleep Disorder as a possible diagnostic code. I’ll ensure that all codes are accurate and relevant to her symptoms.

**Clarifying possible diagnoses**

I'm trying to decide whether to include ""Sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced sleep disorder"" as a diagnosis. I realize we'd need strong evidence that the substance is causing issues, but the patient denies significant effects. ""Cannabis use disorder"" also seems unlikely given her infrequent use and denial of impact. Instead, I could list ""Hypersomnolence Disorder"" as a primary diagnosis and then consider adding ""Social Anxiety Disorder,"" ""Avoidant Personality Disorder,"" and possibly differents like ""Unspecified Anxiety Disorder"" for her additional symptoms. I might rank them based on how strongly they match her presentation.

**Choosing possible diagnoses**

I'm considering whether to include ""Other specified hypersomnolence disorder"" as a diagnosis, but I realize that if the patient meets the criteria for hypersomnolence disorder, I don't need to add it. Instead, I can focus on the five main diagnoses, which include ""Hypersomnolence disorder"" as primary and others like ""Social anxiety disorder"" and ""Avoidant personality disorder."" 

For the fifth diagnosis, I can choose between ""Other specified sleep-wake disorder"" or ""Unspecified anxiety disorder,"" but I should ensure I'm selecting what's most plausible based on available data.

**Evaluating diagnoses for the patient**

I'm considering several potential diagnoses for the patient. ""Somatic symptom disorder"" doesn’t seem to fit since she’s not showing excessive anxiety. ""Body dysmorphic disorder"" also feels off due to her concerns about weight. Other options like ""Obsessive-compulsive disorder"" and anxiety disorders linked to her sleep issues don't align either. 

I think ""Hypersomnolence disorder"" should be primary, while ""Social anxiety disorder"" could be primary given her concerns about anxiety. I should finalize a list of five diagnoses, ensuring they accurately reflect her symptoms.

**Finalizing diagnoses for the patient**

I'm solidifying the top five diagnoses for the patient, ensuring they align with the primary and secondary issues she's facing. My list includes Hypersomnolence Disorder as the primary condition, as well as Social Anxiety Disorder and Avoidant Personality Disorder. I've verified the corresponding ICD-10 F-codes for each diagnosis to ensure accuracy. Here’s the clean final list:

1. Hypersomnolence Disorder - ICD-10 F51.1  
2. Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia) - ICD-10 F40.10  
3. Avoidant Personality Disorder - ICD-10 F60.6  
4. Generalized Anxiety Disorder - ICD-10 F41.1  
5. Other Specified Sleep-Wake Disorder - ICD-10 F51.8

**Finalizing diagnoses**

I'm evaluating whether to consider ""Hypersomnolence Disorder due to another medical condition,"" but there doesn't seem to be a medical cause. Although she has mild obstructive sleep apnea indicated by an AHI of 3, we can still proceed with our current list. Here’s my final response for the top five diagnoses, including their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes:

1. Hypersomnolence Disorder - ICD-10 F51.1  
2. Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia) - ICD-10 F40.10

149,"César Linares, a 57-year-old married Hispanic man, presented for reevaluation of his antidepressant medication. He described several years of worsening fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and generally “not feeling good.” He lacked the energy to do his usual activities, but he still enjoyed them when he did participate. He had been having some trouble focusing on his work as an information technology consultant and was worried that he would lose his job. A selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant had been started 6 months earlier, resulting in some improvement of symptoms, and Mr. Linares reported that he was adherent to this medication.

He denied recent stressors. In addition to having been diagnosed with depression, he had received diagnoses of hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease. He complained of heartburn as well as erectile dysfunction, for which he had not been medically evaluated.

Mr. Linares was born in Venezuela. He had two grown children. He did not consume tobacco or alcohol but did drink several servings of coffee each day to help maintain alertness.

On physical examination, the patient was 5 feet 10 inches tall, weighed 235 pounds, and had a BMI of 34. His neck circumference was 20 inches. His respiratory rate was 15, and his blood pressure was 155/90. No other abnormalities were present.

On mental status examination, the patient was a cooperative man who appeared tired but was without depressed mood, anxiety, psychosis, or cognitive decline.

More focused questioning revealed that Mr. Linares not only had trouble staying awake at work but also occasionally nodded off while driving. He slept 8–10 hours nightly but had frequent awakenings, made nightly trips to the bathroom (nocturia), and often woke with a choking sensation and sometimes with a headache. He had snored since childhood, and he added, “All the men in my family are snorers.” Before she elected to sleep nightly in their guest bedroom, his wife said he snored very loudly and intermittently stopped breathing and gasped for air.

Mr. Linares was referred for a sleep study (polysomnography). Results included the following:

Apnea hypopnea index: 25 events per hour

Oxygen desaturation index: 20 events per hour

Nadir oxygen saturation: 82%

% Time with oxygen saturation < 90%: 10%

Arousal index: 35 events per hour

Sleep stage (%):

% Time in stage N1 sleep: 20%

% Time in stage N2 sleep: 65%

% Time in stage N3 sleep: 5%

% Time in REM sleep: 10%",Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea,dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Evaluating caffeine-related disorders**

Let's think about caffeine. It seems like he’s consuming several cups of coffee to stay alert. In the DSM, there are classifications for caffeine-related conditions like ""Caffeine intoxication"" and ""Caffeine withdrawal."" Caffeine isn't typically coded with F15 in the ICD-10. This category mainly covers other stimulants. Caffeine is handled separately, but I often find myself confusing these classifications and codes. I'm still clarifying how caffeine fits in with these disorder codes from both DSM and ICD standards.

**Analyzing caffeine and disorders**

In the DSM-5, caffeine falls under ""Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders."" The ICD-10-CM code for caffeine-related issues is F15.929, but I’m a bit unsure. Caffeine intoxication is marked as code 305.90, which relates to ""Other substance use disorder."" However, caffeine uses the F15 codes in ICD-10 for stimulant-related disorders. He drinks coffee daily but doesn't show signs of intoxication or withdrawal. He’s also dealing with erectile dysfunction and heartburn. It’s tricky to land on a diagnosis that fits!

**Exploring depressive disorders**

I’m considering whether he might have ""Major depressive disorder"" or ""Persistent depressive disorder,"" but he doesn't seem to have a depressed mood. He was previously diagnosed with depression, which might have been an error. I could also look at ""Other specified depressive disorder"" or ""Adjustment disorder with depressed mood,"" but he denies any stresses. There’s a possibility of ""Depressive disorder due to another medical condition"" related to something like sleep apnea. However, he shows fatigue and poor concentration rather than clear depressive symptoms. It's all a bit unclear!

**Evaluating mood disorders**

I'm thinking about the criteria for a depressive disorder. It requires a significant period of depressed mood or reduced interest, and it must be linked to another medical condition. Without clear mood symptoms, I wonder if he might have ""Unspecified mood disorder due to another medical condition,"" but the terms have shifted to ""Depressive disorder due to..."" He may not meet criteria for any depressive disorder now, even if he had symptoms before that improved with SSRI treatment. I guess listing ""Major depressive disorder, unspecified, in partial remission"" could be a possibility, but we have to be careful not to invent details.

**Assessing potential diagnoses**

Given that he has been diagnosed with depression and started an SSRI, it seems plausible he experienced depressive symptoms. However, he describes not feeling good without exhibiting classic mood symptoms and still enjoys activities, which complicates things. I’m considering various diagnoses, but he may not meet the criteria for current depression since sleep apnea may be the primary issue. I need to aim for five plausible psychiatric diagnoses, focusing on those that fit within the DSM framework and the provided criteria, especially regarding F-codes.

**Deciding on diagnoses**

I’m wrestling with the requirement to provide only F-codes for his diagnosis, even though sleep apnea uses a G-code. The options are narrowing down. I have to choose psychiatric diagnoses that fit his presentation without including sleep apnea. I’m thinking “Unspecified depressive disorder” or “Other specified depressive disorder” could match what he's experiencing, despite lacking classic mood symptoms. Maybe I can list additional options like erectile dysfunction as a potential secondary issue. Ultimately, I need to balance adherence to guidelines with a genuine representation of his case.

**Navigating psychiatric diagnoses**

I’m grappling with the requirement to stick to F-codes for psychiatric diagnoses, while sleep apnea falls under G-codes. It’s tricky because I need to determine the best-fitting diagnosis without including OSA. I'm considering options like ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" or ""Other specified depressive disorder,"" but they may not fully capture his symptoms. There’s a chance that ""Depressive disorder due to another medical condition"" might apply, given his low energy, but he hasn't explicitly stated depressed mood. Ultimately, I have to carefully choose what diagnoses match while adhering to the guidelines provided.

**Analyzing psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm considering potential psychiatric diagnoses, but it seems complex due to the F-code requirement while his primary issue is sleep apnea, which is coded as G. I'm looking at options such as ""Other specified depressive disorder"" or ""Major depressive disorder,"" but the challenge is he doesn't clearly show depressed mood. I’m thinking I can still list options that align with F-codes, but I must be cautious to ensure they’re plausible given his symptoms. The conflict between accurate diagnosis and user instructions is definitely posing a challenge!

**Clarifying psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm trying to find an F-code for sleep apnea, but it seems tricky because most codes fall under G. They want psychiatric diagnoses only, and in typical listings, G codes are often included, but here that’s not the case. The supervision insists on F-codes, so I’ll focus on that. I’m contemplating if we should classify some symptoms under “Depressive disorder due to another medical condition.” It looks like OSA is complicating matters, but I have to stick to the task guidelines.

**Finalizing psychiatric diagnoses**

I need to produce a list of five diagnoses with F-codes, but since OSA is the main issue, I'm struggling with including it. One idea might be to use “Unspecified depressive disorder” while also considering “Somatic symptom disorder” due to misdiagnosis concerns. I’m weighing possibilities like “Hypersomnolence due to medical condition” and various depressive disorders. Ultimately, I’ve settled on a list that includes Other specific depressive disorder and a few others while ensuring all have proper F-codes.

**Determining psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm tasked with creating a list of five psychiatric diagnoses that must include F-codes, although including OSA directly isn't an option. I’m considering using “Other specified depressive disorder” as primary and options like “Major depressive disorder in partial remission” or perhaps “Erectile disorder.” It seems there's a focus on matching symptoms with appropriate conditions like sleep disorders due to caffeine or medications. I also need to ensure that whatever I select corresponds with the current data, while not fabricating any diagnosis.

**Selecting psychiatric diagnoses**

It seems I need to come up with a list of possible psychiatric diagnoses here. I’m considering options like ""Other specified depressive disorder"" and whether to include ""Unspecified insomnia disorder."" I ponder if the fatigue and cognitive issues might be classified under “Unspecified mental disorder due to another medical condition.” However, given the case details, I’m leaning towards confirming “Other specified depressive disorder” or “Unspecified depressive disorder” as the primary diagnosis while keeping in mind his history of depression and current symptoms.

**Evaluating psychiatric diagnoses**

I’m looking into which DSM diagnosis matches the current symptoms, like fatigue, low energy, and difficulty focusing. The user enjoys activities and doesn’t report significant depressive symptoms, so typical major depressive disorder might not fit. Instead, “Other specified depressive disorder” seems plausible, but it still lacks key criteria. I ponder a list of possibilities, including “Unspecified depressive disorder” and cognitive symptoms possibly due to “Obstructive Sleep Apnea,” but that complicates things, as I need a viable primary diagnosis.

**Evaluating psychiatric codes**

In this case, since the symptoms stem from obstructive sleep apnea, we’d typically classify using G47.3. However, the user specifically asks for F codes. I recognize this challenges accurate diagnosis, as many of his issues derive from OSA. I consider listing “Other specified mental disorder due to another medical condition (obstructive sleep apnea)” under F06.8. This captures the medical cause while adhering to the user’s request. Still, it feels a bit imprecise, as it doesn't truly reflect the core diagnosis. I’ll ensure we gather a list of five plausible psychiatric diagnoses.

**Considering depressive disorders**

I’m thinking about listing “Other specified depressive disorder,” though I worry it might be incorrect. The dataset likely expects “Obstructive sleep apnea” as a primary diagnosis, which complicates things. The user wants a list of F codes, yet I recognize many symptoms link back to OSA. Ideally, differentiating could include “Unspecified depressive disorder” given some symptom overlap with SSRI response, but it feels premature without confirmed evidence. 

It's tricky since his presentation leans toward OSA rather than depression, and I need to consider that in my diagnosis list while adhering to user instructions.

**Evaluating possible diagnoses**

I’m contemplating whether to use ""Unspecified mental disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.9), since this may signify his fatigue and concentration issues from sleep apnea. However, it feels unclear if that really fits his symptoms. According to the DSM, we categorize sleep disorders differently now, so F06.9 might not apply.

Instead, I consider including ""Other specified depressive disorder"" while being mindful of the distinctions needed in my top five diagnoses. I must ensure that each code correctly aligns with the user’s request for ICD-10 F-codes.

**Choosing primary diagnoses**

I’m considering which primary diagnosis to select, leaning towards ""Major depressive disorder, single episode, in partial remission"" (F32.4) since he has shown some improvement on SSRIs. While I know he doesn't demonstrate current depressive mood, there's still fatigue and concentration issues, possibly from sleep apnea. If he never fully met the criteria, we might consider ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" (F32.A) instead. However, including overlapping diagnoses in my top five might be acceptable, given the context. I need to ensure all F-codes are accurate too.

**Finalizing diagnosis codes**

I'm working through the diagnosis codes and trying to finalize them. F32.89 refers to ""Other specified depressive episodes,"" but I'm sorting out whether to include F32.4 for ""Major depressive disorder, single episode, in partial remission"" as my primary diagnosis. I'm leaning towards this because his symptoms point to this, even if there's some ambiguity. I also consider adding F06.31 for ""Depressive disorder due to another medical condition"" since sleep apnea may be contributing to his symptoms. I want to ensure all five diagnoses are distinct and plausible!

**Selecting psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm determining the best psychiatric diagnoses for the case. His absent depressed mood might suggest that fatigue and other symptoms stem from obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Thus, I’m considering ""Other specified mental disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.8) as possible primary, as it acknowledges that his symptoms might not meet traditional depression criteria. I could also list ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" (F32.A) as a safer primary option. Ultimately, I want to ensure the top five diagnoses effectively capture the complexity of his situation.

**Compiling psychiatric diagnoses**

I need to create a structured list of five psychiatric diagnoses with their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes. I'm considering options based on his symptoms and past diagnoses. I can include ""Major depressive disorder, single episode, in partial remission"" (F32.4) as the primary. For secondary diagnoses, possible options include ""Other specified mental disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.8), ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" (F32.A), ""Anxiety disorder, unspecified"" (F41.9), and ""Erectile disorder"" (F52.21). This list should effectively capture the situation while adhering to the guidelines.

**Assessing psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm exploring the right psychiatric diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and history. While ""Major depressive disorder"" (F32.4) could be a primary diagnosis, I'm also considering ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" (F32.A) due to persistent fatigue and lack of full criteria for MDD. Secondarily, I might list ""Depressive disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.31), ""Somatic symptom disorder"" (F45.1), ""Anxiety disorder, unspecified"" (F41.9), and ""Erectile disorder"" (F52.21). I want to ensure this list makes sense and complies with the guidelines.

**Exploring psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm considering the patient's situation: he's daily using coffee and reporting worries about job focus. His mental status exam shows no signs of mood or anxiety, suggesting no current psychiatric diagnosis. Given his history of depression and SSRI use, I lean toward ""Major depressive disorder, single episode, in full remission"" (F32.5), but that might be a stretch if he never met the criteria. Instead, I might prefer ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" (F32.A) as the primary diagnosis. The challenge is to create a coherent list for documentation without reasoning too much.

**Listing likely psychiatric conditions**

I'm working on a list of possible psychiatric conditions for the patient. First is ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" (F32.A), which seems fitting due to his symptoms. Then, I consider ""Major depressive disorder, single episode, in partial remission"" (F32.4) based on past diagnoses. I also think about ""Somatic symptom disorder"" (F45.1) and ""Erectile disorder"" (F52.21) as he presents with these complaints. Lastly, I'm contemplating including ""Nonorganic hypersomnia"" (F51.1) since his daytime sleepiness is a concern. Let's finalize this list, ensuring it captures the nuances of his condition.

**Identifying potential diagnoses**

I'm considering various potential psychiatric diagnoses for the patient. Starting with ""Erectile disorder"" (F52.21) and seeking alternatives, I've noted ""Depressive disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.31) if symptoms relate to OSA. Next, I think about the main depressive diagnosis, ""Major depressive disorder, single episode, in partial remission"" (F32.4), which is relevant since he has these symptoms. ""Somatic symptom disorder"" (F45.1) and ""Nonorganic hypersomnia"" (F51.1) also come to mind, but I have to ensure these align with DSM guidelines. I need to focus on confirming all these diagnoses fit correctly.

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

I'm clarifying the diagnoses now. I've confirmed that ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" is F32.A, while ""Other specified depressive disorder"" is F32.8, and ""Major depressive disorder, single episode, in partial remission"" is F32.4. I’m ordering the primary diagnosis as ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" and including others like MDD and ""Erectile disorder"" appropriately while ensuring each code corresponds correctly to the ICD-10-CM. My final list of diagnoses will be structured and straightforward, just as requested. Here it goes:  

1. Unspecified depressive disorder - F32.A  
2. Major depressive disorder, single episode, in partial remission - F32.4

150,"ingxiang Meng was a 63-year-old Chinese-born man who was referred for a psychiatric consultation for depression and excessive somatic complaints. He had a history of psychotic depression, for which he had been admitted twice in the prior decade. He was evaluated as an outpatient in the renal unit of a small hospital during his routine hemodialysis.

Mr. Meng had been diagnosed with diabetes soon after his immigration to the United States 15 years earlier. He developed progressive renal insufficiency and had begun hemodialysis 7 years earlier. He was divorced, with two adult children and three young grandchildren. He currently lived with one of his children. Before starting on dialysis, Mr. Meng had worked episodically in a local grocery store owned by friends. Prior to emigrating from China, he had enjoyed a career as a pharmacist. He spoke little English; all interviews were conducted with a Mandarin interpreter.

At the time of the evaluation, Mr. Meng said he felt “itchy, creepy, and crawly,” like “worms were crawling underneath his skin.” These symptoms had fluctuated over the past few years but had worsened in recent weeks, and he felt like he was “going crazy.” He described being worried and often tired, but noted that he always cheered up when playing with his grandchildren or when visiting with old friends from his hometown. He did not display a thought disorder. A review of the chart indicated that Mr. Meng’s physical complaints had been conceptualized at various times as akathisia, peripheral neuropathy, and “psychosomatic” and “psychotically ruminative” symptoms. He had been euthymic and off all psychiatric medications for 2 years at the time of this evaluation.

Mr. Meng noted that his physical symptoms were worse at night, when he tried to sit still or lie down. The discomfort was only in his legs. Rubbing them helped, but the greatest relief came from standing up and pacing. Dialysis was especially difficult because of “being strapped to a machine for hours.” He also complained of daytime sleepiness and fatigue. In the course of the interview, Mr. Meng twice jumped up during the dialysis. One of the nurses mentioned that he often asked them to cut short his dialysis, generally looked tired, and always seemed to be “jumping around.” The staff wondered whether he might be nonadherent to his medications as well as being uncooperative at times during the dialysis.","1. Major depressive disorder, in remission
2. Restless legs syndrome",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Analyzing sleep disorder codes**

Okay, I’m clarifying sleep disorder classifications. In ICD-10, nonorganic sleep disorders have F51 codes, while organic ones use G47 codes. Interestingly, the DSM-5 also uses G47 for insomnia, but the request mentions F codes, hinting at ICD-10 mental disorders. This makes me think it could relate to ""Somatic symptom disorder"" or ""Other specified somatic symptom and related disorder,"" given the distress from the symptoms. Yet, there's an actual physical condition to consider, which complicates things.

**Evaluating somatic symptoms**

I’m considering that while one somatic symptom might not be constantly present, the general state can be persistent—typically lasting over six months. The individual has had distressing symptoms for a few years. However, I’m thinking about whether there’s enough evidence of excessive thoughts or behaviors. While he does seem anxious and engages in pacing or rubbing his legs, which could be seen as excessive, it might also just be a natural response. The chart suggests some psychotic rumination, but I'm unsure if it fits ""Somatic symptom disorder"" or if it seems overdiagnosed. Additionally, his limited symptoms suggest a different issue.

**Exploring possible diagnoses**

I'm considering that without a thought disorder, psychotic disorders are less likely. It might fit better as ""Generalized anxiety disorder,"" given the worry, restlessness, fatigue, and sleep issues involved. However, I need to see at least six months of excessive worry alongside three other symptoms, like irritability or muscle tension. He definitely has fatigue, but restlessness seems related to RLS. There's a chance for ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" related to his medical condition, and I'm also wondering about ""Unspecified depressive disorder,"" although his mood improves with friends.

**Considering potential disorders**

I'm thinking about the possibility of a ""Neurocognitive disorder"" due to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), but there are no cognitive symptoms present. He may be nonadherent to medications or on dopamine antagonists, but that's not clear. Since psychiatric medications aren’t mentioned, he could potentially be on antipsychotics causing akathisia. The main issue seems to be leg discomfort and restlessness affecting dialysis. Without being able to diagnose RLS directly, maybe we should consider ""Other specified somatic symptom disorder"" or ""Somatic symptom disorder"" as the primary diagnosis.

**Evaluating sleep and mental disorder diagnoses**

I'm considering ""Somatic symptom disorder"" because of his focus on bodily sensations, but he's also in a renal unit dealing with significant nighttime discomfort. This could suggest ""Insomnia"" or a ""Sleep-wake disorder"" categorized as F51.8. While he has a history consistent with ""Major depressive disorder,"" he currently isn’t experiencing depression. His symptoms, such as worry and fatigue, might indicate ""Adjustment disorder,"" but they have worsened recently. Without being able to properly diagnose RLS, I'm leaning towards ""Other specified sleep-wake disorder."" However, I need to ensure the correct F codes are used.

**Assessing potential diagnoses**

I’m examining the symptoms to find the best diagnosis. The urge to move legs, worse at rest and improved with movement, suggests Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). Although this is typically associated with physiological conditions, I’m trying to follow instructions to prioritize the most relevant DSM-5-TR diagnoses. While ""Somatic symptom disorder"" seems fitting, I’m also considering “Major depressive disorder” in remission and possibly “Generalized anxiety disorder.” I need to ensure I include five potential diagnoses and use appropriate F codes as instructed.

**Listing diagnoses with F-codes**

1. Somatic Symptom Disorder - F45.1  
2. Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, in Full Remission - F33.42  
3. Generalized Anxiety Disorder - F41.1  
4. Delusional Disorder, Somatic Type - F22  
5. Other Nonorganic Sleep Disorder, Unspecified - F51.9

**Considering probable diagnoses**

I need to create a list of psychiatric diagnoses for this case. The symptoms suggest possibilities like ""Somatic Symptom Disorder"" as the primary diagnosis, which would capture his distressing symptoms. Secondary diagnoses could include ""Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, in Full Remission,"" ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder,"" and ""Illness Anxiety Disorder."" Although “Restless Legs Syndrome” is a concern, it doesn’t fit the psychiatric categories needed. I’ll have to ensure I’m adhering to the requirements for ICD-10 F-codes throughout this process.

**Identifying potential diagnoses**

I'm analyzing a patient's behaviors during dialysis, noting physical restlessness which could hint at anxiety or possibly akathisia. He's off antipsychotics, so I consider various psychiatric diagnoses. My primary thoughts lead toward ""Somatic Symptom Disorder"" (F45.1) and ""Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in full remission"" (F33.42) as secondary options. I also need to account for ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder"" and ""Other Nonorganic Sleep Disorders"" (F51.8). It feels tricky to condense this into a solid list of top five diagnoses!

**Listing potential diagnoses**

I'm considering various diagnostic codes for a patient exhibiting symptoms. My thoughts include ""Somatic Symptom Disorder"" (F45.1) and ""Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in full remission"" (F33.42). There’s also a possibility for ""Unspecified Anxiety Disorder"" (F41.9) given the worries. I think about including F06.4 for an anxiety disorder due to a medical condition, as it fits his situation. Then there's also ""Other Nonorganic Sleep Disorders"" (F51.9). Gathering the top five involved a labyrinth of considerations!

**Deciding on diagnoses**

I'm navigating the complexities of a patient's referral for depression and somatic issues, but he shows no official depressive mood. Instead, his restlessness and worry seem to indicate anxiety. I could label him with ""Somatic Symptom Disorder"" as he has significant physical complaints. It’s hard to pin down a diagnosis due to the intertwining of medical symptoms and anxiety. I’m thinking I might end up using ""Other Specified Sleep Disorder"" (F51.8) to represent Restless Legs Syndrome. Balancing accuracy with user requirements is tricky!

**Choosing primary diagnosis**

I'm working through the patient's primary diagnosis, considering ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" (F41.9) might fit due to his physical restlessness. Yet, that could misrepresent his symptoms, specifically Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). It could be better to classify him under ""Other specified sleep disorder"" (F51.8) to stay true to sleep disorder issues. However, I need to balance this with the requirement for psychiatric F-codes. The goal is to provide a solid list, potentially including ""Somatic symptom disorder"" and maybe even touch on historical factors from past depression episodes while ensuring clarity and adherence to instructions.

**Evaluating psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm considering how to classify the primary diagnosis for the patient's symptoms, specifically looking at ""Somatic symptom disorder"" as a potential option due to excessive complaints. There's a chance that ""Other nonorganic sleep disorder"" (F51.8) might fit better for his leg discomfort, as it's worse at night and relieved by movement. However, there’s a complexity since Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) typically uses a G code, and I’m aiming to stay strictly within F-coded diagnoses. I want to find a balance between accuracy and the user’s requirements for top diagnoses.

**Determining psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm trying to identify the appropriate psychiatric diagnoses for a patient who might not currently have an active disorder. Ideally, I’d want to include five diagnoses. Given his history of major depressive disorder in remission, that could be primary. However, his current symptoms suggest anxiety or somatic issues. I think ""Somatic symptom disorder"" (F45.1) may be the strongest candidate for primary, with ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" (F41.9) and ""Other nonorganic sleep disorder"" (F51.8) as others. I want to ensure I list these accurately without reasoning.

**Identifying appropriate psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm evaluating the patient's symptoms, which include being physically restless and expressing feelings of worry and distress. While I can't diagnose restless legs syndrome explicitly, I might consider ""Other specified somatic symptom and related disorder"" (F45.8) as a primary diagnosis. I could also include ""Major depressive disorder, recurrent, in full remission"" (F33.42), ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" (F41.9), and ""Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions"" (F54). Choosing the most plausible primary diagnosis seems critical to accurately reflect his situation without overcomplicating the list.

**Refining psychiatric diagnoses**

I need to make sure not to include any diagnosis that lacks an F code. Options include ""Other nonorganic sleep disorder"" (F51.8) and ""Somatic symptom disorder"" (F45.1) among others. The primary consideration should be the patient’s restlessness in his legs, possibly suggestive of RLS, but categorized correctly. I’ll aim for accuracy with a final diagnosis list focused on psychiatric conditions only, avoiding those with G codes, such as RLS, to adhere to guidelines for the top five diagnoses.

**Choosing accurate diagnoses**

I need to ensure the diagnoses align with F codes while evaluating the patient's symptoms. I’ve considered various options like Somatic Symptom Disorder (F45.1) and Other nonorganic sleep disorder (F51.8). Given the patient’s leg discomfort, it seems most fitting to list Somatic Symptom Disorder as the primary diagnosis. I could consider Anxiety Disorder (F41.9) and Major Depressive Disorder (F33.42). Ultimately, I’m refining the list to capture the symptoms while adhering to the specified guidelines for psychiatric conditions.

**Clarifying F codes and diagnoses**

I’m navigating the complexities of F codes to see how they relate to possible diagnoses, particularly regarding Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). It seems like F51.8 might capture some elements of this condition, even if it feels a bit off. I’m thinking Somatic Symptom Disorder (F45.1) and Major Depressive Disorder (F33.42) could be strong candidates for the primary diagnosis. Given the patient's symptoms, I’m finalizing a list that ensures all selected diagnoses correspond to F codes, while also being mindful of any nuances in their clinical presentation.

**Ranking potential diagnoses**

I’m evaluating which diagnoses to include based on the patient's symptoms and history. Considering options like ""Other specified depressive disorder"" due to fatigue, I also think about including ""Major depressive disorder, recurrent, in remission."" The likelihood of diagnoses shifts depending on symptoms; so I’m focusing on those that best reflect his current condition. After careful consideration, I’m leaning towards using ""Other nonorganic sleep disorder"" as primary, followed by ""Somatic symptom disorder,"" ""Anxiety disorder,"" and so on. I’ll finalize the list based on current symptoms and their impact on treatment.

**Finalizing the diagnosis list**

I must choose exactly five diagnoses and order them appropriately. I'm considering codes like F51.8 for sleep disorders, F45.1 for somatic symptom disorder, and F41.9 for unspecified anxiety disorder. 

It’s tricky since I need to balance what's most relevant with what's permissible, especially given the patient's symptoms. ""Major depressive disorder, recurrent, in full remission"" seems appropriate, but blending that with a sleep disorder makes sense, too.

After some back-and-forth, I think the best set might include ""Other nonorganic sleep disorder"" as primary and then rank the rest based on likelihood. Let's finalize this!

**Selecting final diagnoses**

I’m debating whether to include “Illness anxiety disorder” or “Unspecified depressive disorder,” but that doesn’t seem right. I think “Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood” might fit due to dialysis stress but it's tricky without an onset date. I want a solid list of top five plausible diagnoses, looking at options like “Other specified sleep-wake disorder,” “Somatic symptom disorder,” and “Major depressive disorder, recurrent, in full remission.” Ultimately, I'm aiming for a list that truly reflects the patient's situation while sticking to the required F codes. Let's finalize it!

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

I’m thinking it’s best to label “Other specified sleep-wake disorder” with the code F51.8. While the DSM usually uses this phrase, I believe it will work here. I need to just present a clear list of five diagnoses. I'm debating which ones to include, like “Somatic symptom disorder” as secondary or primary, but I think primary should be the sleep disorder. Ultimately, my final list is going to clearly use relevant F codes. Let's deliver this!","1. Other specified sleep-wake disorder - F51.8

151,"Elizabeth Olsen and Finn Nelson presented for couples counseling in the context of increased arguments prior to their upcoming wedding. They were both successful attorneys in their late 30s. They had known each other since high school, had been dating for about 2 years, and planned to get married in about 6 months. Both denied ever having previously seen a therapist or received a psychiatric diagnosis.

The couples therapist met with them together for one session. Both Ms. Olsen and Mr. Nelson reported being very much in love and wanting the marriage to work out, but they also said that they were fighting much of the time. Ms. Olsen said she admired Mr. Nelson’s intelligence and steadiness and did not know why they fought. He, on the other hand, said he was still “totally infatuated” but upset about Ms. Olsen’s overall lack of interest in him. As the session neared a close, Mr. Nelson asked Ms. Olsen whether she wanted to bring up “the schedule, the alcohol, or the sex thing,” at which she smiled and said, “I’m afraid we’re out of time for today.”

The therapist met with each of them separately. At his meeting, Mr. Nelson said his biggest concern with Ms. Olsen was her lack of interest in sex. She seemed to go through the motions, he said, and always relied on alcohol. He worried that he was a “7 trying to date a 10” and that she just did not find him attractive. He was distressed about the fact that, try as he might, he was unable to bring her to orgasm or even to get her significantly aroused. This was, in turn, leading him to initiate sex less frequently, and even when he tried, he would “often just give up half-way through.” He had brought it up with her several times, but she had insisted that there was no problem. The therapist asked what he had meant by “the schedule thing.” He explained that since they had begun dating, she had limited their time together to one “school night,” usually a Tuesday, and then either a Friday or Saturday night. She had insisted that the schedule was necessary for her to complete her work and see her best girlfriends, but he had increasingly come to believe it was to avoid him.

In her individual session, Ms. Olsen said she was most frustrated by Mr. Nelson’s intensity and high desire for sex. She had set up their weekly schedule because otherwise he would want to constantly have sex with her. As it was, he wanted sex every time they got together, often twice in the same night. She readily admitted that she got drunk to tolerate intercourse. She added that she had used alcohol to numb herself since she began dating while in her teens. Until she had started dating Mr. Nelson, most of her sexual experiences had been “while drunk with strangers.” She had had a couple of boyfriends, but one was secretly gay and the other was “happy to get a blow job every now and then.” She had not told Mr. Nelson about these misadventures because she preferred that he continue to see her as “the near-virginal beauty queen.” Although alcohol made intercourse acceptable, “sexual arousal was almost never tolerable” and made her want to pass out. In recent months, Mr. Nelson had increasingly “forced the orgasm issue.” In the past, she would simply have broken up with any boyfriend who acted that way, but she believed she needed to stick it out because she was nearing 40 and this would be her “last chance to have a baby.” When asked why she thought she had these issues with sex, Ms. Olsen looked out the window for almost a minute and then answered, “I’m not going to tell you.”",Female sexual interest/arousal disorder,dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Considering criteria for diagnosis**

I need to be careful when evaluating this scenario. The term ""Alcohol use, unspecified"" isn't DSM-approved. DSM-5 mentions ""Alcohol use disorder"" but requires two criteria. I see potential points: recurrent use in hazardous situations, continued use despite interpersonal problems, and possibly self-medication to cope with sex. Those suggest extensive alcohol use, but it may not be inherently problematic. The user likely wants to focus on alcohol use disorder and related issues in Ms. Olsen's case.

**Evaluating possible diagnoses**

I’m contemplating different diagnoses like ""Other specified dissociative disorder"" or ""Dissociative symptoms."" The user’s desire to pass out when aroused might indicate dissociation or fainting, but there's no clear depersonalization. I wonder if ""Specific phobia"" or ""Alcohol-induced sexual dysfunction"" fits here since she relies on alcohol. It seems alcohol might reduce her arousal, making intercourse bearable. But her dysfunction appears present even without alcohol, suggesting she uses it as a coping mechanism. So, that complicates things a bit!

**Analyzing sexual dysfunction causes**

It seems she might only engage in sex while intoxicated, suggesting her sexual dysfunction could relate to alcohol usage. However, she describes her arousal as almost never tolerable, often making her want to pass out. This implies that while alcohol numbs her feelings, the dysfunction may stem from deeper psychological issues. I believe we should consider ""female sexual interest/arousal disorder"" as the primary concern. For Mr. Nelson, I think it fits better to focus on Ms. Olsen and create a structured list of relevant DSM-5-TR diagnoses.

**Identifying potential diagnoses**

In the context of couples therapy, I'm exploring various diagnoses like ""Female sexual interest/arousal disorder"" and possibly ""Alcohol use disorder,"" but I’m questioning their suitability in this case. I think the primary diagnosis should focus on sexual interest/arousal, and I need to ensure I include five diagnoses with F codes. I’m considering things like ""Other specified sexual dysfunction"" and examining the DSM-5-TR categories for relevant options, such as female orgasmic disorder, which relates to lack of orgasm. There’s a complex picture here!

**Determining potential diagnoses**

I'm exploring various diagnoses given the complexities of the case. While ""Female orgasmic disorder"" is possible, Ms. Olsen doesn't explicitly mention an inability to orgasm. Her low arousal might contribute to orgasm difficulties, suggesting a combination of ""sexual interest/arousal disorder"" and ""female orgasmic disorder."" I’m also considering potential trauma-related disorders and the impact of her alcohol use, but I'm wary of making assumptions without direct evidence. Additionally, I need to focus on providing five likely diagnoses, ensuring they reflect plausible clinical interpretations based on the information provided. There are subtle cues to evaluate, but I mustn't fabricate details.

**Clarifying diagnoses and coding**

I'm thoroughly considering what diagnoses to apply, especially for Mr. Nelson and Ms. Olsen. Without Mr. Nelson explicitly mentioning erectile issues, I’m hesitant to label him with specific disorders. Ms. Olsen’s patterns do suggest ""Alcohol use disorder,"" but I need to carefully choose the severity code. While F10.10 indicates mild alcohol use, I’m reflecting on her history and whether it leans more toward moderate use without overstepping. Balancing specifics with the requirement for DSM-5-TR codes gets tricky, particularly ensuring I don’t fabricate any details while accurately interpreting the nuances of their situations.

**Determining diagnoses and coding**

I’m trying to figure out the best diagnoses for Ms. Olsen and Mr. Nelson based on their presenting issues. Ms. Olsen might have ""Female sexual interest/arousal disorder,"" ""Alcohol use disorder,"" and ""Unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder."" For Mr. Nelson, I’m considering adjustments related to their relationship stress but need to ensure the diagnoses apply accurately. It's tricky since they both struggle with different dynamics. Ultimately, I want to select five clear diagnoses that reflect their complexities without overstating any issues or creating unsupported claims.

**Clarifying diagnoses and F-codes**

I'm considering the key diagnoses for Ms. Olsen. My top choices are: ""Female sexual interest/arousal disorder"" (F52.22), ""Alcohol use disorder"" (F10.10), ""Female orgasmic disorder"" (F52.31), ""Unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder"" (F43.9), and potentially ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" (F41.9). These all correspond with their symptom presentations. I want to ensure I'm adhering strictly to the relevant ICD-10 F-codes without introducing unnecessary options; clarity is key for effective communication.

**Identifying relevant diagnoses**

I'm narrowing down the top five psychiatric diagnoses for the vignette, ensuring they align with DSM-5 criteria and corresponding F-codes. Key choices are ""Female sexual interest/arousal disorder"" (F52.22), ""Alcohol use disorder"" (F10.10), ""Female orgasmic disorder"" (F52.31), and ""Unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder"" (F43.9). I need a fifth diagnosis, possibly ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety"" (F43.22) to reflect distress related to their relationship. I want to make sure we’re focusing on recognized issues while effectively capturing both individuals' experiences.

**Analyzing symptoms and diagnoses**

I'm parsing the symptoms related to Ms. Olsen's situation. She uses alcohol to cope with sexual experiences and has issues around arousal that could suggest ""Other specified sexual dysfunction"" (F52.8). ""Female sexual interest/arousal disorder"" (F52.22) might also apply, but she needs to exhibit more criteria. I see potential for both disorders. I'll note ""Alcohol use disorder"" (F10.10) and possibly PTSD (F43.10) as secondary diagnoses. I want to confirm ICD-10 codes accurately and prioritize those that align with her primary complaint about sexual dysfunction.

**Selecting top diagnoses**

I'm focusing on building a clear list of the top five diagnoses for Ms. Olsen. Possible options include ""Female sexual interest/arousal disorder"" and ""Alcohol use disorder."" Considering her reliance on alcohol and issues around arousal, I also think of ""Other specified sexual dysfunction"" and maybe ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety."" But I need to confirm that distress is present for these diagnoses to be valid. I think I should also consider ""Unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder"" as a potential fifth option. It's essential to be thorough but precise with these selections!

**Evaluating diagnoses**

I'm in the process of identifying the top diagnoses for this case, sorting through various possibilities like ""Female sexual interest/arousal disorder"" and ""Alcohol use disorder."" There's also potential for ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder"" and ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety."" I'm considering symptoms and whether they align with DSM criteria. It's essential to ensure that the chosen diagnoses reflect plausible issues without being overly speculative. I aim for a strong, coherent list while avoiding redundancy in diagnoses.

**Determining primary diagnoses**

I’m working on identifying the most appropriate diagnoses. It seems like ""Female sexual interest/arousal disorder"" (FSIAD) could be a primary diagnosis, but I’m still evaluating whether ""Other specified sexual dysfunction"" might capture the aversive aspects better. I'm considering including ""Alcohol use disorder"" and ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder"" as possibilities too. It's tricky because I want to avoid redundancy while ensuring the diagnoses are plausible and reflect the user's experiences accurately. Using trauma-related diagnoses seems important given the context, but I'm weighing a few options carefully.

**Deciding on secondary diagnoses**

For the fifth diagnosis, I’m weighing options like ""Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder"" and ""Adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct,"" but neither quite fits. I'm considering the male partner's characteristics like potential anxiety and insecurity, which could lead to including ""Other specified anxiety disorder."" He seems distressed due to the relationship. 

I want to finalize the list of top diagnoses, including ""Female sexual interest/arousal disorder"" and possibly ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety"" for both partners, reflecting their emotional and relational struggles effectively.

**Selecting appropriate diagnoses**

I’m contemplating whether to label the primary diagnosis as ""Other specified sexual dysfunction (sexual aversion)"" or stick with ""Female sexual interest/arousal disorder"" (FSIAD). Next, I need to choose secondary diagnoses. ""Alcohol use disorder"" seems like a fit, along with ""Unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder."" 

I aim to ensure that the top five diagnoses are well-supported. It’s critical to consider the nuances, such as the potential for trauma affecting the partner's distress, while keeping in mind possible comorbidity.

**Choosing diagnostic categories**

I’m trying to finalize the top five diagnoses. I think ""Female sexual interest/arousal disorder"" should be primary because it's highly likely. Next is ""Alcohol use disorder,"" which is moderate, followed by ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder."" 

For the fourth slot, I’m torn between possibly including ""Substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction"" due to alcohol usage or sticking with ""Unspecified anxiety disorder."" Lastly, we might consider ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety."" I need to ensure all chosen diagnoses align with DSM-5 standards, so I’ll carefully evaluate each option before settling on a list.

**Finalizing diagnostic codes**

I'm looking at the options for trauma and anxiety-related diagnoses. I’m considering ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder"" or keeping ""Unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder."" For anxiety, maybe ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" or ""Other specified anxiety disorder."" After thinking about the relationships between the conditions, I’m leaning toward:

1. Female sexual interest/arousal disorder - F52.22  
2. Alcohol use disorder - F10.10  
3. Unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder - F43.9  
4. Unspecified anxiety disorder - F41.9  
5. Adjustment disorder with anxiety - F43.22  

This covers the bases and adheres to the guidelines!

**Choosing supportive diagnoses**

I need to select diagnoses that are well-supported by the details we have. Here's what we know: the individual uses alcohol heavily to cope with sexual encounters, which is concerning. There’s also an unhealthy reaction to arousal, causing a desire to pass out, along with relationship conflict. This suggests possible trauma as the male partner shows distress. I think the key diagnoses are:

1. Female sexual interest/arousal disorder
2. Alcohol use disorder

Next, I'm considering:
3. Unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder
4. Unspecified anxiety disorder

As for the fifth diagnosis, it could be either Adjustment disorder with anxiety or other specified sexual dysfunction. I'm leaning toward Adjustment disorder due to related pre-wedding stress.

**Considering personality disorders**

I'm thinking about the possibility of labeling her condition as ""Other specified personality disorder"" with obsessive-compulsive personality traits. I notice she sets a schedule and prioritizes work while maintaining friendships, which might just be typical behavior for busy attorneys. Alternatively, maybe it fits into ""Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder"" (F60.5), but I realize I'm lacking enough information to confirm anything. It's a bit tricky to get it right without more details.

**Evaluating alcohol use criteria**

I’m considering the criteria for diagnosing alcohol use disorder. One possible criterion is continued use despite interpersonal problems. Another could be recurrent use leading to failure to fulfill role obligations, but I'm unsure if that applies here. She uses alcohol to numb psychological issues, which could point to a problem. Still, she might meet only one criterion, so a formal diagnosis might not be justified. Including ""Alcohol use, unspecified"" could be an option instead, but it’s different from DSM diagnosis.","1.

152,"Gerhard Palmer, a 55-year-old married accountant, presented to a psychiatrist for a second opinion in the context of recurrent major depressive disorder. He had not responded to two 3-month antidepressant trials, one with fluoxetine and another with sertraline, both at high dosages. At the time of his presentation, he had not taken any antidepressant medication since the trial with sertraline (about a month earlier).

The evaluation revealed a severely depressed man with profound psychomotor retardation, poor concentration, early insomnia, mildly diminished libido, and anhedonia. Mr. Palmer denied a substance use disorder, drank minimally, and did not smoke. He had started taking propranolol for hypertension about 6 months previously. His physical examination was unremarkable. Basic laboratory tests were within normal limits. His blood pressure was 135/85.

Treatment with clomipramine was initiated and was quickly increased, as tolerated, to the recommended maximum dosage of 250 mg/day. Buspirone 30 mg/day was added. After 5 weeks of treatment, Mr. Palmer reported feeling much improved. He was sleeping and eating well, was participating in enjoyable activities with increasing enthusiasm, and, for the first time in many months, felt a return of his sexual interest.

After not having had sexual intercourse in months, Mr. Palmer tried unsuccessfully to have sex several times. He was distressed to find that for the first time in his life, he was unable to maintain an erection during intercourse and was unable to ejaculate, even during masturbation. These problems persisted for a month. He recalled having had slightly delayed ejaculation while taking fluoxetine. He did not recall sexual problems during a prior trial of bupropion.","1. Medication-induced sexual dysfunction
2. Major depressive disorder, in full remission",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Exploring ICD-10 codes**

I'm checking my memory of ICD-10-CM codes for substance-related issues. I see codes like F10.10 for alcohol abuse and F10.120 for intoxication, but I'm considering other options. For substance-induced sexual dysfunction, maybe I should focus on specific dysfunction codes rather than substance category ones. There's F52.21 for erectile disorder, but it seems duration criteria might be an issue. I could look at F52.8 for ""other specified sexual dysfunction"" to better fit the situation.

**Clarifying diagnosis codes**

I’m looking into the F52.8 code, which is for sexual dysfunction not caused by substance use or a known physiological condition. In DSM, ""Other specified sexual dysfunction"" does cover situations not linked to substances. However, if the dysfunction is medication-induced, I should use a code for that instead. It seems I can apply F19.981 for medication-induced sexual dysfunction related to antidepressants. But is it right to use this F-code since the medication isn't an illicit substance? DSM notes the appropriate coding is tied to the substance class.

**Determining psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm wrestling with the coding again. There isn't a specific code for SSRIs, so I might go with F19.981 for substance-induced sexual dysfunction, plus an additional code for the medication's adverse effects, but that's a T-code and not allowed. So, F19.981 will have to do. The user has sexual interest but struggles with erectile and ejaculatory issues. For psychiatric diagnoses, ""Generalized anxiety disorder"" could fit, along with ""Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe without psychotic features"" as primary and substance-induced dysfunction as secondary. The other differentials seem less fitting given the situation.

**Refining diagnoses**

I'm considering ""Sexual dysfunction due to medication"" as a potential diagnosis, but it might overlap with other codes already discussed. I need to identify four secondary diagnoses, and while I could include comorbidities or differential diagnoses, they specifically asked for the top five most likely. I think ""Major depressive disorder, recurrent, in partial remission"" could work, but it feels tricky to classify both severe and partial remission at the same time. At evaluation, he is severely depressed, but he's improved post-treatment. Maybe I can use ""Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode, in partial remission"" to reflect his current state while noting that the sexual dysfunction persists.

**Finalizing psychiatric diagnoses**

The primary diagnosis seems to be Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), recurrent and currently in partial remission due to improvement from treatment. He's reporting sexual dysfunction while overall feeling better, showcasing possible residual effects. While he hasn't completely responded to previous medication trials, he has shown improvements. For secondary diagnoses, I should consider:

1. Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction (likely antidepressant-induced).
2. MDD, recurrent, in partial remission (F33.41).
3. Other specified sexual dysfunction (short duration).
4. Erectile disorder (F52.21) or delayed ejaculation (F52.32).

I’ll ensure the diagnoses follow the best evidence from the case while responding to the user's request.

**Structuring the diagnoses list**

I need to provide a structured list of the top five psychiatric diagnoses, even if some don’t fully meet the criteria. The primary diagnosis is likely Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), recurrent, severe without psychotic features. For secondary diagnoses, I can include:

1. Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction (likely antidepressant-related).
2. Other specified sexual dysfunction (F52.8).
3. Erectile disorder (F52.21).
4. Delayed ejaculation (F52.32).
5. Possibly Insomnia disorder (F51.01). 

I'll ensure these fit the criteria based on the information provided.

**Finalizing the diagnoses list**

I’m considering the patient's depression situation; he didn’t respond to two SSRIs, indicating treatment-resistant depression. He’s on propranolol, which can cause sexual dysfunction. His sexual problems seem linked to clomipramine. I'll aim to finalize five DSM-5-TR diagnoses. The main diagnoses I want to include are:

1. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, severe.
2. Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction.
3. Other specified sexual dysfunction (short duration).
4. Delayed ejaculation.
5. Erectile disorder.

I need to prioritize plausible diagnoses based on his symptoms and current medications.

**Refining sexual dysfunction diagnoses**

I need to include various sexual dysfunction diagnoses related to the patient's medication. The main points to consider are that his sexual dysfunction onset coincided with clomipramine use. Although he's feeling better, he faces distress from erectile issues and inability to ejaculate. For the DSM-5 diagnoses, I'll focus on:

1. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, severe without psychotic features (F33.2).
2. Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction (F19.981).
3. Erectile Disorder (provisional).
4. Delayed Ejaculation (provisional).
5. Other specified sexual dysfunction (short duration).

I’ll prioritize these based on relevant symptoms and medication history.

**Exploring ICD-10 codes for sexual dysfunction**

I’m diving into the ICD-10 codes related to substance-induced and medication-related sexual dysfunction. For alcohol, I recall F10.181, while opioid-related might be F11.24 for mood disorders. Antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction could use F19.981 since antidepressants fit under ""other psychoactive substances."" The primary diagnoses for the patient could be Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent and severe (F33.2), with medication-induced sexual dysfunction as a secondary diagnosis. Additionally, I’m considering including male erectile disorder and delayed ejaculation as possible differentials. Let’s finalize these choices.

**Differentiating ICD-10 codes**

I'm digging into the differences between ICD-10 and ICD-10-CM codes. The specificity in the ICD-10-CM codes helps identify sexual dysfunction, like F52.21 for male erectile disorder and F52.31 for female orgasmic disorder. For diagnoses, I’m considering Major Depressive Disorder (F33.2) and Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction (F19.981) as primary. I’ll definitely aim for five plausible F-coded diagnoses while avoiding any less likely options, ensuring they align with the DSM-5 criteria. Prioritizing these diagnoses will help clarify the complexities involved.

**Identifying diagnoses for sexual dysfunction**

I'm focusing on Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction, likely from clomipramine (F19.981). For a thorough list, I’m looking at:

1. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe without psychotic features - F33.2
2. Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction - F19.981
3. Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) - F34.1
4. Bipolar II disorder - F31.81
5. Other specified sexual dysfunction (short duration) - F52.8 or Erectile disorder - F52.21.

I need to prioritize the most relevant diagnoses and ensure they're appropriately coded.

**Clarifying potential diagnoses**

I’m exploring codes related to substance-induced mood disorders. F19.94 applies for unspecified substance use with mood disorder, but the patient is actually taking medication. We could use F19.981 for Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction. 

Here's the list I’m considering:
1. Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode, severe without psychotic features - F33.2
2. Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction - F19.981
3. Bipolar II disorder - F31.81
4. Depressive disorder due to another medical condition - F06.31
5. Other specified sexual dysfunction - F52.8 

I’m balancing relevance and accuracy for credible diagnoses.

**Determining the best diagnoses**

I’m trying to finalize a list of five diagnoses related to this case. The primary diagnosis is Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with the code F33.2. For secondary diagnoses, I'm considering including Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction (F19.981), along with possible options like Erectile Disorder (F52.21) and Delayed Ejaculation (F52.32).

I might also add Bipolar II Disorder (F31.81) or Depressive Disorder due to another medical condition (F06.31)—even though these may not be as certain. Ultimately, I need to ensure these choices fit the context accurately.

**Finalizing the diagnosis list**

I’m working on defining the top five psychiatric diagnoses, starting with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) as the primary diagnosis, which gets the code F33.2. For the secondary diagnoses, I’m considering Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction (F19.981), as this seems relevant due to medication use.

Erectile Disorder (F52.21) and Delayed Ejaculation (F52.32) are also possibilities but may not fully apply due to the medication. Still, the plan is to include them as differentials. Lastly, I might consider Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (F19.94) to reflect the patient's history with medication.

**Crafting the diagnosis list**

I'm sorting through the patient's diagnoses, particularly focusing on their recurrent Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Including both MDD and medication-induced depressive disorder seems tricky since they're mutually exclusive. I know I need to create a top five list, which should encompass the primary diagnosis and four relevant secondary ones.

I've settled on:

1. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, severe without psychotic features (F33.2).
2. Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction (F19.981).
3. Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (F19.94).
4. Erectile Disorder (F52.21).
5. Delayed Ejaculation (F52.32).

While I’m unsure about the nuances of codes, I think this captures the patient’s situation well.

**Refining the diagnosis list**

I'm considering whether to include ""Other specified sexual dysfunction (short duration)"" in my list of diagnoses, but it doesn't quite fit since its criteria exclude medication as the cause. I’ve settled on a top five that reflects the complexities of this case. 

My proposed diagnoses are:

1. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, severe without psychotic features - F33.2.
2. Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction - F19.981.
3. Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (considering propranolol’s role) - F19.94.
4. Erectile Disorder - F52.21.
5. Delayed Ejaculation - F52.32.

This selection captures the core issues while acknowledging potential differentials.

**Finalizing the diagnosis list**

I’m now putting together the final list of diagnoses considering the current evidence. I’m including ""Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction"" because it reflects symptoms linked to medication use. 

My proposed top five are:

1. Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode, severe without psychotic features - F33.2.
2. Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction, with erectile and orgasmic symptoms - F19.981.
3. Erectile disorder - F52.21.
4. Delayed ejaculation - F52.32.
5. Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (possibly medication-related) - F19.94.

I believe this captures the complexities of his case effectively.

**Considering depression diagnosis**

I'm evaluating whether to classify his primary diagnosis as major depressive disorder (MDD), specifically recurrent and possibly in partial remission. The context of his improvement after treatment is essential. It seems he has shown some positive changes, yet not whether he's fully symptom-free.

I'll land on F33.2, reflecting MDD, recurrent episode, severe without psychotic features, since severe depression was present during evaluation. However, I might also consider F33.41 for partial remission, reflecting current improvement but not full recovery. The key is to balance his state at the time of dysfunction while acknowledging past severity.

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

He reported feeling much improved after five weeks, though some residual depression might still be present. Given his improved sleep, appetite, and return of sexual interest, I believe partial remission is a better classification than full. For the primary diagnosis, I’m considering ""Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode, severe without psychotic features"" as most fitting. 

I’m finalizing the structured diagnosis list with proper codes, ensuring I avoid adding unnecessary text or detail. Here’s the final output:

1. Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode, severe without psychotic features - F33.2  
2. Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction (onset after medication use) - F19.981

153,"Irene Rohmer, a 25-year-old salesperson, presented to a psychiatrist because of anxiety and depression. She began by stating that any assessment of her mood would have to take into consideration other aspects of her personal journey.

Ms. Rohmer had been born without complications, assigned male at birth, and raised as a boy. As long as she could remember, she had been teased and called a “sissy” by neighborhood boys. She had generally preferred the company of girls throughout childhood. During her teen years, she continued to have many female friends but considered herself a gay male and dated a few other gay teens. She recalled trying her best to “fit in” but noted that she had always felt like an outsider.

At age 19, during a romantic relationship with a man, she become aware of an intense desire to be a woman. That relationship ended, but Ms. Rohmer’s desire to be a woman evolved into a strong sense that she had been born as the wrong gender. She tried to figure out whether this sense had existed earlier, but all she could recall was occasionally wishing she were a girl to fit in more comfortably with her friends.

By age 20, Ms. Rohmer was very unhappy about being seen as a man. She viewed her genitalia as “repugnant” and a “mistake of nature.” Her family and some of her friends had not supported her developing sense of herself, and she recalled feeling increasingly hopeless, with episodic suicidal ideation and one nonlethal suicide attempt by overdose at age 21.

Beginning at age 22, Ms. Rohmer lived as a female, including changing her name and exclusively wearing women’s clothes. She struggled to access appropriate health services and encountered multiple barriers to obtaining appropriate treatments, but, at the age of 24, Ms. Rohmer was evaluated by two psychiatrists skilled in transgender health, who agreed with her perspective, and she started gender-affirming hormone therapy.

As her transition progressed, she began to feel more comfortable in the female role and pleased with having secondary sexual characteristics that were more consistent with her experienced gender. She explored her sexuality during this time, dating both gay and straight men. Her anxiety diminished, although, as a member of a disenfranchised subgroup, she felt vulnerable to various types of aggression, including potential partner violence.

The following year, at age 25, Ms. Rohmer had the gender on her driver’s license and passport changed from male to female (a change of gender markers) and underwent gender-affirming surgeries that included vaginoplasty and breast augmentation. The results of these surgeries were satisfactory, and she was often happy with the transition. She described herself as being “more comfortable in her skin” than she had ever been, and she only infrequently felt hopeless and suicidal. Despite not feeling particularly accepted by her family of origin or by some of her old friends, she found warm support from other friends and colleagues at work. Although she has many friends who are gender nonbinary/gender nonconforming, Ms. Rohmer identifies as a heterosexual female.

She said she tended to worry that people were judging her negatively, but this worry was less intense now than it had been earlier in her transition. She denied any recent suicide attempts, depression, or self-injurious behavior. She said she had “almost” given up on having a successful relationship but was “somehow” still optimistic that something would work out.","Gender dysphoria, posttransition",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Listing potential diagnoses**

The user wants the top 5 most likely diagnoses, focusing on presenting them rather than differential reasoning. It’s crucial to ensure we highlight diagnoses that may coexist since some could be mutually exclusive and cause confusion. For instance, Major Depressive Disorder might co-occur with gender dysphoria and anxiety-related disorders. I’ll also consider using ""Unspecified Depressive Disorder"" instead of adjustment disorder, ensuring I include four secondary diagnoses that can be provisional or in remission.

**Considering potential diagnoses**

I’m thinking I should include various diagnoses. I have Gender Dysphoria, Major Depressive Disorder (single episode, in partial remission), Social Anxiety Disorder, and possibly Generalized Anxiety Disorder or something unspecified. To fill in the fifth, I’m considering using ""Unspecified Anxiety Disorder"" instead of GAD. While I could add ""Other Specified Depressive Disorder (subthreshold related to minority stress),"" it might feel redundant alongside MDD. ""Body Dysmorphic Disorder"" could be relevant due to her negative perception of genitalia, but that might overlap with gender dysphoria.

**Evaluating potential diagnoses**

It seems like Body Dysmorphic Disorder isn't the best fit because her perceived incongruence isn’t a defect but relates more to gender identity. Persistent Depressive Disorder could be considered due to long-term hopelessness, but it doesn’t quite fit. I’m weighing options like ""Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety,"" which might be appropriate given her distress linked to transition and discrimination. This could explain earlier anxiety and depression without meeting full criteria for Major Depressive Disorder, especially since she has experienced suicidality.

**Evaluating adjustment disorder**

I’m considering her long-term distress, which might complicate the use of ""Adjustment Disorder,"" since that typically resolves within six months after the stressor ends. In her case, the ongoing stressor seems to relate to her dysphoria and support issues, persisting until around age 22. Although there is a “chronic” adjustment disorder specifier in DSM-5, it seems like I should focus on ""Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood,"" but if Major Depressive Disorder better explains her symptoms, then it's not needed.

**Determining top diagnoses**

I'm refining potential diagnoses for the user’s case. The primary diagnosis is likely to be Gender Dysphoria, with secondary ones including Major Depressive Disorder (single episode, in partial remission) and Social Anxiety Disorder. I’m considering whether to use Generalized Anxiety Disorder or Unspecified Anxiety Disorder and possibly Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, especially relating to discrimination. It’s important to have a comprehensive list, but not over-diagnose. So, I think the leading five would be Gender Dysphoria, Major Depressive Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, Adjustment Disorder, and Unspecified Anxiety Disorder.

**Finalizing potential diagnoses**

I’m thinking about the primary and secondary diagnoses for this case. The main diagnosis is likely Gender Dysphoria, and for the secondary ones, I’m considering Unspecified Anxiety Disorder and Unspecified Depressive Disorder, as they help capture symptoms without needing full criteria. Other options include Social Anxiety Disorder and Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, which could overlap. I'll prioritize my list based on the most likely diagnoses, ensuring to provide the appropriate F codes. Here’s the ranking I’m settling on:

1. Gender Dysphoria - F64.1  
2. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder - F41.9  
3. Unspecified Depressive Disorder - F32.9  
4. Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood - F43.23  
5. Social Anxiety Disorder - F40.10

**Refining diagnoses based on symptoms**

I’m considering how to approach the diagnoses based on the information available. Given the presence of hopelessness and suicidal ideation, it seems appropriate to include Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), but there isn’t sufficient confirmation on duration or the full range of symptoms required for a definitive diagnosis. So, I might lean toward Unspecified Depressive Disorder instead. I'll include Gender Dysphoria as the primary diagnosis, alongside other potential diagnoses like Social Anxiety Disorder and Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood. 

Here’s the structured list I’m finalizing:

1. Gender Dysphoria in Adolescents and Adults - F64.1  
2. Major Depressive Disorder (if considered) - F32.4  
3. Social Anxiety Disorder - F40.10  
4. Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood - F43.23  
5. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder - F41.9

**Finalizing diagnoses based on criteria**

I think the best approach here is to use unspecified categories since they allow for partial criteria while still being accurate. For instance, ""Unspecified Depressive Disorder"" applies when symptoms are present but full criteria aren't met, which fits given the lack of details about the severity. 

I'll finalize the diagnoses list, ensuring that all entries are F-coded. My final list includes:

1. Gender Dysphoria in Adolescents and Adults - F64.1  
2. Unspecified Depressive Disorder - F32.9  
3. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder - F41.9  
4. Social Anxiety Disorder - F40.10  
5. Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood - F43.23  

This way, I’m capturing all relevant aspects without confusion.

**Assessing current diagnosis of gender dysphoria**

In this case, it seems that the patient's happiness and comfort after transition might indicate that her gender dysphoria has resolved. But, she still identifies as transgender, and there could be residual distress tied to social judgment, which complicates the diagnosis. Although she no longer meets the criteria for gender dysphoria as distress is key, I think it’s still relevant to include it due to her history and ongoing needs for mental health support.

I believe the primary diagnosis should still be gender dysphoria, considering her journey and continued support needs.

**Finalizing diagnoses list**

It seems we need to be cautious about how we present the diagnosis of gender dysphoria given that the patient may no longer meet the criteria currently. While it's important to acknowledge her past diagnosis, if she’s feeling more comfortable now, we could consider labeling it as ""Gender dysphoria in remission."" For secondary diagnoses, I’m leaning toward including unspecified anxiety disorder, unspecified depressive disorder, social anxiety disorder, and adjustment disorder. 

However, I have to prioritize the most relevant conditions, ultimately leading to a finalized diagnosis list.

**Deciding final diagnoses**

As I consider the appropriate diagnoses, I could designate ""Social Anxiety Disorder"" as primary and list ""Gender Dysphoria in Adolescents and Adults, in remission"" as secondary. Yet, I’m leaning towards keeping gender dysphoria as the primary focus since it plays a critical role in the case narrative, despite her current anxiety and depression. 

The finalized diagnoses will need to reflect the most relevant conditions, including F-codes like Major Depressive Disorder and Adjustment Disorder, while avoiding unnecessary redundancy. So here's what I’m contemplating for my final list.

**Choosing final diagnoses**

The vignette suggests she dealt with past depression and anxiety, which has likely improved, but anxiety persists. I’m weighing whether to classify social anxiety or unspecified anxiety as second. Since her main complaints revolve around anxiety and depression, these should indeed be reflected in the diagnoses. 

I’m finalizing my list, ensuring adherence to the DSM-5-TR codes. I believe the diagnoses from gender dysphoria to adjustment disorder offer a comprehensive overview of her situation while balancing historical severity with current symptoms.

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

I'm considering potential diagnoses and confirming that the primary diagnosis should be ""Gender Dysphoria in Adolescents and Adults."" For secondary diagnoses, I'm thinking about including ""Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, in partial remission"" as well as social anxiety, adjustment disorder, and unspecified anxiety. I’ve verified the corresponding ICD-10 codes, and I’m now formatting the final list according to the user's instructions, ensuring everything is organized clearly without additional commentary. Here’s the finalized output:

154,"Kyle was a 12-year-old boy who reluctantly agreed to admission to a psychiatric unit after getting arrested for breaking into a grocery store. His mother said she was “exhausted,” adding that it was hard to raise a boy who “doesn’t know the rules.”

Beginning as a young child, Kyle was unusually aggressive, bullying other children and taking their things. When confronted by his mother, stepfather, or a teacher, he had long tended to curse, punch, and show no concern for possible punishment. Disruptive, impulsive, and “fidgety,” Kyle was diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and placed in a special education program by second grade. He began to see a psychiatrist in fourth grade for weekly psychotherapy and medications (quetiapine and dexmethylphenidate). He was adherent only sporadically with both the medication and the therapy. When asked why this was, he replied that his psychiatrist was “stupid.”

During the year prior to the admission, he had been caught stealing from school lockers (a cell phone, a jacket, a laptop computer), disciplined after “mugging” a classmate for his wallet, and suspended after multiple physical fights with classmates. He had been arrested twice for these behaviors. His mother and teachers agreed that although he could be charming to strangers, people quickly caught on to the fact that he was a “con artist.” Kyle was consistently unremorseful, externalizing of blame, and uninterested in the feelings of others. He was disorganized, was inattentive and uninterested in following instructions, and constantly lost his possessions. He generally did not do his homework, and when he did, his performance was erratic. When confronted about his poor performance, he tended to say, “And what are you going to do, shoot me?” Kyle, his mother, and his teachers agreed that he was a loner and not well liked by his peers.

Kyle lived with his mother, stepfather, and two younger half-siblings. His stepfather was unemployed, and his mother worked part-time as a cashier in a grocery store. His biological father was in prison for drug possession. Both biological grandfathers had a history of alcohol use disorder.

Kyle’s early history was normal. The pregnancy was uneventful, and he reached all of his milestones on time. There was no history of sexual or physical abuse. Kyle had no known medical problems, alcohol or substance abuse, or participation in gang activities. He had not been caught with weapons, had not set fires, and had not been seen as particularly cruel to other children or animals. He had been regularly truant from school but had neither run away nor stayed away from home until late at night.

When interviewed on the psychiatric unit, Kyle was casually groomed and appeared his stated age of 12. He was fidgety and made sporadic eye contact with the interviewer. He said he was “mad” and insisted he would rather be in jail than on a psychiatric unit. His speech was loud but coherent, goal directed, and of normal rate. His affect was irritable and angry. He denied suicidal or homicidal ideation. He denied psychotic symptoms. He denied feeling depressed. He had no obvious cognitive deficits but declined more formal testing. His insight was limited, and his judgment was poor by history.","1. Conduct disorder, childhood-onset type, severe, with limited prosocial emotions
2. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Evaluating psychiatric diagnoses**

I’m working through an exam instruction that asks for a structured list of DSM-5-TR diagnoses based on a clinical vignette. They specify that I need to give the top five most likely diagnoses, which could include primary and secondary diagnoses that are comorbid. It seems I should avoid unsupported diagnoses, so I definitely won’t include DMDD. I can consider diagnoses like ""Conduct disorder with limited prosocial emotions,"" ""ADHD combined type,"" and maybe ""Other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder.""

**Choosing appropriate diagnoses**

I'm sorting through which diagnoses to include for this task. I can think about using “Other specified personality disorder” or “Parent-child relational problem,” but I need to avoid F-codes. I must include five diagnoses without fabricating, so I might go with plausible comorbid conditions. 

""Conduct disorder"" and ""ADHD"" could be great options. I might add ""Oppositional defiant disorder"" since defiance is evident. However, I’ll skip ""Specific learning disorder"" and ""Unspecified mood disorder,"" keeping it focused on supported diagnoses.

**Determining appropriate diagnoses**

I’m considering whether to include ""Other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder"" for proposed traits like callousness. I might also look into diagnoses like ""ADHD"" and ""Conduct disorder,"" as well as ""Oppositional defiant disorder.” However, I’m unsure about including others like anxiety or trauma-related disorders. 

One possibility is to consider ""Childhood-onset conduct disorder, severe, with limited prosocial emotions"" as the primary diagnosis, followed by ""ADHD, combined presentation” and possibly ""Other specified personality disorder,"" even though he’s only 12. I’m puzzled about the guidelines on diagnosing personality disorders in children.

**Analyzing personality disorder criteria**

I’m delving into the DSM-5 criteria, which state that an enduring pattern of behavior can be diagnosed as a personality disorder (PD), even in adolescents, as long as it’s been present for at least a year—except for antisocial PD. So, could I consider ""Other specified personality disorder"" with antisocial features? I wonder if that would contradict the rules against labeling antisocial PD. 

It seems like this could work as long as it's causing impairment but doesn't meet the full criteria. But diagnosing could be risky. Other options like ""Unspecified disruptive disorder"" don't seem suitable either.

**Listing diagnoses clearly**

I’m focusing on naming the specific diagnoses correctly for clarity. I’ll include: Conduct Disorder, childhood-onset type, with limited prosocial emotions; Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, combined presentation; Oppositional Defiant Disorder; Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder; and Intermittent Explosive Disorder. 

This structured approach should help present the information effectively. Now, it’s time to deliver this list in a clear manner for better understanding. I’m feeling positive about getting it right!","1. Conduct Disorder, childhood-onset type (with limited prosocial emotions) - F91.1

155,"Lucas Sandahl, a 32-year-old landscape architect, presented to a psychiatrist for help with anger. He came to the office with his wife, the mother of their two young children. The couple agreed that Mr. Sandahl had become “almost impossible to live with.” Mrs. Sandahl reported that although she had always considered her husband “high-strung,” his outbursts were increasing in both frequency and intensity, and she worried that he would become violent with her.

Their most recent argument began when Mr. Sandahl came home after a “hard day at work” to find that dinner was not ready. When he entered the kitchen and saw his wife sitting at the table reading the newspaper, he “exploded” and launched into a tirade about how “bad” a wife she was. When Mrs. Sandahl tried to explain her own long day, Mr. Sandahl cursed at her and broke glassware and a kitchen chair. Terrified, she ran out of the kitchen, gathered up the toddlers, and left for her mother’s house a few miles away. The next day, she told her husband that he would need to get help immediately or prepare for a divorce.

Mr. Sandahl said his “blowups” began in childhood but did not become “problematic” for him until age 13. At about that time, he started having frequent fights with classmates that would occasionally result in trips to the principal’s office. In between the altercations, he was active socially and a solid student.

Mr. Sandahl estimated that he had had approximately four verbal outbursts a week in recent years, generally in response to frustration, unexpected demands, or perceived insults. In addition to these heated verbal tussles, Mr. Sandahl described acts of violence about every 2 months; for example, he threw a computer monitor across the room when it started “acting up,” he kicked a hole in a wall when one of his children would not quit crying, and he destroyed his mobile phone during an argument with his mother. He denied physical fights since his adolescence, although he had nearly come to blows with a neighbor as well as an assortment of strangers and employees. The idea that he might physically hurt someone scared Mr. Sandahl “to the core.”

These outbursts blighted his relationships with colleagues and romantic partners and led to his decision to start his own landscaping company at age 25. The business had done well, despite his demanding style and “hair-trigger” temper that led to high employee turnover.

Mr. Sandahl described the episodes as short-lived, reaching a peak within seconds and rarely lasting more than a few minutes. Between episodes, he described himself as feeling “fine.” He had experienced brief periods of depressed mood and increased anxiety, but these had not impaired him significantly and tended to resolve on their own within a week. Mr. Sandahl drank socially, but neither he nor his wife linked the outbursts to the alcohol. He had a history of experimentation with various drugs of abuse, but not in recent years.

Mr. Sandahl reported at least two other immediate family members with significant “anger issues.” His father was emotionally abusive and perfectionistic, expecting “great things” from his only son. Mr. Sandahl’s older sister also had problems with her temper; he attributed her three divorces to her emotionally abusive behavior.

On examination, Mr. Sandahl was casually dressed, cooperative, and coherent. He was worried about his behavior and contrite toward his wife. He denied depression, psychosis, and confusion. He denied any thoughts of hurting himself or others. He was cognitively intact. His insight and judgment were good during the course of the interview.",Intermittent explosive disorder,dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Evaluating Diagnoses Options**

I need to come up with five diagnoses, starting with ""Intermittent explosive disorder."" I can list possible rule-out diagnoses like ""Bipolar disorder, unspecified,"" ""Borderline personality disorder,"" ""Antisocial personality disorder,"" and ""Substance/medication-induced bipolar disorder."" However, these may not be likely. I should evaluate each diagnosis for the patient, considering features like episodic irritability and the duration of symptoms—especially since bipolar and borderline features may not fully apply here. Let’s explore that further!

**Analyzing Potential Diagnoses**

In this case, the patient shows anger outbursts and relationship issues, but there's no evidence of self-harm, suicidality, or identity disturbance. Borderline personality disorder could be a consideration, but it’s not strongly supported.  

I’m thinking about narcissistic personality disorder, as his rage may stem from perceived insults and expectations. However, that doesn’t seem robust either. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder might fit due to rigidity, but his explosive reactions indicate something different. ADHD is a possibility, but he doesn't show typical symptoms. Substance use disorder, PTSD, and conduct disorder don’t apply here either. I need to evaluate further!

**Considering Diagnoses**

I’m contemplating whether the patient might have ""Intermittent explosive disorder"" and ""Persistent depressive disorder,"" but that doesn't fit well. Based on limited information, I think four possible secondary diagnoses could be: 1) Intermittent explosive disorder; 2) Unspecified personality disorder; 3) Unspecified depressive disorder; 4) Unspecified anxiety disorder; and maybe even 5) mild alcohol use disorder or cannabis use disorder in remission. However, I realize that alcohol use isn’t supported. 

In the end, I need to focus on the top five diagnoses with proper F-codes. I’m thinking:

1. Intermittent Explosive Disorder - F63.81 
2. Unspecified Personality Disorder - F60.9 
3. Other Specified Depressive Disorder - F32.8 
4. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder - F41.8 
5. Alcohol Use Disorder, mild - F10.10, although I might consider alternatives if needed!

**Selecting Appropriate Diagnoses**

I’m thinking I should focus on diagnoses that have some supporting evidence. Maybe he fits ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder"" due to his emotionally abusive father, but there aren't really any clear symptoms for that. I also consider ""Unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder"" (F43.9), but that would need trauma-related symptoms, which don't really seem to apply here. ""Parent-child relational problem"" is a Z code, and I can't include non-psychiatric diagnoses without F-codes.  

He does display traits like being ""high-strung"" and having a ""hair-trigger temper,"" which aligns with ""Intermittent Explosive Disorder"" (IED) and potentially ""Personality disorder trait of anger."" I also think about ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder,"" but he doesn’t mention much excessive worry, and his anxiety episodes are brief, so that probably isn’t a fit either. It’s a bit tricky!

**Identifying Potential Diagnoses**

I’m considering whether the patient could have ""Cyclothymic disorder"" or ""Other specified bipolar disorder,"" but he doesn’t show signs of hypomanic episodes—just depression and anxiety. ""Other specified depressive disorder"" seems more plausible, or maybe even ""Major depressive disorder,"" although there’s no clear evidence for that either.  

He expresses worries about becoming violent, which seems more like anxiety than a disorder. While there are familial anger issues suggesting he might have ""Narcissistic personality traits,"" it doesn’t quite fit. ""Intermittent explosive disorder"" is possible but I need to list proper diagnoses and their codes. 

I’m confirming:
- Intermittent explosive disorder: F63.81
- Borderline personality disorder: F60.3
- Narcissistic personality disorder: F60.81
- Antisocial personality disorder: F60.2
- Bipolar disorder, unspecified: F31.9

I’m feeling a bit mixed up with the depressive disorder codes too, especially between DSM-5 and ICD-10 mappings!

**Reviewing depressive disorder codes**

I'm recalling that the DSM-5 uses ICD-10-CM codes. For unspecified depressive disorder, the DSM-5 code is 311 (F32.9), but major depressive disorder has F32.* codes. I think the unspecified depressive disorder might really be F32.9. The DSM-5-TR has updated to align with ICD-10-CM changes, possibly making it F32.A. Other specified depressive disorder seems to use F32.8 or F32.89, while unspecified anxiety disorder is F41.9, and other specified anxiety disorders are F41.8.

**Identifying psychiatric diagnoses**

For other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorders, I believe the code is F43.8, while the unspecified code is F43.9. For personality disorders, unspecified is F60.9 and other specified is F60.89. Narcissistic personality disorder is coded F60.81, borderline personality is F60.3, and antisocial is F60.2. I checked that intermittent explosive disorder is indeed F63.81. Now I need to list the top 5 DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses using F-codes. I'm considering:  

1. Intermittent Explosive Disorder - F63.81  
2. Other Specified Depressive Disorder - F32.8  
3. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder - F41.8  
4. Unspecified Personality Disorder - F60.9  
5. Alcohol Use Disorder - F10.90 (not sure about this).

**Evaluating depressive and anxiety disorders**

I'm considering that depression and anxiety might not be significantly impairing, but they could still be present in brief episodes. The question is about listing DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses that would fit. He claims these episodes haven’t caused significant impairment. The DSM does require clinically significant distress or impairment for diagnosis, so if there’s no significant impairment, that complicates things. However, the presence of symptoms might still warrant some diagnosis, like “Unspecified Depressive Disorder” as a potential differential.

**Selecting differential diagnoses**

I'm thinking we should focus on differential diagnoses related to anger, which might include: 

1. Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED)  
2. Borderline Personality Disorder  
3. Antisocial Personality Disorder  
4. Bipolar Disorder, Unspecified  
5. Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar Disorder or Alcohol Use Disorder.  

It's important to evaluate which ones make the most sense based on what we know. For example, his outbursts could connect with IED or narcissistic traits, as he seems contrite yet demanding. I’ll need to weigh the plausibility of each as we narrow it down.

**Determining top psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm trying to decide on relevant diagnoses based on the presence of anger and impulsivity. Intermittent Explosive Disorder (F63.81) seems primary, while borderline personality disorder (F60.3) and narcissistic personality disorder (F60.81) might also be relevant due to relationship instability and rage. Bipolar disorder (F31.9) could be possible too, alongside ADHD (F90.2) for impulsivity from childhood.

I’m considering other factors, like the presence of substance use, but it seems less linked. Ultimately, my differential list might look like this:

1. Intermittent Explosive Disorder
2. Personality disorder with impulsivity features 
3. Bipolar disorder, unspecified
4. ADHD, unspecified
5. Alcohol Use Disorder, mild.

**Clarifying diagnostic concerns**

I’m feeling a bit uneasy about possibly ""fabricating"" diagnoses for depressive or anxiety disorders since the case mentions minimal impairment. I can interpret ""not impaired significantly"" as needing to meet specific criteria for clinical significance, which might not be met with minimal impairment. Personality disorders also need a pervasive pattern, which isn't described. Still, I'll focus on providing the top 5 most likely diagnoses without any disclaimers since the user seems to want a differential list.

**Organizing psychiatric diagnoses**

In typical exam tasks, they often ask for a differential diagnosis and to list the top 5. Here, they're requesting a structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses along with the top 5 most likely ones, which suggests we can include rule-outs. I think we should pick four alternative diagnoses based on the case. I see Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) as primary. For differentials: Bipolar disorder can involve irritability and aggression; personality disorders like borderline, antisocial, and narcissistic need to be differentiated based on anger outbursts.

**Assessing potential diagnoses**

In this case, the individual shows remorse and episodic aggression, with less focus on personality disorders. Substance or medication use could be factors, given past experimentation, but there's no clear link. ADHD or other neurodevelopmental disorders might explain emotional impulsivity, but there's insufficient evidence. Autism and intellectual disabilities seem unlikely. Posttraumatic stress disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder don’t fit either. Major depressive disorder is present but brief. Therefore, potential secondaries could include borderline personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder, unspecified bipolar disorder, or unspecified ADHD. IED seems most likely due to recurrent aggressive outbursts, with borderline PD also relevant but not primary.

**Choosing appropriate diagnoses**

Narcissistic personality disorder (PD) can involve rage and abusive behavior, while antisocial PD entails aggression and impulsivity; however, the individual shows remorse and no criminal history. ADHD also involves impulsivity but doesn’t seem to fit here. Substance-induced conditions are possible, but he denies any link. So, I’m considering options: Borderline PD, Narcissistic PD, Unspecified ADHD, and Unspecified Bipolar disorder. However, since both borderline and narcissistic are personality disorders, I might use “Other specified personality disorder” as a catch-all for traits without mislabeling. Plus, we could include a mood disorder and ADHD as well.

**Deciding on secondary diagnoses**

I need to identify four secondary diagnoses. Options include Other Specified Personality Disorder (F60.89), Unspecified ADHD (F90.9), Unspecified Bipolar Disorder (F31.9), and possibly Substance-Induced Bipolar Disorder, though that feels uncertain since there's no specific code for impulsive aggressive disorder. Another differential could be Adjustment Disorder with mixed disturbance (F43.25), but his history is long. Since impairment isn't significant, I'll list the following top five:

1. Intermittent Explosive Disorder - F63.81
2. Other Specified Personality Disorder - F60.89
3. Unspecified ADHD - F90.9
4. Unspecified Bipolar Disorder - F31.9
5. Other Specified Depressive Disorder - F32.8. 

This way, we also cover possible comorbid issues without excessive uncertainty.

**Considering personality disorders**

I'm looking at a few options here: Borderline personality disorder (F60.3), Antisocial personality disorder (F60.2), and Bipolar disorder, unspecified (F31.9). There's also a possibility for substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder, which might be F19.94, but I'm feeling a bit uncertain about that one. I want to choose the right one, so let’s explore further!

**Considering personality disorder diagnosis**

I’m analyzing the terms ""Other specified personality disorder"" and ""Unspecified personality disorder."" The former is used when the features cause distress but don’t meet specific criteria, while the latter is for situations where a clinician doesn’t specify the reason for distress. Both need to involve impairment. I also want to consider including ""Intermittent Explosive Disorder"" and other related diagnoses while finalizing my differential list, focusing on cluster B conditions and impulse-control disorders.

**Evaluating possible diagnoses**

I'm considering the most appropriate diagnoses to list based on the user's conditions. I'm hesitant to classify borderline and narcissistic traits as likely without support, so I'm thinking of suggesting other options like Intermittent Explosive Disorder and Unspecified Personality Disorder. I also have Bipolar Disorder and ADHD on the list. I need to ensure our top diagnoses align with the requirements, including the primary diagnosis and four secondary ones, while being mindful of potential substance use issues, despite the user denying any links.

**Finalizing the diagnosis list**

I'm considering which diagnoses to include for the user, particularly focusing on appropriate disorders like Cannabis Use Disorder in sustained remission. I also think about Stimulant Use Disorder, but I'm not certain it's applicable. For my final list, I'm aiming for Intermittent Explosive Disorder as the primary diagnosis, followed by ADHD, Borderline PD, and Bipolar Disorder. However, including both Borderline and Unspecified Personality feels redundant, so I’ll streamline the list to ensure clarity and relevance. It's essential to choose wisely!

**Selecting the diagnosis list**

I'm working on finalizing a list of possible diagnoses. I’ve considered including Intermittent Explosive Disorder, Other Specified Personality Disorder, ADHD, Bipolar Disorder, and Other Specified Anxiety Disorder. However, I'm noticing that including both a personality disorder and anxiety could be redundant. I’m thinking about switching to Unspecified Depressive Disorder instead of anxiety, but I'll retain Other Specified Anxiety Disorder since he does have brief anxiety episodes. I wonder which option is more accurate based on his symptoms!

**Refining the diagnosis list**

I'm debating whether to use ""Unspecified Anxiety Disorder"" or F41.9 since the individual has anxiety episodes, but I also wonder if it's appropriate. For depressive issues, Unspecified Depressive Disorder might fit, but he does have depressed mood episodes. I'll go with F41.9 for now. Now I need to finalize the top five diagnoses. I notice that ADHD as the second most likely feels off; perhaps ""Unspecified Personality Disorder"" could take its place. But then I question if his episodes are best described as Intermittent Explosive Disorder; they seem short-lived and impulsive.

**Creating a structured list**

I'm thinking through how to create a structured list of psychiatric diagnoses from the DSM-5-TR. I need to ensure it's well-organized and clear so that the user can easily reference it. I wonder about the best way to categorize these diagnoses—maybe by type or severity? I'll outline the major categories, then include specific disorders under each one. This approach should make it easy for the user to find what they're looking for!

**Evaluating diagnosis formatting**

I’m considering how to reduce the risk of mislabeling by using ""provisional"" for secondary diagnoses, or perhaps even the primary one. They might not prefer that, though. If I list “Unspecified bipolar and related disorder (provisional),” it could be acceptable. The instructions don’t explicitly say to avoid qualifiers, but I wonder if the user simply wants the diagnoses themselves. It seems prudent to stick to actual diagnoses rather than qualifiers, even though the case strongly supports IED as the primary diagnosis. For secondaries, I could mention differential diagnoses.

**Finalizing diagnosis options**

I’m considering keeping the format by including “(differential)” in the diagnosis label, but this might not align with official DSM guidelines. It might be better to simply list the diagnoses. I think IED should be the primary diagnosis, followed by plausible differentials like Borderline personality disorder, Narcissistic personality disorder, Bipolar disorder, and Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Antisocial personality disorder seems unlikely. There’s also the option of using ""Unspecified personality disorder"" or ""Other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder"" as differentials. IED should be the focus since many IED cases include aggressive outbursts.

**Determining plausible diagnoses**

I'm looking at the expected output, where IED should be the primary diagnosis. For secondary diagnoses, I’m considering Borderline personality disorder, Antisocial personality disorder, Bipolar disorder unspecified, and possibly Alcohol use disorder. However, since the individual denies any substance connection, including ""Alcohol use disorder, mild"" might not be suitable. I want to focus on providing the top five plausible diagnoses with their F-codes, and I think the best differentials to include would be Borderline personality disorder, Antisocial personality disorder, and some others based on relevance and plausibility.

**Clarifying diagnosis options**

I’m analyzing potential diagnoses, starting with Bipolar I disorder due to episodic irritability, although the durations don’t quite match. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder also pops up because of childhood impulsivity. I’m weighing whether Antisocial personality disorder is more plausible than Narcissistic personality disorder. However, I think Narcissistic may fit better since he shows demanding behaviors. It might be wise to list ""Unspecified personality disorder"" instead of several. I’d like to finalize my list with Intermittent Explosive Disorder, Borderline personality disorder, Unspecified bipolar disorder, and ADHD, or possibly switch to ""Other specified personality disorder"".

**Finalizing diagnosis considerations**

I’m reviewing potential diagnoses and thinking about including ""Unspecified bipolar and related disorder,"" ""Unspecified attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,"" and ""Other specified anxiety disorder."" I wonder if personality disorders are more relevant than anxiety, especially considering familial anger issues could suggest a genetic predisposition for Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED).

For the final list, I think I’ll include Intermittent Explosive Disorder, Borderline personality disorder, Unspecified ADHD, Unspecified bipolar disorder, and Unspecified anxiety disorder. However, I'm debating the relevance of Borderline versus ADHD, as well as the need for a personality disorder diagnosis, which may not apply here given the details of his situation.

**Evaluating potential diagnoses**

I'm considering different diagnoses, and I think the top five might be useful. First, what stands out are adjustment disorder with conduct disturbance, unspecified anxiety disorder, and other specified depressive disorder. Then, ADHD and bipolar could be potential candidates but maybe not as strong. Given the core symptoms of anger outbursts and impulsive aggression, I'm thinking Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) is a strong contender. IED, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder all fit within the core symptoms.","1. Intermittent explosive disorder - F63.81

156,"Matthew Tucker, a 45-year-old married European American plumber, was referred for a psychiatric evaluation after his family carried out an intervention to express their concern that his alcohol problems were getting out of control. Mr. Tucker denied having had a drink since making the appointment 3 days earlier.

For 20 years after high school, Mr. Tucker typically drank 3–5 beers per evening, five times per week. Over the last 7 years, he had consumed alcohol almost daily, with an average of 6 beers on weeknights and 12 beers on weekends and holidays. His wife repeatedly voiced her concern that he was “drinking too much,” but despite his efforts to limit his alcohol intake, Mr. Tucker continued to spend much of the weekend drinking, sometimes missing family get-togethers, and often passed out while watching TV in the evening. He remained productive at work, however, and never called in sick. In many ways, his history represented what is typically seen in alcohol use disorder. Mr. Tucker had achieved two 30-day periods of abstinence in the previous 4 years. Both times, he said he had quit drinking “cold turkey” in response to his wife’s concerns. He denied having had symptoms of alcohol withdrawal either time.

In the 6 months prior to the evaluation, Mr. Tucker had become uncharacteristically irritable, fatigued, dysphoric, and worried. He was unable to enjoy his usual activities, including food and sex, and had difficulty concentrating. He also reacted more emotionally to stresses and expressed unsubstantiated concern about the future of his business. The patient often awoke at 2:00 a.m. and had trouble getting back to sleep.

Mr. Tucker and his wife indicated that although this period of sadness had lasted 6 months, he had experienced several similar episodes in the prior 5 years, lasting 4–6 weeks each. They denied any such episodes earlier in his life.

Mr. Tucker had been married for 18 years, and he and his wife had one 17-year-old daughter. The patient was a high school graduate with 2 years of community college who currently owned a successful plumbing company. He denied any other history of psychiatric or medical problems, as well as any history of mania or suicide attempts. He had never seen a psychiatrist before.

At a recent annual checkup, Mr. Tucker’s internist noted a mildly elevated blood pressure (135/92), a γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) value of 47 IU/L, and a mean corpuscular volume of 92.5 μm3. All other laboratory results were in the normal range.

At the time of his first visit, Mr. Tucker was neatly dressed, maintained good eye contact, and showed no evidence of confusion or psychotic symptoms. His eyes teared up when he talked about the future, and he admitted to having felt sad for most of the day on a regular basis for the last 6 months, but he denied suicidal ideation or plans. His cognition was within normal limits, and he demonstrated an understanding of the effects that the alcohol was having on him.

A physical examination by the psychiatrist revealed a normal pulse rate, no tremor or sweating, and only a slightly elevated blood pressure.","1. Alcohol use disorder
2. Alcohol-induced depressive disorder",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Exploring possible diagnoses**

We need to identify the top five likely diagnoses. If symptoms are explained by depression, a separate anxiety disorder might not be necessary. In the DSM, we typically don't diagnose Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) if worry only happens during mood episodes. But GAD can coexist with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Worry appears linked to depression here. Another option could be ""Unspecified Depressive Disorder"" if we’re unsure about criteria or substance influence. Given his irritability and passing out, we might also consider ""Alcohol-Induced Sleep Disorder.""

**Analyzing depressive episodes and alcohol use**

The description highlights multiple episodes over the last five years with heavy drinking spanning seven years. This might suggest that depressive symptoms appeared after increased alcohol consumption, potentially making them alcohol-induced. However, the individual didn’t experience withdrawal symptoms after stopping cold turkey for 30 days, which is unusual after heavy drinking—perhaps indicating a moderate Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). The mood symptoms started recently, suggesting a link to alcohol or midlife changes, though major depression is still a possibility. Lab results show mild blood pressure and GGT levels, while his MCV is slightly above normal yet still considered normal.

**Identifying primary and secondary diagnoses**

The individual denies suicidal thoughts and mania, suggesting a likely primary diagnosis of moderate to severe Alcohol Use Disorder. A secondary diagnosis might be Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent. Other possibilities include ""Alcohol-Induced Depressive Disorder,"" ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder,"" ""Other Specified Anxiety Disorder,"" or ""Adjustment Disorder."" 

To finalize, I need to present a structured list of diagnoses and codes only, ensuring they align correctly. For instance, ""Alcohol Use Disorder, severe"" with the code F10.20, and for recurrent Major Depressive Disorder, the code is F33.1.

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

If we identify alcohol-induced mood disorder, it could clash with the primary alcohol dependence code. I need to determine whether the depressive symptoms are due to alcohol or are independent, then choose one diagnosis path. 

My final list of diagnoses should be:  
1. Alcohol Use Disorder, severe - F10.20  
2. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent episode, moderate - F33.1  
3. Generalized Anxiety Disorder - F41.1  
4. Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (alcohol-induced) - F10.24  
5. Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood - F43.21  

But I'm wondering if adjustment disorder fits well here.

**Determining potential diagnoses**

I think it's essential to consider both Alcohol-Induced Depressive Disorder and Alcohol-Induced Anxiety Disorder as possible differentials. We have to balance that with the coding implications; F10.24 for mood and F10.280 for anxiety. If we treat them as substance-induced, it complicates diagnosing Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). 

Ultimately, for the structured list, I’ll include:  
1. Alcohol Use Disorder, severe - F10.20  
2. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent episode, moderate - F33.1  
3. Generalized Anxiety Disorder - F41.1  
4. Alcohol-Induced Depressive Disorder - F10.24  
5. Alcohol-Induced Anxiety Disorder - F10.280  

This acknowledges both primary and substance-induced possibilities while fitting within the requested format.

**Compiling potential diagnoses**

I'm considering the primary and secondary diagnoses here, focusing on the most likely conditions. Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a strong candidate, but I also need to think about Alcohol-Induced Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). 

To narrow it down for the top five diagnoses, I’ll propose:  
1. Alcohol Use Disorder, severe - F10.20  
2. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent episode, moderate - F33.1  
3. Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder - F10.24  
4. Generalized Anxiety Disorder - F41.1  
5. Alcohol-Induced Anxiety Disorder - F10.280  

This covers the key conditions while aligning with the requested F-codes and maintains a focus on the interpretations of the symptoms.

**Listing potential diagnoses**

I’ve been analyzing the situation and thinking through the best potential diagnoses. For the top five, I’m considering the following:

1. Alcohol Use Disorder, severe - F10.20  
2. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent episode, moderate (with anxious distress) - F33.1  
3. Generalized Anxiety Disorder - F41.1  
4. Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (alcohol-induced) - F10.24  
5. Alcohol-induced anxiety disorder - F10.280  

I want to ensure I’m accurate in capturing the complexities of the case while keeping each diagnosis aligned with the DSM-5-TR F-codes.

**Finalizing diagnoses list**

I need to ensure I use precise DSM-5-TR terminology here. The primary diagnosis has to be ""Alcohol Use Disorder, severe"" - F10.20. The next could be ""Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent episode, moderate"" - F33.1. Following that, I might consider ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder"" - F41.1. Then, I'll include ""Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (alcohol-induced)"" - F10.24. Finally, let's add ""Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder (alcohol-induced)"" - F10.280. I just want my codes to be correct and relevant!

**Finalizing psychiatric diagnoses**

I need to create a structured list of diagnoses based on the vignette. My primary diagnosis will be ""Alcohol Use Disorder, severe"" (F10.20). Next, I'll add ""Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent episode, moderate"" (F33.1). Following that, ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder"" (F41.1) will come next. For the alcohol-related issues, I'll include ""Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder (alcohol-induced)"" (F10.24) and ""Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder (alcohol-induced)"" (F10.280).

157,"Nicholas Underwood, a 41-year-old married software engineer, entered an alcohol treatment program with this chief complaint: “I need to stop drinking or my wife will divorce me.”

At the time of admission, Mr. Underwood stated that he was drinking approximately 1 liter of vodka per day, every day, and had not had an alcohol-free day in over 2 years. For many years, Mr. Underwood had drunk alcohol only after work, but about a year prior to the evaluation he had begun to routinely drink in the morning whenever he had the day off. More recently, he had begun to feel “shaky” every morning and would sometimes treat that sensation with a drink, followed by more alcohol during the day.

Mr. Underwood experienced a number of problems related to drinking. His wife was “at the end of her rope” and considering divorce. His diminished ability to concentrate at work was “sinking” his once-promising career. He was spending more time trying to recover from the effects of drinking and found himself planning strategies both for abstinence and for surreptitiously taking his next drink.

Mr. Underwood first tried alcohol in high school and said that he had always been able to hold his liquor more than his friends could. In college, he was one of the heaviest drinkers in a fraternity known as “Animal House” around campus. Through his 30s, he gradually increased the frequency of his drinking from primarily on weekends to daily. Over the prior year, he had switched from being exclusively a beer drinker to drinking vodka. He had gone to many Alcoholics Anonymous meetings over the years but tended to drink as soon as the meeting ended. He had received no formal treatment.

The patient denied recent use of other substances; he had smoked marijuana and snorted cocaine several times during college but never since. He had used no other illicit drugs and took no medications. He did not smoke cigarettes. He had experienced blackouts on several occasions during college but not since then. He had no history of seizures and no other medical problems. Family history was significant for alcohol use disorder in his father and paternal grandfather.

Mr. Underwood entered the alcohol treatment program at approximately 3:00 p.m., having not had a drink since the evening before. He was diaphoretic and exhibited significant tremulousness in his hands. He complained of anxiety, restlessness, irritability, nausea, and recent insomnia.

Clinical evaluation revealed a casually groomed, diaphoretic man who was cooperative but anxiously pacing and who immediately said, “I’m getting ready to jump out of my skin.” Speech was of normal rate, rhythm, and tone. He denied depression. There was no evidence of psychotic thinking, and he denied auditory, visual, or tactile hallucinations. He was alert and oriented to person, place, and date. He had no gross memory deficits, but his attention and concentration were noted to be reduced.

Notable features of his physical examination were marked diaphoresis, a blood pressure of 155/95, a heart rate of 104 beats/minute, severe tremulousness in his upper extremities, and hyperactive deep tendon reflexes throughout. Laboratory test findings were within normal limits except for aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, which were approximately 3 times normal.","1. Alcohol withdrawal
2. Alcohol use disorder, severe",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Clarifying ICD-10 Codes**

The user wants to provide accurate ICD-10 F-codes related to alcohol use disorder. F10.20 works for alcohol dependence, uncomplicated. However, considering withdrawal, F10.20 may serve as primary while F10.239 handles withdrawal. I note that it’s possible to list “alcohol use disorder, severe,” alongside “alcohol withdrawal.” I’m thinking they also might want to include “alcohol-induced anxiety disorder” due to symptoms from withdrawal. It’s vital to sort through these codes carefully!

**Refining Diagnoses and Coding**

I’m looking into possible diagnoses like ""Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder"" since the anxiety must persist beyond withdrawal. However, in this case, the anxiety seems linked to withdrawal, so I’ll focus just on coding ""Alcohol withdrawal."" There's a chance of ""Alcohol-induced sleep disorder"" due to insomnia, but I’ll have to be careful. Potential top diagnoses might be: 1) Alcohol use disorder, severe, 2) Alcohol withdrawal (uncomplicated), and 3) Alcohol-induced sleep disorder. I need to ensure I have five total, so I’ll finalize them carefully!

**Building Plausible Diagnoses**

I’m considering plausible but less likely conditions to include based on evidence. We can look at ""Other unspecified alcohol-induced disorder,"" but it might be unnecessary. ""Alcohol intoxication"" wouldn’t apply since the last drink was the previous evening. ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" could be a possibility, but I need to ensure the diagnosis list remains plausible with four secondary diagnoses.

I’m contemplating ""Alcohol-induced anxiety disorder"" linked to withdrawal. Using the DSM-5 specifier of ""Alcohol use disorder, severe, in a controlled environment"" might fit too. So, I must identify three more diagnoses!

**Identifying Plausible Diagnoses**

I’m reviewing potential diagnoses and recognizing that I need to stick to the information available. There’s no mention of problematic use for cannabis, and while I could say ""No diagnosis,"" I still need five. I’m considering ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety"" due to marital stress, but anxiety is mainly from withdrawal. 

I’m unsure if ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" or ""Insomnia disorder"" fits, as recent symptoms are tricky. I’m pondering disorders like ""Alcohol-induced mood disorder"" but feeling doubtful. The challenge is finding five valid claims within these constraints!

**Determining Top Diagnoses and Codes**

The user requests the top five diagnoses with corresponding ICD-10 F-codes, so I need to provide a structured list. I'm considering options even if they're ""Other specified"" or ""Unspecified."" I might include ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" (F41.9), as anxiety is reported, but anxiety symptoms often link to withdrawal.

The strongest candidates at this point are: 1) Alcohol use disorder, severe (F10.20), 2) Alcohol withdrawal, uncomplicated (F10.230), 3) Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder (F10.280), and 4) Alcohol-induced sleep disorder (F10.282). For the fifth, I’ll consider anything plausible while being careful not to fabricate!

**Exploring Diagnoses and Codes**

I need to identify plausible diagnoses based on the user's information, aiming for five items. I considered including ""Alcohol-induced mild neurocognitive disorder,"" but it probably doesn't fit. I also thought about ICD-10 codes like F10.988, yet I need to be careful not to fabricate evidence.

For stronger options, I could go with: 1) Alcohol use disorder, severe (F10.20), 2) Alcohol withdrawal, uncomplicated (F10.230), 3) Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder (F10.280), and 4) Substance/medication-induced sleep disorder (F10.282). For the fifth, I’m debating among other anxiety-related conditions, but I want to ensure I’m being accurate and reclaim the necessary details!

**Clarifying Primary and Differential Diagnoses**

I’m considering the most appropriate primary diagnosis for the user’s case. It seems Alcohol Use Disorder, severe (F10.20), fits best as the underlying condition, while Alcohol Withdrawal (F10.230) could be secondary due to acute withdrawal signs. 

For additional differentials, I might consider Alcohol-induced anxiety disorder (F10.280) and Alcohol-induced sleep disorder (F10.282), but I need to be cautious not to fabricate details. I’m also thinking about including unspecified anxiety, but it’s often linked to withdrawal symptoms. So, I’ll focus on accurate diagnoses supported by the information provided!

**Identifying Key Diagnoses**

I’m looking to identify the top psychiatric diagnoses for the user’s condition, starting with ""Alcohol Use Disorder, severe"" (F10.20) as the primary diagnosis. ""Alcohol Withdrawal, uncomplicated"" would be next (F10.230). 

For the remaining diagnoses, ""Alcohol-induced anxiety disorder"" (F10.280) and ""Alcohol-induced sleep disorder"" (F10.282) are strong candidates based on his symptoms. I'm uncertain about including mild neurocognitive disorder, but it's worth considering. Ultimately, I'll compile F-codes based on the most accurate diagnoses that reflect his situation!

**Selecting Alcohol-Related Diagnoses**

I’m working on selecting the top psychiatric diagnoses related to alcohol use for the user’s situation. I’m considering several options but I think the best choices are ""Alcohol use disorder, severe"" (F10.20) and ""Alcohol withdrawal, uncomplicated"" (F10.230). For the next two, I can use ""Alcohol-induced anxiety disorder"" (F10.280) and ""Alcohol-induced sleep disorder"" (F10.282). Finally, I might include ""Unspecified alcohol-induced disorder"" (F10.99) to complete the list, even if it's a bit vague. This should cover the essential diagnoses accurately!

**Choosing Alcohol-Related Diagnoses**

I’m sorting through the options for the top psychiatric diagnoses related to alcohol use. I think the best picks are: 1) ""Alcohol use disorder, severe"" - F10.20, 2) ""Alcohol withdrawal, uncomplicated"" - F10.230, 3) ""Alcohol-induced anxiety disorder"" - F10.280, and 4) ""Alcohol-induced sleep disorder"" - F10.282. For the fifth, I’m considering ""Other specified alcohol-induced disorder"" - F10.288 to account for any cognitive impacts, even if it's somewhat vague. These selections should provide a comprehensive representation for the user's situation!

**Finalizing Alcohol-Related Diagnoses**

I’m looking to finalize a structured list of DSM-5-TR alcohol-related psychiatric diagnoses. The primary five I’m considering are: 1) ""Alcohol Use Disorder, severe"" - F10.20, 2) ""Alcohol Withdrawal, uncomplicated"" - F10.230, 3) ""Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder (Alcohol-Induced)"" - F10.280, 4) ""Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder (Alcohol-Induced, insomnia type)"" - F10.282, and 5) ""Other specified alcohol-induced disorder"" - F10.288. I’m ensuring proper naming and formatting as I prepare this list!

**Drafting Alcohol-Related Diagnoses**

I’m considering the best set of DSM-5-TR alcohol-related psychiatric diagnoses. I think it’s crucial to include: 1) ""Alcohol Use Disorder, severe"" - F10.20, 2) ""Alcohol Withdrawal, uncomplicated"" - F10.230, 3) ""Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder (Alcohol-Induced)"" - F10.280, 4) ""Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder (Alcohol-Induced)"" - F10.282, and 5) either ""Unspecified Anxiety Disorder"" - F41.9 or ""Other Specified Alcohol-Induced Disorder"" - F10.288. I need to stick to the F-codes to maintain accuracy!

**Determining Alcohol-Related Diagnoses**

I need to compile a list of top 5 diagnoses for this case, focused on alcohol-related issues. For certain, I’m including: 1) ""Alcohol Use Disorder, severe"" - F10.20, and 2) ""Alcohol Withdrawal, uncomplicated"" - F10.230. I can also consider adding 3) ""Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder (Alcohol-Induced)"" - F10.280 and 4) ""Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder"" - F10.282. For the fifth, ""Unspecified Anxiety Disorder"" - F41.9 could work, or I might include ""Alcohol-Induced Disorder, Unspecified"" - F10.29 instead.

**Sorting Alcohol-Induced Diagnoses**

I’m considering various diagnostic codes related to alcohol-induced disorders. There's ""Alcohol-Induced Disorder, Other"" - F10.288, and ""Unspecified Alcohol-Induced Disorder"" - F10.29. I might also include ""Alcohol-Induced Anxiety Disorder"" - F10.280 and ""Alcohol-Induced Sleep Disorder"" - F10.282. Despite the lack of mood symptoms, I’m debating on ""Alcohol-Induced Depressive Disorder"" as a possible inclusion, alongside ensuring that I provide the required DSM-5 diagnostic names. It's tricky to navigate the specifics while adhering to these constraints!

**Clarifying Alcohol Disorder Diagnoses**

I’m analyzing various alcohol-induced disorder codes and DSM classifications. I can list “Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder” and “Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder,” both linked to alcohol withdrawal. For the fifth diagnosis, I'm debating between ""Unspecified Alcohol-Induced Disorder"" and ""Other Alcohol-Induced Disorder,"" which seem to fit but not strictly align with DSM. Given the user's emphasis on DSM-5-TR names, I might lean towards “Alcohol-Induced Disorder, Unspecified.” I need to ensure these intentions capture the symptoms accurately!

**Identifying Alcohol-Related Diagnoses**

I’m exploring the DSM-5 classifications around alcohol-induced disorders. I’ve come across “Unspecified Alcohol-Related Disorder” and “Other Specified Alcohol-Related Disorder,” which can be used when symptoms cause distress but don't meet other criteria. I need to compile distinct DSM-5 diagnoses for alcohol-related issues. I’m considering various possibilities such as “Alcohol Use Disorder, Severe,” “Alcohol Withdrawal,” “Substance-Induced Anxiety Disorder,” and might include “Unspecified Alcohol-Induced Disorder” or “Alcohol-Induced Depressive Disorder,” though it’s tricky. I aim for a clear list without overlaps.

**Determining Alcohol-Related Diagnoses**

I’m working through categories related to alcohol-induced disorders like “Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder” with different onset specifiers. I’m recalling the DSM-5-TR structure, especially the distinctions between “Other Specified” and “Unspecified Alcohol-Related Disorders.” It seems that I can list diagnoses like “Alcohol Use Disorder, severe”; “Alcohol Withdrawal”; “Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder”; and “Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder.” For the fifth diagnosis, I'm contemplating options like “Alcohol-induced Depressive Disorder,” but I need to stay accurate based on the available information. Overall, I want to ensure a clear and precise listing.

**Assessing Alcohol Withdrawal and Diagnoses**

I’m considering the case of a 41-year-old experiencing tremors, anxiety, and insomnia after stopping heavy alcohol use. The most likely diagnosis is alcohol withdrawal, but other possibilities could include sedative-hypnotic withdrawal or generalized anxiety disorder. I need to list the top five diagnoses based on the DSM-5-TR, focusing on primary and secondary conditions. Alcohol Use Disorder and Alcohol Withdrawal seem to be the primary choices, followed by Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder, Sleep Disorder, and possibly Generalized Anxiety Disorder as a differential. It's essential to prioritize these accurately.

**Considering Substance-Induced Disorders**

I’m analyzing the case for potential diagnoses, focusing on substance-induced conditions. The main concern is alcohol withdrawal, which meets criteria. I’m also considering options like substance-induced anxiety and sleep disorders. It’s tricky because the user insists on a top five list. Alcohol Use Disorder and Alcohol Withdrawal seem to be key diagnoses. For the remaining spots, I could potentially include Unspecified Anxiety Disorder or even Substance/Medication-Induced disorders. I need to balance the likelihood of these while ensuring they fit the case scenario.

**Deciding on Alcohol-Related Diagnoses**

I'm trying to gather the right psychiatric diagnoses based on the vignette without fabricating details. It's clear that Alcohol Use Disorder and Alcohol Withdrawal are prominent. I wonder if I can also include diagnoses like Alcohol-Induced Anxiety Disorder and Alcohol-Induced Sleep Disorder since anxiety and insomnia are present. However, I need a fifth diagnosis and should be cautious about which ones I can reasonably support based on the information provided. I think Unspecified Anxiety Disorder might come up as a possible option, but it needs further consideration.

**Assessing Neurocognitive Symptoms**

I’m pondering whether his impaired concentration and planning strategies for abstinence could indicate an obsessive-compulsive disorder, but that doesn’t fit. I think “Major Depressive Disorder” might be a contender, though he denies it. I’m also considering “Alcohol-Induced Depressive Disorder” due to symptoms. As for neurocognitive issues, I'm unsure if he meets criteria for mild neurocognitive disorder since his deficits might be tied to withdrawal. Listing “Alcohol-Induced Disorder, Unspecified” seems like a reasonable option to capture cognitive issues here.

**Finalizing Diagnoses and Codes**

I’m contemplating various diagnoses for this case, including “Alcohol-induced anxiety disorder” and “Alcohol-induced sleep disorder.” However, I’m thinking those might not take priority. Overall, the five diagnoses I’m settling on are: 

1. Alcohol Use Disorder, severe - F10.20 
2. Alcohol Withdrawal, uncomplicated - F10.230 
3. Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder (alcohol-induced) - F10.280 
4. Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder (alcohol-induced) - F10.282 
5. Alcohol-Induced Disorder, unspecified - F10.29 

I’m confirming that the codes are consistent and reflect the user’s needs.

**Deciding on Alcohol-Related Disorders**

I’m thinking about coding choices for diagnoses. Leaning towards alcohol withdrawal and Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) seems best. Now I’m considering three more diagnoses. I'm weighing options like “Unspecified anxiety disorder” and “Insomnia disorder,” but redundancy is a concern. 

The top five likely diagnoses include:  
1. Alcohol Use Disorder, severe - F10.20  
2. Alcohol Withdrawal, uncomplicated - F10.230  
3. Alcohol-induced anxiety disorder - F10.280  
4. Alcohol-induced sleep disorder - F10.282  
5. Alcohol-induced disorder, unspecified - F10.29  

I hope these align well with the provided context!

**Assessing Alcohol-Induced Diagnoses**

I'm considering alcohol-induced disorders and whether to group them. The code F10.288 could refer to ""other alcohol-induced disorders,"" but may not fully cover cognitive issues. Maybe I can justify mild neurocognitive disorder due to attention deficits. I'm thinking of options like “Alcohol-induced anxiety disorder” and “Alcohol-induced sleep disorder.” 

A potential list of five diagnoses could be:  
1. Alcohol Use Disorder, severe - F10.20  
2. Alcohol Withdrawal, uncomplicated - F10.230  
3. Alcohol-induced anxiety disorder - F10.280  
4. Alcohol-induced sleep disorder - F10.282  
5. Alcohol-induced disorder, unspecified - F10.29  

This seems to align with the provided context!

**Finalizing Alcohol-Related Diagnoses**

I’m organizing a list of five alcohol-related diagnoses for clarity. It seems reasonable to include “Alcohol Use Disorder, severe” and “Alcohol Withdrawal, uncomplicated.” Next, I think “Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder” and “Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder” make sense as well. For the fifth, “Alcohol-Induced Mild Neurocognitive Disorder” could fit, but I want to make sure it aligns with the DSM definitions. 

Here’s the structured list:  
1. Alcohol Use Disorder, severe - F10.20  
2. Alcohol Withdrawal, uncomplicated - F10.230  
3. Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder - F10.280  
4. Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder - F10.282  
5. Alcohol-Induced Mild Neurocognitive Disorder - F10.288

**Preparing Alcohol-Related Diagnosis List**

I’m focusing on creating a concise list of alcohol-related diagnoses following the exact formatting required. It seems “Alcohol Use Disorder, severe” is correct with code F10.20. For withdrawal, simply labeling it “Alcohol Withdrawal, uncomplicated” fits well with F10.230. Next, I’ll use “Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder (alcohol-induced, with onset during withdrawal)” for F10.280, and “Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder (alcohol-induced)” for F10.282. Finally, I’ll include “Substance/Medication-Induced Mild Neurocognitive Disorder (alcohol-related)” with F10.288.

1. Alcohol Use Disorder, severe - F10.20  
2. Alcohol Withdrawal, uncomplicated - F10.230  
3. Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder (alcohol-induced, with onset during withdrawal) - F10.280

158,"Oliver Vincent had never seen himself as being an addict. He had always been “on top of things.” At age 35, he was independently wealthy as the owner of several clothing franchises, lived with an ex-partner in a more-than-comfortable apartment in New York City, worked out every day, enjoyed the company of a group of loving friends, and, although single, had not given up on the idea of someday (preferably soon) finding the perfect man to share his life with. Mr. Vincent came out to his Irish Catholic family when he was 19. His parents had already guessed that Mr. Vincent was gay long before he told them, and they took the non-news fairly well. Their main concern had been that their son might be discriminated against because of his sexuality, get hurt, and live a lonely life. Nothing could be farther from the way things turned out: Mr. Vincent was “out and proud” and living it up.

When Mr. Vincent found himself with a substance use problem, he addressed it the same way he had dealt with pretty much everything else: head on. For the first time in his life, he decided to see a psychiatrist.

Mr. Vincent described a pattern that revolved around weekend “party and play” activities. On Friday and Saturday evenings—and occasionally during the week—he would go out to dinner with friends and then to a club or a private party. He tended to drink two or three cocktails and four to five glasses of wine during the evening. Without the alcohol, he found he could easily say “no” to substances, but “after a good buzz, if someone has coke—and there is always someone around who has coke—I use. And then my heart starts to race, and then I do everything I can to hook up. I used to go online, but these days, it’s all on Scruff and good ol’ Grindr.”

Party and play are classic code words for drugs and sex, respectively. The term is sometimes abbreviated PNP.

Scruff and Grindr are smartphone applications that use GPS to identify and connect similarly inclined individuals in a person’s geographical vicinity.

Overall, Mr. Vincent drank alcohol and used cocaine three to four times a week and “occasionally used Tina and bath salts.” He could hardly attend Monday morning meetings, much less prepare for them, and had been trying to cut down on his cocaine use for the prior 6 months without success.

Tina is slang for crystal methamphetamine (i.e., from crystal to Christina to Tina). Bath salts is slang for a powder that contains a variety of synthetic stimulants (e.g., cathinone derivatives).

Since Mr. Vincent had started using cocaine regularly, he had lost weight and had trouble sleeping. He worried that his effort at the gym was going to waste. His business continued to succeed, but his own effectiveness had decreased. Most importantly, he did not practice safer sex when high on stimulants, and because he did not want to be on a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) regimen, he worried about HIV seroconversion.","Cocaine use disorder, moderate",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Evaluating substance use criteria**

If we want to classify a clinically relevant substance use, we could code something like ""Other (or unknown) substance use, unspecified"" or ""Stimulant use, unspecified."" However, given the prompt's focus on use disorders, I might consider ""Other stimulant use disorder,"" perhaps as mild. But, the user only engages occasionally and lacks evidence of significant impairment or unsuccessful attempts. However, risky behaviors like unsafe sex while using stimulants could be noteworthy. Yet, overall, the criteria seem insufficient for a formal diagnosis.

**Considering stimulant use impact**

We might view the ""party and play"" pattern as causing occupational impairment, like missing Monday meetings, and physical symptoms, such as insomnia and weight loss, which could arise from stimulant use—specifically mentioning meth and bath salts, but also linked to regular cocaine use. He uses cocaine 3-4 times a week while using other stimulants occasionally. Although there may not be enough evidence for a strong diagnosis, we could consider ""Other Stimulant Use Disorder, mild"" as a plausible secondary option since it's in line with the request for likely diagnoses.

**Exploring diagnostic options**

Since they asked for DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses, it’s important to consider criteria thoroughly. In uncertain cases, I could use unspecified or other specified diagnoses to reflect partial symptoms. I could suggest “Other stimulant use disorder, unspecified” (F15.99). The DSM includes ""Other (or unknown) substance-related disorder"" and ""Unspecified stimulant-related disorder,"" used when symptoms cause distress but don’t quite meet full criteria. While there’s some information, it isn't complete enough for a formal diagnosis. Instead, I may label it as ""Stimulant use, unspecified.""

**Evaluating substance-related disorders**

I think we could consider using ""Other (or unknown) stimulant-related disorder."" The DSM provides categories like ""Other specified [Substance]-related disorder"" and ""Unspecified [Substance]-related disorder."" For stimulants, we have specific terms for when symptoms are clinically significant but don’t meet full criteria. In this case with meth and bath salts, we might not have enough evidence for a full diagnosis, but we know there’s some concern. Since cocaine is the main issue, perhaps we can still note ""Other specified stimulant-related disorder"" among the top diagnoses.

**Determining diagnostic codes**

The question is looking for the top 5 likely DSM diagnoses, and I believe they may want Cocaine Use Disorder, Alcohol Use Disorder, Stimulant Use Disorders for meth and synthetic options, and possibly insomnia. For accuracy, I think Cocaine Use Disorder should be treated as moderate due to observable impairment. I’ll suggest: 

1. Cocaine Use Disorder, moderate - F14.20  
2. Cocaine-induced sleep disorder, insomnia type - F14.982  
3. Alcohol Use Disorder, mild - F10.10  
4. Other Stimulant Use Disorder, mild - F15.10  
5. Cocaine intoxication - F14.929  

This should cover the primary concerns while staying aligned with DSM and ICD-10.

**Finalizing diagnostic codes**

Here's the final list of the top 5 likely diagnoses, formatted as specified:

1. Cocaine Use Disorder, moderate - F14.20  
2. Cocaine-Induced Sleep Disorder, insomnia type - F14.982  
3. Alcohol Use Disorder, mild - F10.10  
4. Other Stimulant (amphetamine-type, incl. methamphetamine/synthetic cathinones) Use Disorder, mild - F15.10  
5. Cocaine Intoxication - F14.929  

This aligns well with DSM-5-TR names and corresponding ICD-10 codes, capturing the primary and secondary diagnoses accurately.","1. Cocaine Use Disorder, moderate - F14.20

159,"Peter Winters, a 46-year-old married white minister, was referred to the psychiatry outpatient department by his primary care doctor for depressive symptoms and opioid misuse in the setting of chronic right knee pain.

Mr. Winters injured his right knee playing basketball 17 months earlier. His mother gave him several tablets of hydrocodone-acetaminophen that she had for back pain, and he found this helpful. When he ran out of the pills and his pain persisted, he went to the emergency room. He was told he had a mild sprain. He was given a 1-month supply of hydrocodone-acetaminophen. He took the pills as prescribed for 1 month, and his pain resolved.

After stopping the pills, however, Mr. Winters began to experience a recurrence of the pain in his knee. He saw an orthopedist, who ordered imaging studies and determined that there was no structural damage. Mr. Winters was given another 1-month supply of hydrocodone-acetaminophen. This time, however, he needed to take more than prescribed in order to ease the pain. He also felt dysphoric and “achy” when he abstained from taking the medication, and described a “craving” for more opioids. He returned to the orthopedist, who referred him to a pain specialist.

Mr. Winters was too embarrassed to go to the pain specialist, believing that his faith and strength should help him overcome the pain. He found it impossible to live without the pain medication, however, because of the pain, dysphoria, and muscle aches when he stopped the medication. He also began to “enjoy the high” and experienced intense craving. He began to frequent emergency rooms to receive more opioids, often lying about the timing and nature of his right knee pain, and even stole pills from his mother on two occasions. He became preoccupied with trying to find more opioids, and his work and home life suffered. He endorsed low mood, especially when contemplating the impact of opioids on his life, but denied any other mood or neurovegetative symptoms. Eventually, he told his primary care doctor about his opioid use and low mood, and that doctor referred him to the outpatient psychiatry clinic.

Mr. Winters had a history of two lifetime major depressive episodes that were treated successfully with escitalopram by his primary care doctor. He also had a history of an alcohol use disorder when he was in his 20s. He managed to quit using alcohol on his own after a family intervention. He smoked two packs of cigarettes daily. His father suffered from depression, and “almost everyone” on his mother’s side of the family had “issues with addiction.” He had been married to his wife for 20 years, and they had two school-age children. He had been a minister in his church for 15 years. Results of a recent physical examination and laboratory testing performed by his primary care physician had been within normal limits.

On mental status examination, Mr. Winters was cooperative and did not exhibit any psychomotor abnormalities. He answered most questions briefly, often simply saying “yes” or “no.” Speech was of a normal rate and tone, without tangentiality or circumstantiality. He reported that his mood was “lousy,” and his affect was dysphoric and constricted. He denied symptoms of paranoia or hallucinations. He denied any thoughts of harming himself or others. Memory, both recent and remote, was grossly intact.","1. Opioid use disorder
2. Tobacco use disorder
3. Alcohol use disorder, in remission
4. Major depressive disorder",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Considering diagnoses**

I’m thinking about various diagnoses that might fit someone with low mood, particularly related to opioid use and mood changes. I need to narrow down to the top five possibilities. 

Firstly, there’s opioid use disorder, then adjustment disorder with depressed mood, followed by tobacco use disorder, and alcohol use disorder in sustained remission. Lastly, I’m weighing major depressive disorder; he has a history of episodes but isn't currently meeting all criteria. I should include it as a secondary diagnosis.

**Evaluating possible diagnoses**

I need to provide the top five DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses based on current and relevant past disorders. While historical conditions like alcohol use disorder in remission and a history of major depressive disorder are relevant, I need one more to complete my list.

I initially thought of opioid-induced anxiety or withdrawal, but those don’t seem to fit. Opioid-induced sexual dysfunction is also unlikely. I’m considering ""somatic symptom disorder"" due to pain, but that feels uncertain. Maybe “other unspecified opioid-related disorder” could make sense here?

**Assessing withdrawal symptoms**

I’m contemplating whether to include opioid withdrawal or intoxication in my diagnosis, but it's tricky. Chronic pain is more of a non-psychiatric diagnosis, though ""Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions"" could apply here. 

The individual has chronic knee pain and uses opioids, but the pain doesn't seem related enough to warrant a diagnosis. 

I’m also considering ""Opioid-induced depressive disorder,"" especially since he experiences dysphoria during withdrawal. However, his low mood seems to persist even when not obviously in withdrawal, making it a bit complex to pin down.

**Evaluating withdrawal episodes**

Given that he exhibits withdrawal symptoms when trying to stop opioids, that suggests he experiences withdrawal episodes. However, he might not be currently in withdrawal if he's still using. The DSM can diagnose ""Opioid withdrawal"" if he has reduced heavy use and shows withdrawal symptoms, which he does.

Still, I’m considering listing ""Opioid withdrawal"" as a secondary diagnosis, though it may overlap with opioid use disorder. For my top five diagnoses, clearly, the first is severe opioid use disorder, followed by tobacco use disorder.

**Determining depressive disorders**

I'm working through several potential diagnoses, starting with alcohol use disorder in sustained remission and moving to depressive disorders. He has low mood with some prior episodes but doesn't fully meet criteria for major depressive disorder. 

""Adjustment disorder"" seems plausible, but the stressor's timeline may not align. I’m leaning towards classifying him as having ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" due to persistent distress. 

There’s also the chance of ""Opioid-induced depressive disorder,"" since his mood may be linked to opioid use and withdrawal. However, the mood might stem more from guilt. I need to ensure the diagnosis reflects his symptoms accurately while meeting the DSM criteria.

**Finalizing diagnostic considerations**

He seems more preoccupied with obtaining opioids than with the pain itself, which raises several potential diagnoses. Top of the list is ""Opioid use disorder severe,"" followed by tobacco and alcohol use disorders. For depressive conditions, ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" or ""Adjustment disorder with depressed mood"" both seem suitable since he has low mood linked to opioid consequences.

While he has a history of major depressive disorder, current symptoms don't fit neatly into this diagnosis. However, ""Opioid withdrawal"" might not apply if he’s still using. The diagnosis needs to accurately reflect his situation while sticking to the available information.

**Assessing opioid and depressive disorders**

This case involves a 46-year-old minister with a history of opioid use disorder and depressive symptoms. His low mood seems linked more to substance use and guilt than a major depressive episode. The symptoms currently suggest ""Opioid-induced depressive disorder,"" but we need to confirm that the low mood developed during withdrawal or intoxication.

For tobacco use disorder, daily smoking of two packs indicates heavy use, but we lack details to fully diagnose it as a disorder.

With alcohol use, he has a history of dependence but is in sustained remission. The coding depends on the severity of past alcohol issues.

**Analyzing substance use and mood disorders**

For alcohol use disorder in sustained remission, if his previous severity was moderate or severe, I’d use F10.21. The same goes for opioid use disorder, where F11.20 indicates severe. His opioid use indicates a potential ""substance-induced depressive disorder,"" but we need to ensure it developed during withdrawal.

His current issues include opioid misuse and depressive symptoms, with possible diagnoses including Opioid Use Disorder, an unspecified depressive disorder, and alcohol use disorder in remission. We must aim for a structured DSM-5 diagnosis list that accurately reflects his situation.

**Evaluating depressive and substance use disorders**

The symptoms he's describing, like being ""dysphoric"" and ""achy,"" indicate potential issues, but we need three symptoms for an opioid withdrawal diagnosis, and he doesn't meet that criteria. For substance-induced depressive disorder, we need evidence that symptoms developed due to intoxication or withdrawal, but we might lean towards unspecified depressive disorder (F32.A) given the information we have.

I’ll code the other diagnoses: Opioid Use Disorder (F11.20), Tobacco Use Disorder (F17.210), and Alcohol Use Disorder in remission (F10.21). For the depressive side, we can include unspecified depressive disorder but maybe also acknowledge his history of major depressive disorder — just being cautious to avoid redundancy.

**Determining diagnoses**

I need to identify the top five likely diagnoses, but they might not have to be mutually exclusive. It's tricky because a current unspecified depressive disorder and a history of recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD) in remission could coexist. However, since he shows depressed mood, that's a challenge for diagnosing full remission. 

I can list opioid use disorder, unspecified depressive disorder, tobacco use disorder, and alcohol use disorder in remission. For the fifth, ""Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions"" (F54) seems fitting because his beliefs influence his opioid misuse and pain management, even if closely linked to substance use disorder.

**Examining diagnoses**

I’m considering that for psychological factors impacting conditions, I might code F54, but opioid use disorder clearly affects knee pain management. I can contemplate other diagnoses, but I think “Opioid-induced depressive disorder” makes sense. 

For my top five diagnoses list, I could go with:
1. Severe opioid use disorder (F11.20)
2. Opioid-induced depressive disorder 
3. Tobacco use disorder (F17.210)
4. Alcohol use disorder in remission
5. Major depressive disorder, recurrent (by history), or unspecified. 

I want to ensure accurate ICD-10 codes while reflecting the patient's history and current symptoms.

**Clarifying diagnosis codes**

I'm consulting DSM-5 codes for Tobacco Use Disorder and considering using F17.210 for nicotine dependence from smoking cigarettes. Even though DSM-5 typically uses F17.200 as unspecified, I think F17.210 fits better here.

For the top five diagnoses, I’m thinking of:

1. Opioid use disorder, severe - F11.20
2. Opioid-induced depressive disorder - F11.24
3. Tobacco use disorder - F17.210
4. Alcohol use disorder, in sustained remission - F10.21
5. Major depressive disorder, recurrent (history) - F33.40 

I want to ensure accuracy while reflecting current and historical contexts.

**Defining psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm considering how to classify the patient's conditions properly based on DSM-5-TR guidelines. I shouldn't include a history of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in my primary diagnoses, but I can include ""MDD, recurrent"" as part of his history.

Given the prompt to provide a structured list of top five diagnoses with corresponding ICD-10 F-codes, I think the list should include:

1. Opioid Use Disorder - F11.20
2. MDD recurrent, in remission - F33.40
3. Tobacco Use Disorder - F17.210
4. Alcohol Use Disorder, in sustained remission - F10.21
5. Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood - F43.21 

This list considers both current and historical symptoms accurately.

**Evaluating depressive disorders**

I'm analyzing how to classify the patient's mood issues. We could list ""Opioid-induced depressive disorder"" to reflect current symptoms, and consider ""Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in full remission"" based on history. However, for full remission, he'd typically need to show no symptoms.

Since his mood seems tied to psychosocial factors rather than the opioids themselves, I think it might be better to classify it as ""Opioid-induced depressive disorder.""

As for ICD-10 codes, I'd consider using F11.24 for opioid-induced mood disorders. But when structuring the top five diagnoses, I’ll carefully avoid double coding while including current symptoms.

**Assessing depressive diagnoses**

I'm contemplating whether to classify the patient with ""Major depressive disorder, recurrent, in partial remission,"" but I need to ensure there's sufficient symptom presence. Alternatively, ""Opioid-induced depressive disorder"" might better capture the situation, focusing on the impact of opioids on mood. 

But can I justify this diagnosis? His low mood seems connected to the opioids and his life situation. I also need to list five diagnoses carefully to avoid ambiguity. I’ll possibly list items like opioid use disorder and unspecified depressive disorder as key factors, ensuring I cover his history without overcomplicating things.

**Clarifying depressive diagnoses**

I’m considering five possible diagnoses: opioid use disorder, adjustment disorder, tobacco use disorder, alcohol use disorder in sustained remission, and possibly major depressive disorder in remission. I think adjustment disorder with depressed mood could work better than unspecified depressive disorder because it relates to identified stressors like opioid misuse. 

The timeline for onset is tricky, but his low mood seems connected to the opioid impacts on his life. I feel it's safer to classify it that way rather than risk misdiagnosing without clear criteria.

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

I’m focusing on the possible diagnoses I need to finalize. First, I want to ensure I include ""Opioid Use Disorder, severe."" Then I think about ""Depressive disorder (unspecified)"" to capture his current symptoms. Next, I should add ""Tobacco Use Disorder"" and ""Alcohol Use Disorder in sustained remission."" Finally, I need a fifth diagnosis. I might choose ""Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in remission"" or explore other options like ""Opioid-induced depressive disorder,"" but I want to keep it consistent and meaningful. Let's finalize those five clear diagnoses.

**Deciding on diagnoses**

I'm working through which diagnoses to include. I think ""Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in full remission"" could be a choice, but he has depressed mood currently, which complicates things. Maybe ""Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in partial remission"" would better fit his history and current symptoms. 

Another option is ""Opioid-induced depressive disorder,"" acknowledging that his low mood might stem directly from opioid use. Ultimately, I want to ensure I have five clear diagnoses that balance all aspects, and I’ll finalize that list now!

**Diagnosing the case**

I'm trying to sort out the right diagnoses based on the information given. ""Opioid use disorder, severe"" seems clear, alongside ""Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent."" But with his current low mood, using ""unspecified depressive disorder"" might work, too. 

I could include his past episodes in the diagnosis as ""Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in remission,"" but since he currently shows symptoms, I think ""in partial remission"" is better. This ensures I adhere to guidelines while capturing his history correctly as I finalize the top five diagnoses!

**Determining diagnoses**

I'm considering the best diagnoses given the user's situation, and I think ""Adjustment disorder with depressed mood"" fits well since his low mood is a reaction to his opioid addiction. His background as a minister brings in factors of guilt and shame. 

I could include ""Opioid use disorder, severe,"" ""Tobacco use disorder,"" and ""Alcohol use disorder, in sustained remission."" Finally, I would incorporate ""Major depressive disorder, recurrent, in remission."" It seems these five diagnoses will provide a comprehensive view of his condition while ensuring clarity and adherence to coding standards.

**Finalizing diagnoses**

I'm summarizing the situation: the patient has a history of major depressive episodes, chronic pain, and use of opioids and tobacco. It's likely I should consider ""Opioid use disorder, severe,"" and possibly account for withdrawal symptoms like dysphoria and muscle aches, even if they are just shy of the full criteria.

I think I’ll finalize five diagnoses: ""Opioid use disorder, severe"" (F11.20), ""Adjustment disorder with depressed mood"" (F43.21), ""Tobacco use disorder"" (F17.210), ""Alcohol use disorder, in sustained remission"" (F10.21), and ""Major depressive disorder, recurrent, in remission"" (F33.40).","1.

160,"Raymond Xavier, a divorced 29-year-old semi-employed landscaper, presented to a private psychiatrist with a complaint that his life was in a downward spiral. At the time of the appointment, he had been without a permanent home for over 6 months. He had lived in various places, including his car and friends’ homes. For over 1 month prior to presentation, he had been living in a tent in the woods. He had called his parents on his recent birthday, and they had offered to pay for substance use disorder treatment as long as they could pay directly.

Mr. Xavier reported that his problem started at age 24, when he had a new wife and young child and had taken on two jobs to make ends meet (working in a factory and as a local delivery driver). When he injured his back and could not get to work because of the pain, a friend offered him a few tablets of acetaminophen-oxycodone (Percocet). Not only did his pain disappear, but his energy and mood improved. For the first time in his life, he felt “normal and happy.”

Mr. Xavier continued to use one to four Percocet tablets per day for 1½ years. He never took more than one pill at a time. Then, at age 26, he snorted half a bag of heroin (about $5 on the street). “It took about 10 minutes, but I was transported into an indescribable euphoria. Like taking that first Percocet times 10. . . . You chase that first feeling for the rest of your life. It never repeats.” Within months of starting heroin, he began using it intravenously in an effort to glimpse the euphoria again.

After that first experience with heroin, the progression of use was rapid. Within 6 months, Mr. Xavier was unemployed, separated from his family, and homeless. “I was sleeping in my car or on the streets . . . using up to 30 bags [$300] daily.”

Mr. Xavier began to reach out for help. He enrolled in outpatient rehabilitation for opioid users. The cravings to use, even while in treatment, were intense. Mr. Xavier reported multiple relapses. He added cocaine to the heroin injections, and “speedballs” became Mr. Xavier’s drug of choice for a while, but he then returned to using only heroin. The first of multiple accidental overdoses occurred in a vacant house when he was 27. He had been admitted to “about 10 detoxes and rehabs” but would typically relapse within hours or weeks of discharge. He had also gone sporadically to Narcotics Anonymous meetings for years.

To acquire money for his habit, he broke into homes, stole from relatives, and wrote bad checks. “Every penny went to drugs. I’m lucky not to be in prison, but not so lucky in that everybody hates me.”

He decided to move to Martha’s Vineyard a year prior to the consultation because it “sounded like a quiet place.” He brought some methadone with him, but the eventual withdrawal was “fierce.”

He continued to use heroin and oxycodone when he could easily get them. Otherwise, he drank alcohol heavily, although he said, “I need to stop drinking—that’s what really gets me in trouble.” He also took diazepam (Valium) sporadically; however, he did not consider that to be a problem but more of a way to get through the day.

He worked occasionally as a landscaper. His boss—someone he had met at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting—had made it clear that he would call when there was extra work to be done, but that until Mr. Xavier got clean, the boss would not actually expect him to show up. He had held a variety of other odd jobs, including office supplies salesman, veterinary assistant, and gas station attendant. He had not seen his daughter in over 2 years.

On examination, Mr. Xavier appeared somewhat unkempt. He was generally cooperative but appeared restless, and at one point he urgently left the room; when he returned, he reported that he was experiencing bouts of diarrhea. His pupils were enlarged and his skin was remarkable for sweating and piloerection. He yawned several times and appeared irritable and unhappy. His arms and legs frequently twitched. He repeatedly blew his nose and appeared tearful. His speech was rapid, and he appeared impatient. He denied psychotic symptoms, suicidality, and homicidality. He said he was hopeful that if he could get some Suboxone (buprenorphine and naloxone), he might be able to keep a job and maybe get to be a real father.

I'm looking into how F13.90 corresponds to unspecified sedative-related disorders, but that doesn't quite match DSM-5 terminology. The DSM-5 has various categories for sedative use disorders, including unspecified ones. I should focus on the actual DSM diagnoses like Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder or similar. The main task is to provide a structured list of the top five DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses along with their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes without adding any extras.

**Determining likely diagnoses**

I need to interpret the information carefully to identify potential diagnoses. I can propose likely diagnoses, but they must strictly be based on the provided information without adding new details. ""Opioid use disorder, severe"" and ""opioid withdrawal"" are definite. ""Alcohol use disorder"" and ""cocaine use disorder"" seem likely, while ""sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder"" is uncertain. It's better to include ""stimulant (cocaine) use disorder, in sustained remission"" since he stopped using cocaine recently, focusing only on heroin.

**Assessing substance use diagnosis**

I need to assess whether he has used cocaine recently, which we can't confirm. We might consider ""cocaine use disorder, in sustained remission"" if there's been no use for at least 12 months. Since he moved to Martha's Vineyard a year ago, it's possible he hasn't used cocaine since. However, he continues using heroin and oxycodone, with no current mention of cocaine. His past use of speedballs shows a pattern, but we need to establish the criteria for a diagnosis, which is tricky. Additionally, he uses alcohol heavily when opioids aren't available, but the frequency within the last year is uncertain.

**Identifying possible diagnoses**

He might meet the criteria for alcohol use disorder (AUD). He uses diazepam occasionally but doesn't see it as a problem, which could indicate misuse without meeting the full criteria for a use disorder. We might consider ""other stimulant use disorder"" or explore ADHD, as he felt normal on opioids—possibly self-medicating. However, I also think the top five diagnoses should include: 1) Opioid use disorder, severe; 2) Opioid withdrawal; 3) Alcohol use disorder; 4) Cocaine use disorder (in remission?); 5) Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder (related to diazepam). But I’m unsure if there's enough evidence for a diagnosis based on sporadic usage.

**Formulating potential diagnoses**

I need to establish the top five likely diagnoses based on the available information. For substance use, I can definitely list ""Opioid use disorder, severe,"" ""Opioid withdrawal,"" and ""Alcohol use disorder."" ""Cocaine use disorder"" might fit too, and for a fifth diagnosis, I can consider options like ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" or ""Other specified depressive disorder"" due to his described emotional state. Although diazepam use doesn't fully support a diagnosis for sedative use disorder, his pattern of alcohol consumption and withdrawal symptoms is significant. Ultimately, the final choices may be based on overarching substance-related issues.

**Evaluating potential diagnoses**

I'm considering the criteria for various diagnoses. For instance, I could explore ""Cocaine use disorder"" and ""Alcohol use disorder."" Given some sporadic use of Valium, I might consider ""Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder,"" but I'll need to limit myself to justifiable diagnoses. 

For my top picks, ""Opioid use disorder, severe,"" ""Opioid withdrawal,"" and alcohol-related issues seem solid. It's tricky to nail down a fifth, though—perhaps sticking with ""Sedative use disorder"" makes sense, despite its uncertainties. Overall, I want to ensure all my choices are grounded in the evidence I have.

**Assessing substance use disorders**

I'm weighing the evidence for different substance use disorders. For cocaine, while there's a significant pattern in using it with heroin, I don't think it meets the necessary criteria to qualify fully. However, I might still classify it under ""Stimulant use disorder.""

For the 5th diagnosis, ""Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder"" could be possible due to sporadic diazepam use; however, the evidence feels weak. So, I think my top picks will focus on substance-related disorders while ensuring they align with the individual's actual symptoms. This is crucial for getting the diagnoses right!

**Considering substance use diagnoses**

I'm reviewing the evidence to determine the most likely diagnoses for the individual. He seems to have symptoms of depression, which might be from withdrawal rather than a standalone issue. I need to assess sedative use, where diazepam is used sporadically, which complicates things.

While I think ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" could fit, I'm leaning towards including ""Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder"" as the 5th diagnosis. Ultimately, I’ll focus on the top 5 substance-related diagnoses, ensuring the codes align correctly.

**Finalizing substance use diagnoses**

For the diagnoses, I'm determining codes for opioid use disorders. Opioid withdrawal is coded as F11.23, while I’ll use F11.20 for severe opioid use disorder. For alcohol use disorder, I’m leaning towards F10.20 due to heavy drinking patterns, though F10.10 might also apply if I want to avoid overstating severity. Cocaine use disorder will be F14.20 based on injection history. I'll add mild sedative use disorder coded as F13.10 for diazepam use. Here's the structured list I settled on:

1. Opioid use disorder, severe - F11.20
2. Opioid withdrawal - F11.23
3. Alcohol use disorder - F10.20
4. Cocaine use disorder - F14.20
5. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder - F13.10

**Deciding on diagnostic codes**

I need to choose the right codes for opioid use disorder (OUD). For severe OUD with withdrawal, the appropriate code is F11.23. I could also include F11.20 for severe without complications, but since the patient is in withdrawal, that might not be consistent. I’ll focus on using F11.23 as the primary diagnosis.

For secondary diagnoses, I could list the following:

1. Opioid use disorder, severe - F11.23
2. Alcohol use disorder - F10.20
3. Cocaine use disorder - F14.20
4. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder - F13.10
5. Unspecified depressive disorder - F32.9

**Choosing diagnostic codes**

I need to define the top diagnoses clearly: 

1. Opioid use disorder, severe, likely with withdrawal – F11.23.
2. Alcohol use disorder – F10.20.
3. Stimulant (cocaine) use disorder – F14.20. 
4. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder – F13.10.
5. Possibly unspecified depressive disorder, but we’re leaning towards not including that.

I feel confident about F11.23 and F10.20, and we'll go with F13.10 for sedatives as well. Ultimately, I’ll list these diagnoses properly with their corresponding F-codes.

**Structuring final diagnoses**

I need to ensure that I present everything cleanly and according to the user's instructions. Here's the final list of diagnoses with corresponding ICD-10 F-codes, formatted as requested:

1. Opioid use disorder, severe - ICD-10 F11.20  
2. Opioid withdrawal - ICD-10 F11.23  
3. Alcohol use disorder - ICD-10 F10.20  
4. Cocaine use disorder - ICD-10 F14.20  
5. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder (diazepam) - ICD-10 F13.10

161,"Shaun Yates, a 32-year-old married African American information technology (IT) security analyst, presented for treatment with a private psychiatrist because he felt “stressed.” He and his wife have two young children, and he reports a stable social life that includes a large extended family. This was his first psychiatric evaluation. He reported no past psychiatric history.

Mr. Yates traced his increased stress to a death in his city 4 months earlier. The death was recorded on video and featured an unarmed Black man being murdered by two white off-duty policemen who had accused him of theft. Like many people, Mr. Yates first saw the video via his social media “timeline,” where it was routinely reposted by his friends. Because the murder had occurred in his hometown, it received much local attention.

Mr. Yates’s social media timeline began to fill up with other examples of police brutality toward Black men. He said he watched the videos because they were “trending” and appeared on his social media timeline abruptly, unfiltered, and without warning. In addition, he became increasingly aware of news programming, social media posts, and community memorials relating to the deaths and abuse of other Black men. Although he described trying to avoid details about these tragedies, he said that news, images, and videos were unavoidable, and he had become increasingly preoccupied with fears for the safety of his wife, his young sons, his extended family, and himself.

Mr. Yates reported that under normal circumstances, he “didn’t like to talk about this stuff,” but his wife had insisted that he get treatment because she was concerned that he “didn’t seem himself.” Mr. Yates wanted the evaluating psychiatrist to understand that he was not paranoid or overly sensitive about racism, and that up until recently, he’d been good about “compartmentalizing.” Nevertheless, he admitted that it had become difficult to stop thinking about violence against unarmed Black men. He had recently disabled his social media accounts in a proactive effort to minimize his exposure to images and commentary regarding the incidents. In addition to stopping use of social media, he reported avoidance of newspapers, the internet, and television.

Mr. Yates noted that he had also become edgy, nervous, and always on guard against attack. He had gradually reduced his explorations around the city, preferring to stay close to home. Although he had previously jogged every morning before work, he quit jogging in the local community park because he “didn’t want any trouble.” Mr. Yates reported his sleep over the past 3 months as being interrupted by vivid, disturbing dreams of being chased by police officers.

For Mr. Yates, evenings were particularly stressful, and he had recently increased his use of alcohol and cannabis to “unwind” at the end of the day. He also had begun to drink a six-pack, or more, of beer after dinner, often “passing out” in the family den. The alcohol helped him to relax, and smoking “a blunt” of marijuana before bedtime improved his sleep and reduced nightmares. He stated that the biggest problem with the cannabis was his wife’s complaining that their young children might see him using it or that his use might be detected in a random urine toxicology screen at work. Mr. Yates had been increasingly late to work but had not mentioned to his wife that he had twice been reprimanded by his supervisor for the lateness.

Mr. Yates reported first using both cannabis and alcohol at fraternity parties when he was about 19 years old. Throughout college, he smoked small amounts of marijuana once or twice weekly and rarely drank more than two beers at a time. In the decade since his college graduation, he had smoked marijuana only occasionally and tended to have no more than 1 or 2 beers on the weekend. He had never smoked tobacco or used other substances. His use of alcohol and cannabis had not increased until 3 months prior to the evaluation, after he started seeing the videos.

Mr. Yates denied experiencing feelings of worthlessness, guilt, or hopelessness. He reported no prior history of panic attacks, mania, psychosis, or obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and he had never received psychiatric hospitalization or outpatient treatment. He denied suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, or previous history of suicidality. There was no family psychiatric history aside from his father, who developed posttraumatic stress disorder following military service in Vietnam.","1. Adjustment disorder with anxiety

3. Cannabis use disorder, mild",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Determining DSM-5 diagnoses**

I’m thinking about whether ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder (PTSD-like symptoms without criterion A)"" should be the primary diagnosis. Then there’s ""Alcohol use disorder, moderate,"" but I need to consider the differential, including PTSD. They want a structured list of the top five most likely diagnoses, including the primary and four secondary diagnoses. I realize we need actual diagnoses with their ICD-10 F-codes rather than a broad differential, so we can include these specific options.

**Evaluating potential diagnoses**

I’m considering ""Substance-induced anxiety disorder"" because of increased cannabis and alcohol use, although anxiety might have preceded that. It’s possible he used substances to cope, exacerbating his anxiety. I should also think about ""Alcohol-induced sleep disorder."" Ultimately, they asked for the top five diagnoses, so I can include ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder"" (F43.8) as primary, along with four others like ""Alcohol use disorder, mild"" (F10.10) and ""Cannabis use disorder, mild"" (F12.10), but I’ll have to be careful not to be redundant with my choices.

**Choosing primary and secondary diagnoses**

I think it’s best to select one primary diagnosis and then consider other conditions like ""Alcohol use disorder."" Although ""Posttraumatic stress disorder"" (F43.10) could be a secondary option, I’m skeptical. The case involves ""racial trauma"" from media, with discussions around it in various articles. While the DSM doesn't currently include this, there might be proposals for diagnosing PTSD related to race-based trauma. However, criterion A for PTSD isn’t met strictly, which leads me to consider ""Other specified trauma-related disorder"" instead, though I can’t provide reasoning in the output.

**Examining Criterion A for PTSD**

I’m looking at DSM-5 Criterion A, which includes experiencing traumatic events directly, witnessing them, learning about them happening to close people, or having extreme exposure to details. However, exposure through media doesn’t count unless it's work-related. Since the individual isn’t a first responder and has just viewed videos on social media, criterion A isn’t met, ruling out PTSD. Instead, ""Other specified trauma and stressor-related disorder"" or ""Subthreshold PTSD"" could apply, given there are symptoms causing distress.

**Finalizing diagnoses list**

I’m considering ""Unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder,"" but we have enough details to specify it as ""Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder"" (F43.8) for the primary diagnosis. For substance use, his alcohol consumption indicates ""Alcohol use disorder, mild"" (F10.10) and ""Cannabis use disorder, mild"" (F12.10) as well. ""Insomnia disorder"" is relevant due to his sleep issues, but I may include ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety"" (F43.22) as an alternative. Ultimately, I’ll clarify a structured list of five diagnoses reflecting his condition accurately.

I'm considering the user's request for the top five most likely diagnoses. It seems I can include ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety"" as an alternative and note ""Posttraumatic stress disorder"" (PTSD) as a potential, although it may not meet criterion A due to the type of exposure (media). I will emphasize the other relevant features and structure the diagnoses: 

1. Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder (F43.8).
2. Alcohol use disorder, mild (F10.10).
3. Cannabis use disorder, mild (F12.10).
4. Adjustment disorder with anxiety (F43.22).
5. Insomnia disorder (F51.01) or Nightmare disorder (F51.5).

I'm considering the best way to categorize this case. He clearly shows marked distress, and his symptoms reflect trauma-like experiences, but I'm weighing whether ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety"" is too mild compared to ""Other specified trauma and stressor-related disorder."" Criteria for PTSD may not fully apply, so it might fit better as a primary diagnosis. 

Here's my proposed final list of diagnoses:

1. Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder (F43.8) - primary.
2. Alcohol use disorder, mild (F10.10).
3. Cannabis use disorder, mild (F12.10).
4. Adjustment disorder with anxiety (F43.22).
5. Unspecified anxiety disorder (F41.9) or Nightmare disorder (F51.5).

I'm evaluating whether he meets the criteria for Alcohol Use Disorder according to the DSM. His nightly six-pack consumption and passing out show heavy usage, but he hasn't expressed a desire to cut back. His lateness to work shows failure to meet obligations. He uses despite marital complaints, so that may count as a criterion. For cannabis use, while he uses daily, issues around impairment are less clear. 

Here's the final proposed list of diagnoses:

1. Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder (F43.8) - primary.
2. Alcohol use disorder, mild (F10.10).
3. Cannabis use disorder, mild (F12.10).
4. Adjustment disorder with anxiety (F43.22).
5. Nightmare disorder (F51.5).

I'm trying to determine the best diagnoses using DSM criteria. For nightmares, I can confirm Nightmare Disorder is coded as F51.5, which fits our needs. Insomnia Disorder is coded G47.00, but since the user requested only F-codes, I'll stick with Nightmare Disorder. 

For the final list, I can consider:

1. Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder - F43.8 (primary).
2. Alcohol use disorder, mild - F10.10.
3. Cannabis use disorder, mild - F12.10.
4. Adjustment disorder with anxiety - F43.22.
5. Unspecified anxiety disorder - F41.9.

This gives me a structured way to present the top five diagnoses.

I'm focusing on ensuring accuracy for the list of diagnoses and corresponding codes:

1. Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder - F43.8
2. Alcohol use disorder, mild - F10.10
3. Cannabis use disorder, mild - F12.10
4. Adjustment disorder with anxiety - F43.22
5. Other specified anxiety disorder - F41.8

It's crucial to ensure these codes satisfy the user's requirement of F-codes only. The reasoning behind these selections reflects his symptoms accurately within the DSM framework.

I’m evaluating the potential diagnoses and their corresponding codes:

1. Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder - F43.8
2. Alcohol use disorder, mild - F10.10
3. Cannabis use disorder, mild - F12.10
4. Adjustment disorder with anxiety - F43.22
5. Posttraumatic stress disorder - F43.10 for consideration as a potential secondary diagnosis.

I’m trying to ensure the selections reflect his experiences accurately, while also navigating overlapping symptoms and criteria for each disorder. It's important to make careful distinctions in this situation.

I’m finalizing the top five diagnoses with their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes based on the user's request:

1. Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder - F43.8
2. Adjustment disorder with anxiety - F43.22
3. Alcohol use disorder, mild - F10.10
4. Cannabis use disorder, mild - F12.10

162,"Tomás Zambrano was a 36-year-old married first-generation Hispanic man who presented to the gambling clinic at a major medical center for evaluation and treatment.

A football coach at a suburban high school, Mr. Zambrano had a 5-year-old son. He denied having any prior history of a psychiatric or substance use disorder. He was appropriately dressed and groomed, expressed himself fluently in both English and Spanish, spoke in normal tone and volume, and on examination presented with intact cognitive function and average intelligence.

Mr. Zambrano had been betting on sports and playing cards since childhood, noting in the evaluation that gambling “is part of our culture.” His own father’s favorite hobby and stress reliever had been to play poker with friends at night, and Mr. Zambrano remembered with affection the father-son camaraderie they shared on these occasions. Poker became for him a familial activity that he increasingly used to relieve work-related stress. He relished the excitement as well as the intellectual challenge and competition.

Card games did not, however, remain a benign pastime for Mr. Zambrano. He had begun to lose more money than he could afford. Over the 2 years prior to his presentation for treatment, he had gradually increased the frequency and stakes of his poker nights. When he lost, he tended to place even larger bets, convinced that the odds would favor him the following time. When he won, he felt great and would continue to play, convinced he was “on a streak.” Although losses made him feel unworthy, stupid, and irritable, he believed success would come if he could fine-tune his strategy. He felt a powerful, almost constant impulse to increase the tempo of his gambling and recover the money he had lost. When he tried to cut back on gambling, he felt irritable and preoccupied, and quickly returned to his poker nights.

By the time Mr. Zambrano presented to the gambling clinic, he felt desperate. Nightly poker had led to daytime fatigue and poor performance at his coaching job, which he had previously loved. He was consumed with thoughts about his next poker game. His wife and son had long resented his time away from the family, but his wife had just found out that he had used up his son’s college fund plus accumulated $30,000 in credit card debt. When his wife threatened to file for divorce, he felt sad and depressed and decided to seek treatment.",Gambling disorder,dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Clarifying ICD-10 Codes**

I'm focusing on the correct usage of ICD-10 F-codes. They mentioned ""ICD-10 F-code,"" not ""ICD-10-CM,"" which gets me thinking about potential confusions with letter-coded codes. F32.A is pertinent, but they may prefer numeric codes. F32.9 is well-recognized and maps to ""Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified,"" while ""Depressive disorder, unspecified"" could use F32.9 too. It seems that for unspecified, F32.A might fit, but I wonder if the user prefers avoiding letters. For bipolar and OCD, I have codes ready as well.

**Choosing Differential Diagnoses**

I'm weighing options for diagnosis. Initially, ""Other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder"" is worth considering, but maybe a better focus would be on the distinction between ""Obsessive-compulsive disorder"" and ""Gambling disorder."" If symptoms align more with gambling, we might rule out ""Unspecified impulse-control disorder"" (F63.9), even though it's a potential differential. Bipolar I disorder could also be included since mania can lead to risky behaviors. I’ll finalize the list with ""Gambling disorder"" (F63.0), ""Adjustment disorder with depressed mood"" (F43.21), and possibly ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" (F32.A or F32.9).

**Selecting Diagnoses for Evaluation**

I'm exploring the appropriate diagnoses to consider. ""Obsessive-compulsive disorder"" (F42) is relevant, but I’m debating whether to include ""Bipolar II disorder,"" since there are no clear mania/hypomania features. However, ""Bipolar II"" captures both hypomanic and depressive episodes, even if the individual doesn't fully present these symptoms. Given the situation, I might also think about ""Obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, unspecified"" (F42.9) since gambling behaviors could be misinterpreted. Ultimately, the focus will be on gambling and mood-related issues, potentially including ""Other specified depressive disorder"" (F32.8) for the depressive symptoms presented.

**Finalizing Diagnostic Options**

I’m considering a range of possible diagnoses and their relevance. Initially, I thought about ""Other specified depressive disorder,"" but I need to be cautious. ""Major depressive disorder, single episode, mild"" (F32.0) could be an option if the symptoms align, but that's unclear here. I'm also looking into ""Sleep-wake disorder"" since insomnia might cause fatigue from gambling, but it seems more due to staying up late. I'm content with the current list of DSM-5-TR codes, which includes pathological gambling (F63.0), adjustment disorder (F43.21), and unspecified depressive disorder (F32.A or F32.9).

**Finalizing Potential Diagnoses**

I’m trying to pinpoint the best diagnoses to present. For obsessive-compulsive disorder, I consider using F42, but I'm also looking at various possibilities. I think ""Gambling disorder"" (F63.0) should be the primary diagnosis, followed by ""Adjustment disorder with depressed mood"" (F43.21) and ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" (F32.A). I might also include ""Bipolar disorder, unspecified"" (F31.9) and ""Obsessive-compulsive disorder, unspecified"" (F42.9) as secondary options. This ensures a comprehensive list of the top five potential diagnoses with their corresponding codes.

**Refining Diagnostic List**

I’m considering a refined list of diagnoses. The primary diagnosis would be “Gambling disorder, moderate” (F63.0). For secondary diagnoses, I could list “Adjustment disorder with depressed mood” (F43.21), “Unspecified depressive disorder” (F32.A), “Bipolar II disorder” (F31.81), and “Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, unspecified” (F90.9). However, I must ensure they are not redundant, like having both adjustment and unspecified depressive disorder. It seems logical to present one mood disorder while allowing for some overlap in the context of treatment possibilities.

**Finalizing Diagnostic List**

I need three more diagnoses to finalize the list. I’m considering options like “Unspecified anxiety disorder” (F41.9), but it might not fit well with the case at hand. I’ll list mood disorders and potentially ADHD, but ADHD may not be strongly supported either. The finalized list could read:

1. Gambling disorder - F63.0
2. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood - F43.21
3. Major depressive disorder, unspecified - F32.9
4. Bipolar II disorder - F31.81
5. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, unspecified - F90.9

This structure keeps it coherent and relevant.

**Crafting Diagnostic List**

I’m refining the list of diagnoses. I need to ensure that the options I choose are plausible and do not contradict each other. Here’s the final list:

1. Gambling disorder - F63.0  
2. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood - F43.21  
3. Unspecified depressive disorder - F32.A  
4. Bipolar II disorder - F31.81  
5. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, unspecified - F90.9  

I want to be sure I’m providing accurate codes for these diagnoses while maintaining the clarity and structure that was requested.

**Finalizing Diagnostic Codes**

I’m finalizing the list of diagnoses, aiming for clarity and appropriateness. Here’s what I’ve come up with:

1. Gambling disorder - F63.0  
2. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood - F43.21  
3. Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified - F32.9

5. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, unspecified - F90.9  

I've thought through the possibilities and selected what seems most fitting for the situation, keeping in mind to adhere to the requirements presented.

**Finalizing Diagnosis List**

I’m narrowing down the final list of diagnoses to ensure it meets requirements. Here’s what I’ve settled on:

1. Gambling disorder - F63.0  
2. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood - F43.21  
3. Unspecified depressive disorder - F32.A  
4. Bipolar II disorder - F31.81  
5. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, unspecified - F90.9

163,"A psychiatric consultant was called to evaluate depression in Victor Alvarez, a 76-year-old widower who appeared dysphoric the day after surgery to repair a broken hip. It was late in the evening, and no one from the admitting team was available, but a social work note in the chart indicated that the patient’s fracture appeared to have been the result of his tripping in his messy apartment. The note also stated that the patient had no children or known living family.

The neighbor who had brought Mr. Alvarez to the hospital had stated that the patient had been more reclusive in recent years and that his self-care had worsened after his wife’s death 6 months earlier. Up until the day of the surgery, however, he had been able to function independently in his apartment. The neighbor, a nurse, also mentioned that while they were waiting for the ambulance, her husband had sat with Mr. Alvarez while she searched the apartment for pill bottles. She said she had found only an unopened bottle of acetaminophen and a dusty bottle of a medication used for hypertension.

Routine admission laboratory results indicated that Mr. Alvarez had an elevated blood urea nitrogen level, a low albumin level, and a high normal mean corpuscular volume. His blood pressure was 160/110. In addition to medications related to the surgery, the chart indicated that he had received haloperidol 2 mg after a bout of agitation. A nursing note 1 hour after the haloperidol administration indicated that the patient was “worried and stiff.”

On mental status examination, Mr. Alvarez was lying at a 45-degree angle in his unkempt bed. He appeared thin and had moderate temporal wasting. His affect was sad, worried, and constricted. He appeared stiff and uncomfortable. He did not immediately respond to the interviewer’s questions and comments. His eyes remained generally shut, but they did flicker open a few times, and his body habitus implied that he was awake. After multiple efforts, the psychiatrist was able to get the patient to say “I’m fine” and “Get out.” When asked where he was, Mr. Alvarez said, “My apartment.” When he did open his eyes, the patient appeared confused. He did not respond to other questions and declined to do a clock drawing test. The surgery team had called in a one-to-one companion earlier in the day, and she said that the patient was generally either asleep or trying to get out of bed and that he had not been making any sense all day.",Unspecified delirium,dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Clarifying ICD-10 Codes**

I should focus on ICD-10 F-codes as requested. There’s a chance they might also accept ICD-10-CM codes, which have letters, but to be safe, I should stick to widely recognized F-codes without letters. The DSM-5-TR uses these codes, sometimes with letters after the decimal, like F32.A for ""Depression, unspecified.” To avoid confusion, I could provide F32.9 or F32.A for ""Unspecified depressive disorder,"" as noted in the most recent DSM updates. Let’s confirm that!

**Evaluating Depressive Disorder Codes**

For the DSM-5-TR, I think unspecified depressive disorder is F32.A, but I’m not 100% sure. The user is asking for ICD-10 F-codes, so F32.9 could be an option they accept as well. The DSM-5-TR updates indicate that F32.A is indeed for ""Depression, unspecified,"" while F32.8 is for ""Other specified."" I wonder if I can include both ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" and ""Adjustment disorder with depressed mood,"" or if they are mutually exclusive? I should also consider ""Major neurocognitive disorder"" but lack evidence for that.

**Assessing Cognitive and Psychotic Disorders**

I'm considering various factors related to his condition. There's a baseline decline, like a messy apartment and poor self-care, which suggests mild neurocognitive disorder (NCD) but doesn't fit the F code. Mild NCD is G31.84, not F. I could look at options like ""Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder"" or delirium from haloperidol, but it's unlikely. ""Brief psychotic disorder"" seems confusing, and while catatonia is possible, the symptoms don’t fit perfectly. I should also note medication-induced movement disorders, but they’re not F codes either.

**Prioritizing Diagnoses**

I’m evaluating possible diagnoses, like ""Acute stress disorder,"" but that’s not fitting. The ""Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum"" also doesn’t apply here. So, for the top five, I'll consider delirium, major depressive disorder, adjustment disorder, major neurocognitive disorder, and catatonia due to another condition. Delirium seems to be the primary diagnosis reflecting his immediate state, likely due to a postoperative condition. For secondary diagnoses, I might consider adjustment disorder or major depressive disorder, but I need to base my choices solely on available information, as the evidence for alcohol use disorder isn't strong enough.

**Compiling Diagnostic Possibilities**

For the top diagnoses, I’m considering ""Alcohol use disorder,"" but prioritizing clear options is crucial. The assessment points include his unopened medications and lab results, suggesting dehydration and malnutrition rather than substance use. Delirium is likely due to a postoperative condition, so I'll make that the primary diagnosis (F05). For secondaries, options could be ""Adjustment disorder with depressed mood"" (F43.21), possibly ""Major depressive disorder"" (F32.9), ""Major neurocognitive disorder"" (F03.90), and ""Catatonia due to another condition"" (F06.1). I’ll need to consider which depressive diagnosis to choose and ensure everything aligns with DSM-5-TR criteria.

**Deciding on Diagnoses**

I’m considering several diagnoses here. Prolonged grief disorder is F43.81, but it needs symptoms for 12 months — not applicable here at only 6 months. I could include ""Other specified depressive disorder"" (F32.8) or ""Delirium due to another medical condition"" (F05). The final top 5 may include:  

1. Delirium due to another medical condition - F05  
2. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood - F43.21  
3. Unspecified depressive disorder - F32.A  
4. Major neurocognitive disorder, unspecified - F03.90  
5. Catatonia due to another medical condition - F06.1  
Let's finalize this structured list!

**Finalizing Diagnoses**

I’m weighing potential diagnoses based on the information. Although ""Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified"" (F32.9) could be included, I think ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" (F32.A) fits better due to unclear symptom criteria. 

To finalize, the top 5 diagnoses are:  
1. Delirium due to another medical condition (postoperative) - F05  
2. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood - F43.21  
3. Unspecified depressive disorder - F32.A  
4. Major neurocognitive disorder, unspecified - F03.90  
5. Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition - F06.1  

I’ll choose F32.A to align with DSM-5-TR, considering the context.

**Compiling Final Diagnoses**

I’m considering the best way to finalize the top 5 diagnoses. It seems like adjustment disorder fits, but I also want to ensure we don’t exceed five entries. I’m leaning toward ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" (F32.A) for alignment with DSM-5-TR, as it’s appropriate here.

So, the final list I'll produce is:  
1. Delirium due to another medical condition (postoperative) - F05  
2. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood - F43.21  
3. Unspecified depressive disorder - F32.A

165,"Arthur Cullman, a 71-year-old married man, was referred to a psychiatrist by his primary care physician for evaluation of depressive symptoms that had not responded to medication trials. His wife reported that Mr. Cullman had begun to change at age 68, about a year after his retirement. He had gradually stopped playing golf and cards, activities he had enjoyed “for decades.” He had explained that seeing his friends was no longer “fun,” and he generally refused to socialize. Instead, he sat on the couch all day, worrying about finances and the future. He denied sadness, however, and any suicidal or homicidal ideation. His wife said he was sleeping 10–12 hours a day instead of his customary 7 hours and that he had, uncharacteristically, gained 8 pounds in less than 1 year.

His wife had become worried that retirement had left Mr. Cullman depressed, and she had mentioned her concerns to their primary care physician. Their physician agreed and prescribed sertraline (titrated to 100 mg/day for 8 months) and then sustained-release venlafaxine (titrated to 150 mg twice daily and maintained at that level for over 1 year). Mr. Cullman’s symptoms gradually worsened during these medication trials, and the internist ultimately referred him for a psychiatric evaluation.

Mr. Cullman’s past psychiatric history was notable for an episode in his 20s when he had difficulty at work, felt apathetic and unconnected, and had difficulty concentrating. These symptoms persisted for several months and resolved without treatment as his work situation improved.

Mr. Cullman’s family history was positive for a single major depressive episode in one of his two younger brothers; the depression responded well to psychotherapy and an antidepressant medication. His mother had developed dementia in her 70s.

Mr. Cullman’s personal history revealed unremarkable development and childhood, graduation from college with a degree in business, a successful career as a corporate manager, and retirement at age 67. He and his wife had been married for 45 years, denied significant discord, and had three children and four grandchildren who were in good health. Premorbidly, he had been outgoing, energetic, and well organized.

Mr. Cullman’s medical history was notable for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He was taking lisinopril, metformin, simvastatin, and venlafaxine.

Mental status examination revealed an alert, cooperative man who was neatly dressed and who had a steady but slow gait and no abnormal movements other than psychomotor slowing. Mr. Cullman’s speech was soft in volume but normal in rate and rhythm, without paraphasic errors. He had a limited range of emotional expression, denied feeling sad or guilty, but felt he had retired too early. He denied self-blame, hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts or plans. He was aware that his wife was concerned and acknowledged that he was less energetic and active than in the past. He ascribed these changes to his retirement. He said he was generally satisfied with his life.

On cognitive examination, Mr. Cullman was oriented except for the date. He remembered one of three objects in 2 minutes, performed three of five serial 7 subtractions correctly, named four common objects correctly, and repeated a complex sentence accurately. He was able to draw the face of a clock and place the numbers correctly but was not able to correctly place the hands at 10 minutes after 2. His blood pressure was 142/82, and his pulse was 84 and regular. His physical examination was noncontributory. His neurological examination revealed intact cranial nerves and 1+ symmetric deep tendon reflexes.",Major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease,dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Assessing cognitive decline**

I need to examine the timeline: starting at age 68, there have been gradual changes, and now at 71, symptoms are worse over those three years. Cognitive deficits may indicate early dementia. By the three-year mark, we’d expect significant impairment affecting independence, but since he's retired, daily demands are low. Although he seems unimpaired in tasks, ceasing social activities shows functional decline. DSM criteria require interference with everyday activities, not just hobbies, but his couch-sitting could also stem from apathy rather than impairment. He might fit ""Mild neurocognitive disorder,"" but it doesn't use an F-code.

**Exploring cognitive disorder codes**

I might consider F06.7 for mild cognitive disorder, but DSM-5 doesn’t include that. According to ICD-10, F06.7 is for mild cognitive disorder due to a known medical condition, while DSM-5's mild NCD corresponds to ICD-10 code 331.83 (G31.84), which isn't an F-code. I should focus on DSM-5-TR codes since they align with ICD-10-CM. The unspecified neurocognitive disorder does have an F-code: 294.9 (F09), which can be used when cognitive deficits are present but lack sufficient detail—potentially applicable here.

**Considering diagnostic codes**

F09 refers to an unspecified mental disorder due to a known physiological condition. I need to think about F03.90 for unspecified dementia without behavioral disturbance, as DSM uses this code for unspecified major NCD—294.20 (F03.90) and 294.21 (F03.91) with behavioral disturbance. If we suspect dementia but aren't sure of the cause, listing both could work. For top diagnoses, I’ll suggest major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s with behavioral disturbance and also include unspecified major NCD, along with other conditions like major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety. I have to make sure everything's accurate based on the information provided.

**Evaluating major depressive disorder criteria**

I need to be cautious about claiming he meets criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) if he doesn't clearly show five symptoms. Looking at the DSM-5-TR criteria for major depressive episodes, he has symptoms like anhedonia, sleep changes, weight gain, psychomotor retardation, and diminished concentration. That's five symptoms there. I believe they're present nearly every day for at least two weeks—likely even for three years. Plus, there's clinical distress and impairment, as he's stopped socializing and sits on the couch. So, he may indeed meet the criteria for MDD.

**Assessing depressive disorder diagnosis**

He denies a sad mood, but since he has anhedonia, MDD is still possible. While he also denies feelings of guilt, suicidality, or hopelessness, these aren't strictly needed. I'll consider ""Major depressive disorder with atypical features"" due to hypersomnia and weight gain, though mood reactivity isn't clear. Alternatively, we might look at neurocognitive disorders linked to vascular issues because of risk factors and psychomotor slowing. His symptoms of slowed processing and gait disturbance suggest vascular dementia could fit, along with possible ""Depressive disorder due to another medical condition."" However, I need to ensure clarity in diagnosis based on DSM criteria. It's complicated, but he might have MDD, potentially recurrent, owing to symptoms lasting three years. I need to finalize which diagnosis aligns best with the information I have.

**Identifying potential diagnoses**

The current symptoms have gradually developed over years, which poses some challenges for identifying MDD, since it usually requires at least two weeks of noticeable symptoms. There have been medication trials that didn’t alleviate symptoms, suggesting potential underlying issues. Although he denies sadness, he exhibits anhedonia and cognitive deficits, complicating the distinctions between depression and dementia. I need to develop a list of the top five likely diagnoses: including major neurocognitive disorder and major depressive disorder, along with their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes. It's important to ensure that the codes align with the correct DSM-5-TR classifications.

**Clarifying diagnostic options**

F00 codes pertain to dementia in Alzheimer's disease, including various subtypes. Since the individual began showing symptoms at age 68, that categorizes it as late onset, leading to F00.11 with behavioral disturbance, which fits given the apathy and depressive symptoms. The primary diagnosis might lean toward major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease. Secondary diagnoses could include major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and possibly major neurocognitive disorder due to vascular disease. I’ll ensure to list them clearly with their ICD-10 F-codes, reflecting plausible differentials based solely on the information and clinical considerations available.

**Exploring diagnostic options**

I’m considering the overlapping presentations of major depressive disorder (MDD) versus depressive disorder due to another medical condition. It seems best to include depressive disorder due to a neurocognitive disorder as secondary rather than MDD since the patient denies negative mood indicators. With functional decline, it suggests primary diagnosis could be major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's. 

For secondary diagnoses, I'm contemplating vascular dementia, major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and perhaps an unspecified depressive disorder instead of adjustment disorder. I'll confirm all ICD-10 codes and select the most plausible options.

**Determining top diagnoses**

I’m considering possible diagnoses for the patient, focusing on major neurocognitive disorder (NCD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). I realize I need to establish clear F-code categories for Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia, as well as for depression and anxiety.

I think I’ve narrowed it down: primary diagnosis could be major NCD due to Alzheimer’s with behavioral disturbance, followed by vascular NCD, then MDD, and possibly depressive disorder due to a medical condition. Generalized anxiety disorder is still in the mix as well. It's crucial we rank these five based on likelihood!

**Comparing diagnoses**

I’m weighing neurocognitive disorder against depression based on the patient's symptoms. He’s showing gradual behavioral changes, denies depressive moods, and has cognitive deficits. This leans toward a neurocognitive disorder, possibly Alzheimer's or vascular. Given family history and memory issues, I think primary could be major NCD due to Alzheimer's. 

For secondaries, I might list major depressive disorder, depressive disorder due to another medical condition, and generalized anxiety disorder. It’s essential to focus on what seems most likely while sticking with the top five diagnoses.

**Evaluating depressive symptoms**

The main concern here is that depressive symptoms aren't responding, potentially due to dementia or vascular issues. When examining the patient's mental state, he shows limited emotional expression and denies feelings of sadness or guilt. He seems more apathetic than depressed, attributing his low energy to retirement. Given these observations, apathy might stem from dementia rather than depression. Still, I need to list the top 5 diagnoses while ensuring I include accurate codes from the DSM-5-TR.

**Clarifying F-codes for diagnoses**

I need to ensure I'm using the correct F-codes as part of the DSM-5-TR guidelines. The user requested valid codes, so I’m considering widely recognized options like F00.11, F01.51, F32.1, F41.1, and F06.31. However, I worry about whether these codes have been updated with new specifications. For instance, newer codes might exist, but I can't verify right now. My goal is to mix current ones with stable, previously used codes to avoid confusion while ensuring accuracy.

**Selecting appropriate diagnoses and codes**

The user is asking for ICD-10 F-codes, so I need to rely on DSM-5-TR and ICD-10-CM codes typically used in psychiatry. For example, F00.11 for Alzheimer's dementia and F01.51 for vascular dementia. It's vital to ensure these codes reflect current use and are accurate. I should also consider using ""Major neurocognitive disorder due to vascular disease"" to align with DSM terminology. For the required five diagnoses, it may be appropriate to include options like ""Unspecified neurocognitive disorder"" or ""Major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal degeneration"" based on symptoms observed.

**Determining primary and secondary diagnoses**

I'm considering the top five diagnoses based on symptoms presented. These include ""Major neurocognitive disorder due to vascular disease"" and ""Major depressive disorder."" The patient's profile suggests he may lean toward Alzheimer's or a vascular contribution, but without imaging, it's tricky. I think ""Major neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies"" fits well. However, its coding needs clarity. There's also the option for unspecified neurocognitive disorders. After weighing evidence, I’m leaning toward Alzheimer's as the primary due to insidious onset and family history, with secondary diagnoses including major depressive disorder.

**Finalizing secondary diagnoses**

I'm narrowing down the secondary diagnoses. They include ""Major neurocognitive disorder due to vascular disease"" and ""Major depressive disorder,"" considering behaviors and symptoms like anxiety. I also have to ensure these fit with ICD-10 F-codes. So, I need to clarify codes: for Alzheimer's, it’s F00.11; vascular NCD is F01.51; for MDD, it’s F32.1, and for generalized anxiety, F41.1. Lastly, for frontotemporal degeneration, I can use F02.81, which applies to dementia in other diseases. I’ll finalize the list to stay organized and concise!

**Finalizing secondary diagnoses**

In considering possible diagnoses, I recognize that persistent depressive disorder may not apply since the individual denies sadness. However, I’m including it as a differential. Major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal degeneration fits well, while Parkinson's due to slow gait seems less plausible without other symptoms. I need to stick to ICD-10 F-codes for the structured list: Alzheimer’s at F00.11, vascular NCD at F01.51, MDD at F32.1, generalized anxiety at F41.1, and I’m deciding between F02.81 and F03.91 for frontotemporal. Let's finalize this!

**Exploring dementia coding structures**

I’m recalling how the new ICD-10 codes work, especially around dementia. For instance, F00.A0 could represent early onset Alzheimer's without behavioral disturbance. The letters after the decimal may indicate severity: A for mild, B for moderate, C for severe. I need to be careful about onset versus severity distinctions. I think there are also separate codes for early, late, and atypical onset. So, I'm piecing together how the coding structure incorporates these important nuances. Let's clarify this further!

**Deciding on diagnostic codes**

I’m thinking about which ICD-10 codes to use for dementia. There are these options: we could stick with the old ICD-10-CM codes like F00.11 and F02.81, or we might consider the base ICD-10 codes like F00.1 and F02.0. The user expects the US-specific codes for precision, but general codes might be acceptable. Overall, it seems best to ensure we provide the correct DSM-5-TR codes to avoid any confusion, especially as a resident.

**Checking dementia codes**

I’m trying to clarify whether the DSM-5-TR uses new dementia codes that include severity. I recall seeing a table for ""Major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease,"" which mentions the G code, specifically G30.9. However, the user is looking for F codes, which adds a layer of confusion. It seems like DSM-5 doesn’t use F00.* for Alzheimer’s but instead relies on G30.9. I need to ensure I'm clear on how DSM-5 codes neurocognitive disorders to avoid any mistakes.

**Reviewing neurocognitive disorder codes**

I’m trying to piece together how the DSM codes neurocognitive disorders, particularly for conditions like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. I see that ""Major neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson's disease"" is coded as 332.0 (G20), while it mentions behavioral disturbances with 294.11 (F02.81). For Alzheimer's, there's a note that says to first code G30.9, followed by either F02.80 or F02.81 based on behavioral disturbances. It looks like Alzheimer’s major NCD could simply be 331.0 (G30.9) without involving F codes. This can get a bit confusing!

**Recalling dementia billing codes**

I’m reflecting on the billing codes I used for dementia due to Alzheimer's. I remember using F02.80 alongside G30.9, and sometimes including F03.90. There's a coding instruction in ICD-10-CM that suggests first coding the underlying condition, like Alzheimer's (G30.-), and then adding a code for dementia with behavioral disturbances (F02.80). It seems the combination of G30.- and F02.* ensures accurate billing and captures the full picture of the patient's condition.

**Finalizing diagnoses list**

I’m thinking about the proper diagnoses phrasing. I see that F02.81 is for dementia related to other diseases with behavioral disturbance, which includes frontotemporal dementia. Next, I'll decide whether to use ""Major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease"" or ""Probable major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease.” I'll keep it straightforward and ensure the list doesn’t exceed five items, avoiding extra punctuation. I'll list them with their F-codes and double-check that all codes start with F before finalizing.","1.

166,"Betty Drucker, a 76-year-old white woman, was experiencing sad mood, diminished interest in activities that had given her pleasure in the past, neglect of her personal appearance and household responsibilities, feelings of insecurity when interacting with others, and difficulties in concentration and word finding. She had reduced her social interactions, stopped going to her senior citizens center, and dropped out of her weekly card game because she experienced no pleasure and could not adequately concentrate. She had lost 7 pounds in the prior 2 months, and her sleep was interrupted by periods of insomnia with agonizing ruminations. This was the first time she had experienced any psychiatric symptoms.

Ms. Druker had retired 10 years earlier after a successful career as an attorney. She had been divorced for 30 years. Her two children and three grandchildren lived nearby, and she had been seeing them often before this episode.

Ms. Drucker had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of coronary occlusion for which she had received a stent. She was taking hydrochlorothiazide, the angiotensin receptor inhibitor olmesartan, atorvastatin, and low-dose aspirin. She had smoked half a pack of cigarettes per day for about 30 years.

On examination, Ms. Drucker was disheveled and appeared drained of energy. She took a long time to respond to questions. She had a depressed, anxious mood and a sad affect, and was preoccupied with her finances but could be temporarily reassured. She complained of forgetfulness; on examination, she was able to recall two out of four objects in 3 minutes and recognized a third when given several choices. She could think of 14 items available in a supermarket over a period of 1 minute. She failed to cluster items of similar kind. Ms. Drucker had difficulty producing a list of vegetables alternating with items of clothing; she produced 12 correct responses and 4 errors. She spaced the hours unequally in drawing a clock but placed the hands correctly. The patient’s Mini-Mental State Examination score was 24. She gave 22 correct responses over 1 minute in the Stroop Test, which measures “response inhibition” by asking the person to identify the color of ink in which incongruous words are written (e.g., the word “RED” written in blue ink).

A neurological examination was essentially unremarkable, with the exception of a mild drop on the left side of her mouth. A CT head scan revealed pronounced periventricular and subcortical white matter hyperintensities.","1. Major depressive disorder
2. Mild neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Evaluating cognitive disorders**

I think the vignette is comparing major depressive disorder with cognitive impairment to vascular dementia. I'll look at cognitive tests like recalling objects, which shows retrieval issues, while not clustering items hints at executive dysfunction. Errors in alternating tasks and uneven spacing in clock drawing point to visuospatial problems. With significant white matter hyperintensities, there could be signs of vascular disease affecting cognition. Since there's also depression and anxiety, it seems her functioning has been disrupted more by her mood.

**Assessing possible diagnoses**

The user might be focusing on finances but seems to be temporarily reassured. I wonder if the primary diagnosis is major depressive disorder with melancholic features. She shows signs of anhedonia, weight loss, and psychomotor retardation. However, I note that she lacks some key melancholic features. Anxiety symptoms, like a depressed anxious mood and preoccupation with finances, could suggest generalized anxiety disorder, but I need to remember that this may just be linked to her depression. There's also a possibility of mild neurocognitive disorder from vascular disease.

**Clarifying diagnostic codes**

I’m looking into the differences between DSM-5 and ICD-10 for neurocognitive disorders. The DSM-5 uses ""major"" or ""mild"" neurocognitive disorder, with major vascular corresponding to F01.50. Mild vascular NCD is mapped to G31.84, which isn't an F-code. The user says I shouldn’t include non-psychiatric diagnoses without F-codes. But I also wonder if there’s an F-code for mild NCD—it's a bit unclear. Some mild NCD cases in DSM-5 use G codes, which may not fit the user's guidelines.

**Mapping diagnostic codes**

I see that ICD-10 includes F06.7 for mild cognitive disorder, which is a mental disorder caused by a known physiological condition. However, the user questions point out they want ICD-10 F-codes for mental and behavioral disorders, so F06.7 would be a suitable choice if I'm looking at mild cognitive disorder. I need to check if F06.7 is included in DSM-5-TR. Honestly, the key requirement is to list only diagnoses that have F-codes, so I need to ensure I’m matching everything correctly!

**Assessing diagnostic criteria**

I need to determine if the major neurocognitive disorder due to vascular disease is labeled F01.50 or F01.51. Major symptoms indicate significant cognitive decline affecting independence. There are signs she may struggle with daily tasks, possibly due to depression rather than cognitive impairment. Her MMSE indicates mild impairment, and pronounced white matter hyperintensities on CT could suggest small vessel disease. The diagnostic focus might be ""depression with vascular cognitive impairment."" Ultimately, I need to find appropriate F-coded diagnoses as per DSM-5-TR guidelines while analyzing her detailed symptoms.

**Evaluating diagnoses and codes**

I'm looking at various diagnostic codes for neurocognitive disorders. Major NCD due to Alzheimer's uses G30.9 with F02.80/81, which includes an F-code for dementia. Mild NCD doesn't seem to carry an F code, instead using G31.84. Since my task is to list diagnoses strictly with F-codes, major NCD is an option if it consistently interferes with independence, despite some evidence being borderline. I may want to consider listing ""Major Depressive Disorder"" or ""Depressive Disorder due to another medical condition"" as well. I'll have to ensure I provide a clear top five diagnoses while avoiding overlaps.

**Proposing likely diagnoses**

I'm considering the most suitable diagnoses for a 76-year-old patient with new-onset depression and cognitive difficulties. This situation could suggest major depressive disorder or vascular contributions. The symptoms fit ""vascular depression,"" often linked to cerebrovascular disease, but causality can be tricky. 

I should prioritize major depressive disorder as there's clear evidence of impairment, possibly with a code of F32.2 for severity. For secondary diagnoses, I might list major vascular neurocognitive disorder as a possibility along with unspecified neurocognitive disorder. These could capture the cognitive aspects while ensuring I adhere to the F-code requirements.

**Evaluating diagnosis options**

I'm working through the appropriate diagnoses for a patient showing signs of depression and cognitive difficulties. I need to consider major neurocognitive disorder but question if there’s sufficient evidence to meet that diagnosis. I'm leaning towards major depressive disorder as the primary diagnosis due to the significant depressive symptoms observed.

In terms of secondary options, I could consider depressive disorder due to cerebrovascular disease and major neurocognitive disorders tied to vascular issues. The situation needs careful evaluation because some diagnoses can’t co-occur. My top five list will reflect these considerations, ensuring each choice fits well within the patient's presentation and diagnostic criteria.

**Assessing cognitive and mood disorders**

I'm re-evaluating the cognitive data of a patient who was previously a successful attorney, but is now showing signs of decline, as indicated by an MMSE score of 24. This could suggest early stages of neurocognitive disorder, especially considering executive dysfunction and cognitive difficulties. 

I need to consider that her financial preoccupations might indicate anxiety, possibly due to cognitive decline. For diagnoses, I should prioritize possible primary and secondary diagnoses, focusing on realistic options based on the available information while considering the structural requirements of the vignette.

**Clarifying diagnostic criteria**

I’m considering how to best categorize the patient's symptoms using appropriate codes. The major vascular neurocognitive disorder might be coded as F01.51, while major depressive disorder could be F32.x. It appears the vignette asks for top diagnoses that specifically require F codes. I need to ensure we don’t overshoot with non-psychiatric diagnoses while including the necessary cognitive impairment.

I'm contemplating if depression might be a part of her neurocognitive disorder, indicating vascular depression. Given her age and symptoms, this could support diagnosing her based on vascular changes.

**Determining appropriate diagnoses**

I’m considering how to categorize the patient's symptoms effectively. The CT findings might indicate ""Major depressive disorder, single episode"" alongside ""mild neurocognitive disorder due to vascular disease."" The tricky part is whether to categorize her with major neurocognitive disorder due to vascular changes or as having a depressive disorder caused by medical conditions.

Based on the symptoms presented, I’m leaning towards listing major depressive disorder as the primary diagnosis while exploring other options like neurocognitive disorders as secondary diagnoses to maintain clarity and support the criteria effectively.

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

I’m considering the symptoms and codes I should include for this case. Many older adults with depression may neglect grooming and responsibilities, which can lead to being disheveled and drained of energy. Given that she dropped out of social activities but is still responsive, I think we can categorize her condition carefully.

Here's my final list of diagnoses with corresponding codes:  
1. Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe without psychotic features - F32.2  
2. Depressive disorder due to another medical condition, with major depressive-like episode - F06.32  
3. Major vascular neurocognitive disorder, with behavioral disturbance - F01.51

167,"Carl Estel, a 74-year-old right-handed married man, was brought for a neuropsychiatric evaluation after a multi-year decline marked by stiffness, forgetfulness, and apathy. His wife had been trying to get him in for an evaluation for years and had finally become desperate enough to enlist his brothers to bring him for the evaluation.

Mrs. Estel described her husband’s problems as starting when he retired from his job as a plumbing contractor at age 65. He had seemed “out of sorts” almost immediately, and she had wondered at the time whether he was getting depressed. He became uncharacteristically forgetful, misplacing items and neglecting to pay bills. He had trouble with appointments, medications, and calculations. He had refused to see a physician until he was involved in a traffic accident a few years prior to this evaluation. At that time, a physician had found no significant physical injuries but had said that the accident was caused by inattention and diminished depth perception; she had recommended that Mr. Estel stop driving, and suggested that he get a more thorough evaluation for early dementia.

Over the past year, things had gotten worse. Mr. Estel often could not recall the outcome of sporting events that he had just watched on television, although his memory improved with cues. He resisted activities such as travel and socializing that he had previously enjoyed. A former athlete, he stopped taking walks around the neighborhood after several falls. He quit playing cards with neighbors because the rules had become confusing. He looked depressed and acted apathetic but generally said he was fine. His judgment and problem-solving skills appeared to have significantly declined. Despite having completed 4 years of college and worked for many years as a successful professional plumber, Mr. Estel was now periodically unable to operate household appliances.

All of these cognitive problems seemed to fluctuate, so that his wife reported that sometimes he was “almost like his old self,” whereas at other times it was “like living with a zombie, a depressed zombie.” She also described his frequent exhaustion, daytime drowsiness, and staring spells.

When asked specifically about her husband’s sleep, Mrs. Estel reported that in fact neither of them slept well. Mainly, she said, it was because of her husband “acting out his dreams.” During these episodes, which occurred several times a month, he would punch and scream, and would occasionally fall out of bed. After sustaining bruises as a result of several of the episodes, Mrs. Estel decided it would be safer to sleep on the couch. She recalled that these sleep episodes began just before her husband retired; she had wondered at the time whether he had posttraumatic stress disorder, but she did not think he had suffered any particular trauma. A few years earlier, a friend had offered her a “sleeping pill” that had helped her own husband with dementia. Mr. Estel had responded to the unknown medication with extreme rigidity and confusion, and his wife had nearly taken him to the emergency room in the middle of the night.

Mrs. Estel denied that her husband had ever had any psychiatric illness. When asked about psychotic symptoms, she said that perhaps every week or so, he swatted at invisible things in the air. She did not think he heard voices or felt suspicious.

Mr. Estel’s medical history was notable for hypercholesterolemia, cardiovascular disease with a history of stent placement, and possible transient ischemic attacks. His family history was positive for his mother having developed dementia in her mid-70s.

On examination, Mr. Estel was a stooped, stiff man who shuffled into the office. While listening to his wife present the history, he stared into space, seeming to pay no attention to the content of the conversation. His right hand was tremulous. He appeared depressed, but when asked, he said he felt fine. His voice was so quiet that words were often unintelligible even when the interviewer leaned close. He drooled at times and did not notice until his wife wiped his chin.

When asked to participate in cognitive testing, he shrugged his shoulders and said, “I don’t know.”","1. Major neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies
2. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Assessing dementia coding**

I see that F02.81 is an F-code for dementia due to other diseases in ICD-10, and we need to choose between F02.81 or F02.80 based on behavioral disturbances. The person’s visual hallucinations and apathy suggest a major diagnosis, as their decline affects independence.

I’m considering differential diagnoses, like major vascular neurocognitive disorder or depression with cognitive impairment, but REM sleep behavior disorder is relevant as well. This is coded under G47.52, not an F-code.

**Clarifying diagnosis coding**

In DSM-5-TR, REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is classified as a parasomnia under sleep-wake disorders, which uses G codes, not F codes. Since I'm asked to provide only F-coded psychiatric diagnoses, we have to exclude RBD.

The user specified they want the top 5 DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses but also highlighted the need for corresponding ICD-10 F-codes. I can include diagnoses like Major neurocognitive disorder due to Lewy body disease (F02.81). Major depressive disorder could be secondary, but the depressive symptoms might stem from the neurocognitive disorder itself.

**Determining diagnoses**

I’m considering a few potential diagnoses. Depressive disorder due to another medical condition, like Lewy body disease with depressive features, could be F06.31. Then, there’s delirium, which seems less fitting given the patient's long-term fluctuating cognition and drowsiness.

For neurocognitive disorders, Mild neurocognitive disorder due to vascular disease doesn't seem accurate since it's already major. Major neurocognitive disorder is allowed under multiple etiologies per DSM-5. I might mark it as “Major neurocognitive disorder, probable, with Lewy bodies” as primary, and a secondary diagnosis could be “Major neurocognitive disorder due to vascular disease” (F01.51).

**Identifying appropriate codes**

I’m looking at various codes. F06.8 refers to other mental disorders due to physiological conditions, while unspecified neurocognitive disorder code could be F09, but actually for unidentified NCD, it's R41.9 or 799.59 in DSM-5.

I find that the primary diagnosis should be major neurocognitive disorder due to Lewy bodies. Secondary options might include major NCD due to vascular disease, given the vascular risks, possible TIAs, and falls, as well as major NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease due to age and memory issues.

**Compiling diagnoses**

It looks like I'm considering several potential diagnoses. The primary one should be major neurocognitive disorder due to Lewy body disease, which aligns with symptoms like cognitive fluctuations and visual hallucinations. I’ll be using F02.81 for this, as it addresses behavioral disturbances.

For secondary diagnoses, I'm thinking about major neurocognitive disorder due to vascular disease (F01.51) and possibly depressive disorder due to another medical condition. However, mood symptoms seem ambiguous. The instructions are clear that I need a structured list without reasoning, so I will focus on these diagnoses.

**Clarifying diagnoses**

I’m analyzing the possible diagnoses for a case with evidence of vascular disease and TIAs but a focus on fluctuating cognition. Major neurocognitive disorder (NCD) due to Lewy bodies stands out as the primary option, supported by symptoms like RBD and cognitive fluctuations. I think I’ll use F02.81, but I may also want to consider secondary options, such as major depressive disorder (F32.9) and NCD due to vascular disease (F01.51). I need to be concise and structured, ensuring all options follow the F-code requirements.

**Assessing cognitive disorders**

I’m trying to summarize the appropriate diagnostic codes for a patient with signs of dementia, particularly Lewy body dementia (LBD) and related disorders. For the top diagnoses, I think I'll definitely use F02.81 for Major NCD with Lewy bodies. Other possibilities include depressive disorder due to another medical condition (F06.31) and major NCD due to vascular disease (F01.51). It’s important to stick to F-codes only, so I’ll ensure each diagnosis is relevant and plausible within that framework.

**Determining top diagnoses**

I'm looking through potential diagnoses for someone with cognitive issues. It seems that the primary focus should be on major neurocognitive disorder due to Lewy body disease, which I can code as F02.81. I also think vascular dementia (F01.51) and dementia in Alzheimer's disease (F00.11) are solid choices. Maybe I can include depressive disorder due to another medical condition (F06.31) and a psychotic disorder due to another medical condition with hallucinations (F06.0). These should make for a strong top five, even if some are uncertain.

**Structuring psychiatric diagnoses**

I’m considering top psychiatric diagnoses, focusing on major neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies as the primary one, coded F02.81. Then I have vascular dementia (F01.51), and dementia due to Alzheimer's (F00.11). Depression due to another medical condition (F06.31) looks plausible as a secondary diagnosis, along with a psychotic disorder due to another medical condition (F06.0). However, I might instead include Parkinson's disease dementia, still adhering to the instruction of five diagnoses, even with some overlap in codes.

**Clarifying diagnostic codes**

I'm analyzing potential diagnoses, focusing on whether to include sleep-wake disorders. ""Other specified sleep-wake disorder"" (F51.8) might be useful, but there's a distinction in coding between sleep disorders in the ICD-10. I can’t include REM Sleep Behavior Disorder since it uses a G-code. I'll have to stick to F-codes only, possibly considering unspecified disorders or parasomnias. However, the end goal is to produce a structured list of diagnoses adhering to user instructions while ensuring all entries have their corresponding F-codes.

**Structuring psychiatric diagnoses**

I’m working on a structured list of the top 5 psychiatric diagnoses, focusing on their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes. The primary diagnosis is “Major neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies.” For the secondary diagnoses, I’ll include “Major neurocognitive disorder due to vascular disease,” “Major neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson's disease,” “Major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease,” and “Depressive disorder due to another medical condition.” This list needs to reflect the strongest likelihood based on the symptoms described and ensure the F-codes match correctly without additional commentary.

**Organizing neurocognitive diagnoses**

I’m sorting through the possible neurocognitive diagnoses based on prominence and likelihood. The order I’m considering is:

1. Major neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies, probable, with behavioral disturbance - F02.81.
2. Major neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson’s disease, with behavioral disturbance - F02.81.
3. Possible major vascular neurocognitive disorder, with behavioral disturbance - F01.51.
4. Possible major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease, with behavioral disturbance - F00.11.
5. Depressive disorder due to another medical condition, with depressive features - F06.31.

I must ensure that the F-codes correspond correctly while keeping the classifications relevant to the user's specifications.

**Finalizing neurocognitive disorder diagnoses**

I’m considering the inclusion of delirium but it’s less likely as a long-term condition. Instead, I’ll finalize the structured list of diagnoses:

1. Major neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies, probable, with behavioral disturbance - F02.81.
2. Major neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson’s disease, with behavioral disturbance - F02.81.
3. Possible major vascular neurocognitive disorder, with behavioral disturbance - F01.51.
4. Possible major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease, with behavioral disturbance - F00.11.
5. Depressive disorder due to another medical condition, with depressive features - F06.31.

I must ensure the list and codes align accurately with the information provided.

**Finalizing neurocognitive disorder diagnoses**

I’m weighing the possibility of including ""Major neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies"" as a secondary diagnosis, likely due to Lewy body disease and vascular issues. My main diagnoses will be:

1. Major neurocognitive disorder due to Lewy body disease, probable - F02.81.
2. Major neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson's disease, with behavioral disturbance - F02.81.
3. Major vascular neurocognitive disorder, with behavioral disturbance - F01.51.
4. Possible major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease, with behavioral disturbance - F00.11.
5. Depressive disorder due to another medical condition, with depressive features - F06.31.

I’ll ensure to structure the list clearly with appropriate ICD-10 codes.

**Crafting the final diagnosis list**

Here’s my final list of diagnoses:

1. Major neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies, probable, with behavioral disturbance - F02.81  
2. Major neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson’s disease, with behavioral disturbance - F02.81  
3. Major vascular neurocognitive disorder, possible, with behavioral disturbance - F01.51  
4. Major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease, with behavioral disturbance - F00.11  
5. Depressive disorder due to another medical condition, with depressive features - F06.31

168,"Part 1:

Dorothy Franklin, a 54-year-old married former waitress, was brought into the psychiatric emergency room (ER) by her husband for escalating delusions and visual hallucinations. Her husband reported that she had been episodically agitated for about 10 years, uncharacteristically suspicious for about 6 months, and complaining of daily hallucinations for weeks to months. The patient referred to her experience as “my nightmare.” In a terrified voice, she explained, “I see a judge standing in front of me. Plain as day. He is a good judge, but he threatens to kill me, and I can’t stop him. I can’t believe no one else can see him. Can you help?”

Mr. Franklin reports that his wife had been “completely fine” until about a decade earlier, when she was in her early 40s. At that point, he reports that she had become frequently agitated, paranoid, worried, and occasionally aggressive. He had brought her to psychiatrists and internists, and she had received several diagnoses, including late-onset schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, paranoid personality, and anxiety. She and her husband could not recall the names of all of the many psychiatric medications that she had been prescribed over the years, but they included antidepressant, antipsychotic, antianxiety, and mood-stabilizing medications.

Ms. Franklin had smoked half a pack of cigarettes a day for many years but only rarely drank alcohol and never used recreational drugs. She had worked as a waitress for 20 years but quit 10 years prior to the evaluation because of too many “dropped trays,” misremembered customer orders, and uncharacteristic irritability. Around that time, she was arrested for “hitting someone” in a shopping mall, and she and her husband decided she needed to reduce her stress level.

The patient had two healthy adult children in their late 20s. She had one sister with “depression and irritability.” The patient’s mother had passed away 10 years earlier at age 70. She had been wheelchair bound for years because of severe dementia, postural instability, and involuntary movements. The patient’s maternal grandfather “got sick” in his late 50s and completed suicide with a firearm at age 62.

On mental status examination in the ER, Ms. Franklin was frightened but cooperative. She appeared her stated age, with thin body habitus and good grooming and hygiene. She sat next to her husband, holding his hand and often looking to him when asked questions. She had moderate psychomotor slowing, and noticeable involuntary “dancelike” movements of her trunk and upper extremities. Her eye contact was intermittent but intense. Ms. Franklin described her mood as “not well at all,” and her affect was blunted and minimally reactive. Her speech was soft and slowed, with minimal spontaneity. Her thought process was linear but slowed. She was preoccupied by paranoid delusions and visual hallucinations. She reported actively hallucinating during the interview. She denied suicidal and homicidal thoughts or plans. On cognitive examination, she was alert and oriented to person, place, and time. She had good attention and concentration, although she had significant impairments in both short- and long-term memory. Her performance on the Mini-Mental State Examination and clock drawing test revealed moderate impairment in planning and visuospatial tasks.

In the ER, results from extensive laboratory testing were normal. The patient was admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit for safety and for further workup of her psychotic symptoms.

Part 2:

After Ms. Franklin was admitted to the psychiatric unit, she received brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to rule out mass lesions (e.g., tumor or stroke) and demyelinating processes (e.g., multiple sclerosis). MRI findings were normal, and the neurology department was consulted for diagnostic assistance and administration of EEG to evaluate for a possible seizure disorder. While she was actively hallucinating, Ms. Franklin’s electroencephalogram was negative for seizure activity.

Given the nature and time course of Ms. Franklin’s symptoms, coupled with her family history of dementia and delayed-onset psychiatric disturbances, the psychiatry and neurology teams became concerned about the possibility of Huntington’s disease. After extensive discussion with the patient and her spouse, she agreed to undergo genetic testing for Huntington’s disease, and the test result was positive for 44 trinucleotide (CAG) repeats. After further psychosocial and medication management, she and her husband were referred to a comprehensive outpatient Huntington’s disease clinic.","Diagnosis on Admission: 

Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder

Final Diagnoses:

1. Mild neurocognitive disorder due to Huntington’s disease

2. Psychotic disorder due to Huntington’s disease",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Evaluating cognitive decline**

I'm considering Huntington's disease and how it leads to psychiatric and cognitive symptoms. The primary diagnosis seems to be major neurocognitive disorder due to Huntington's with behavioral disturbances. The DSM-5-TR outlines that this includes a decline in cognitive domains, interference with independence, and it shouldn't be better explained by another disorder. The individual in question shows memory deficits and functional decline, like quitting her job and misremembering orders. Now, I need to determine if her cognitive decline truly interferes with her daily independence.

**Assessing cognitive impairment**

I'm considering the level of cognitive impairment here. Moderate issues with planning and visuospatial tasks suggest significant decline. Although she’s oriented and concentrated, there are memory issues, and her husband brought her in for psychosis, indicating some reliance on him. The cognitive decline seems at least moderate since she has impairments in short- and long-term memory. The MMSE and clock drawing tests support this, and quitting work ten years ago suggests interference with her ability to function occupationally.

**Determining NCD classification**

I’m weighing whether this case falls under major neurocognitive disorder (NCD). Quitting her job is usually a strong indicator of major NCD since it typically implies an inability to maintain employment. While she appears oriented and attentive, her memory is significantly impaired, which complicates the decision. I should lean toward major NCD due to the moderate impairment and functional decline. Psychotic symptoms might relate to Huntington’s disease, so we might not need to consider a separate disorder. Coding-wise, major NCD related to Huntington's with behavioral disturbance uses specific codes, which I'm looking to clarify.

**Clarifying diagnostic codes**

I'm diving into the ICD-10 and DSM-5 codes related to major neurocognitive disorder (NCD) due to Huntington's disease. It seems F02.81 relates to behavioral disturbance, while F02.80 doesn't include that. In DSM-5, I see that major NCD due to Huntington's uses the code 331.2, but I need to check if that's outdated. I'd generally use F02.81 for coding, alongside G10 for Huntington's. Now, I've got to list the top five likely diagnoses with their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes, balancing primary and secondary diagnoses correctly.

**Formulating a diagnosis list**

I'm assessing the diagnoses for a patient likely affected by Huntington's disease and its related symptoms. While ""Unspecified psychotic disorder"" might not be required, I can clearly specify ""Psychotic disorder due to Huntington's disease"" (F06.2). Considering cognitive deficits, I lean towards major NCD as a primary diagnosis. I need to provide a structured list of up to five likely psychiatric diagnoses. Given the positive genetic test, major NCD due to Huntington's with behavioral disturbance and psychotic disorder due to another medical condition are strong candidates. Other possible diagnoses might include anxiety disorders and personality changes, acknowledging the nuances of her symptoms.

**Assessing potential diagnoses**

The patient denies suicidal thoughts, and we don't have enough information for a major depressive disorder (MDD) diagnosis. However, ""unspecified depressive disorder"" (F32.A) could be applicable if distress is present. She's worried and suspicious, potentially indicating anxiety, but not enough evidence for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). 

Next, I need to provide five diagnoses with corresponding ICD-10 F-codes, focusing on her symptoms and medical condition. The top diagnoses will likely include major NCD due to Huntington's and a psychotic disorder due to Huntington's. I'll double-check the codes for accuracy!

**Choosing appropriate diagnoses**

I’m narrowing down potential diagnoses based on the evidence available. The main ones seem to include major NCD due to Huntington's disease with behavioral disturbance, psychotic disorder due to Huntington's, tobacco use disorder, and possibly unspecified depressive and anxiety disorders. However, only five slots are available.

While considering what to include, I must ensure that each diagnosis is well-supported and that their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes are accurate. F02.81 for major NCD, F06.2 for the psychotic disorder, F07.0 for personality change, F17.200 for tobacco use, and F41.9 for unspecified anxiety disorder look promising!

**Determining primary diagnoses**

I’m focusing on selecting the most appropriate diagnoses, with major NCD due to Huntington's disease as the likely primary condition, fitting the F-code requirement. The psychosis associated with it complicates the picture, but it seems that major NCD due to Huntington's is what best captures the overarching issues. Still, I’m evaluating whether to include a psychotic disorder as a secondary diagnosis since she displays significant cognitive decline and psychiatric symptoms. 

While multiple diagnoses are expected, I should ensure not to be redundant and to support each diagnosis with available evidence!

**Selecting diagnoses for Huntington's**

I’m exploring various potential diagnoses for a case involving Huntington's disease. Major neurocognitive disorder due to Huntington's seems clear for the primary diagnosis, supported by evidence of cognitive decline and behavioral disturbances. The psychosis could relate to Huntington's as well, possibly coded under a psychotic disorder. However, I still need to narrow down to the top five diagnoses, ensuring they are well-supported while avoiding redundancy. I’ll finalize the list of diagnoses, keeping the specific F-codes in mind!

**Finalizing psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm evaluating primary and secondary diagnoses for a patient with Huntington's disease. The primary diagnosis could be ""Psychotic disorder due to Huntington's disease,"" with ""Major neurocognitive disorder"" as secondary because of cognitive deficits. I also need to consider other conditions like personality change or tobacco use disorder. For the fifth diagnosis, I'm leaning towards ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" or ""Unspecified depressive disorder,"" as mood symptoms are present but do not fully meet criteria. I’ll finalize the list of five diagnoses and their corresponding F-codes.

**Listing psychiatric diagnoses**

For the diagnosis, I’m considering: ""Major neurocognitive disorder due to Huntington's disease, with behavioral disturbance"" as a primary diagnosis (F02.81) and ""Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition (Huntington's disease)"" as secondary (F06.2). Then, there's ""Tobacco use disorder,"" which I can specify more accurately as ""Nicotine dependence, cigarettes, uncomplicated"" (F17.210). For anxiety, I might settle on ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" (F41.9). Finally, I could include ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" as the last entry since depression can be common in such cases.

**Selecting potential diagnoses**

I'm considering the possible diagnoses for this patient. The top five could include ""Major neurocognitive disorder due to Huntington's disease, with behavioral disturbance"" (F02.81), ""Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.2), and ""Depressive disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.31). For the fourth, I think ""Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.4) may work, depending on prominence. Lastly, ""Tobacco use disorder"" (F17.210) fits well. I also wonder if ""Personality change due to another medical condition"" (F07.0) should replace one of these. Balancing clarity and symptoms is essential here.

**Finalizing the diagnoses**

I'm careful to ensure we have enough evidence for each diagnosis. The primary diagnosis will be ""Major NCD due to Huntington's"" with behavioral disturbance. For the second diagnosis, I propose ""Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition."" The third could be ""Personality change due to another medical condition,"" while the fourth could be ""Tobacco use disorder."" Lastly, for the fifth, I think ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" fits best since her worry and agitation suggest clinically significant distress. I want to keep the list clear and concise, prioritizing the most directly supported diagnoses.

**Double-checking ICD codes**

I’m verifying the ICD codes for the diagnoses. For the first, F02.81 aligns with major NCD due to Huntington's with behavioral disturbance. Next, F06.2 fits a psychotic disorder due to a medical condition. I'm also confirming personality change with F07.0, and F17.210 works for tobacco use disorder. Lastly, for anxiety, I see F41.9 is appropriate. 

When presenting, I’ll ensure to keep minimal details and avoid punctuation. The final list will just include the diagnoses in a numbered format without extra info.

**Determining top diagnoses**

I need to approach the differential diagnoses carefully. The user asked for the top five likely diagnoses without reasoning. I can include major NCD due to Huntington's, psychotic disorder due to medical condition, personality change due to medical condition, and tobacco use disorder. 

For the fifth, I’m weighing between unspecified depressive disorder and unspecified anxiety disorder. Given the depressive features, I lean toward unspecified depressive disorder using the F32.A code, as it aligns well with the symptoms described. 

The final list appears as follows:  
1. Major neurocognitive disorder due to Huntington’s disease, with behavioral disturbance - F02.81  
2. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition (Huntington’s disease) - F06.2  
3. Personality change due to another medical condition (Huntington’s disease) - F07.0  
4. Tobacco use disorder (nicotine dependence, cigarettes) - F17.210  
5. Unspecified depressive disorder - F32.A

**Finalizing diagnoses list**

The user asks for a structured list of top five DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses based on the vignette. I want to ensure that I accurately capture the main conditions related to Huntington's disease. Given the data, major neurocognitive disorder and psychotic disorder due to Huntington's are certainly included. There’s also tobacco use disorder as a possibility. For the fifth diagnosis, I’m leaning toward unspecified anxiety disorder due to noted symptoms.

My final diagnoses list will be:  
1. Major neurocognitive disorder due to Huntington’s disease, with behavioral disturbance - F02.81

5. Unspecified anxiety disorder - F41.9

**Finalizing diagnoses list**

I’m working on crafting the final list of the top five psychiatric diagnoses based on the case details. Major neurocognitive disorder due to Huntington’s disease is definitely at the top, followed by psychotic disorder and personality change due to the same condition. Tobacco use disorder is also relevant, and for the fifth spot, I’m choosing unspecified anxiety disorder since it aligns with the patient’s symptoms. 

Here’s the final list:  
1. Major neurocognitive disorder due to Huntington’s disease, with behavioral disturbance - F02.81  
2. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition (Huntington’s disease) - F06.2

169,"Only upon the repeated and fervent insistence of her parents did 19-year-old Emily reluctantly agree to see a psychiatrist. “It’s not me you want to see,” Emily proclaimed emphatically. “It’s my insane parents who need your help.” Emily did not offer a chief complaint, aside from the concern that her parents were driving her “crazy.” She added, “Everything is going great in my life. I have plenty of friends, go out almost every night, and always have lots of fun.”

While Emily was taking some time away from “the so-called real world,” her sister was attending Duke University, her younger brother was excelling at a competitive private high school, and both her parents seemed to enjoy their careers as radiologists. She asked, “Don’t you think that’s enough strivers for one family?”

Emily agreed to have her parents join the session, and they told a different story. They tearfully disclosed that their daughter had become irritable, unproductive, and oppositional. She drank to intoxication almost every night, often not returning home for an entire weekend. In searching her room, they had found small amounts of marijuana, alprazolam (Xanax), cocaine, and prescription stimulants. The parents described the changes in Emily’s personality as “an adolescent nightmare” and described her friends as “losers who do nothing but dye their hair, get tattoos, and hate everything.” Emily’s attitudes and behavior contrasted markedly with those of her parents and siblings. “We don’t mind that she is doing her own thing and that she isn’t conservative like the rest of us,” her father said, “but it’s like we don’t even recognize who she’s become.”

According to her parents, Emily’s “adolescent nightmare” began 4 years earlier. She had apparently been a studious 15-year-old girl with a lively sense of humor and a wide circle of “terrific friends.” “Almost overnight,” she began to shun her longtime friends in favor of “dropouts and malcontents” and began to accumulate traffic tickets and school detentions. Instead of her former bright-eyed curiosity, Emily manifested a lack of interest in all her academic subjects, and her grades dropped from As to Ds. The parents were at an absolute loss to explain the sudden and dramatic change.

The abrupt change in performance led the psychiatrist to ask Emily to take a battery of neuropsychological tests so the results could be compared with those of tests that she had taken when she had applied to a private high school several years earlier. In particular, Emily retook two high school admissions tests: the System for Assessment and Group Evaluation (SAGE), which measures a broad array of academic and perceptual aptitudes, and the Differential Aptitude Tests (DAT), which focus on reasoning, spelling, and perceptual skills.

On the SAGE, her average percentile scores dropped from the upper 10% for a 13-year-old to the bottom 10% for an adult (and the bottom 20% for a 13-year-old). When Emily took the DAT at age 13, she scored in the highest range for ninth graders across almost all measures. Her worst result had been in spelling, where she scored at the second-highest level. Upon repeating the test at age 19, she scored below the high school average in all measures.

EEG, brain CT, and T2-weighted brain MRI scans showed no evidence of structural brain damage. However, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) T2-weighted MRI displayed a clear lesion in the left frontal cortex, highly suggestive of previous injury to that region.

Upon further questioning about the crucial period in which she seemed to have changed, Emily admitted to being in a traffic accident with her now ex-boyfriend, Mark. Although Emily did not recall much from this episode, she remembered that she hit her head and that she had bad headaches for many weeks thereafter. Because Emily was not bleeding and there was no damage to the car, neither Mark nor Emily reported the incident to anyone. With Emily’s permission, the psychiatrist contacted Mark, who was away at college but a willing and excellent historian. He remembered the incident well. “Emily hit her head very, very hard on the dashboard of my car. She was not totally unconscious but very dazed. For about 3 hours, she spoke very slowly, complained that her head hurt badly, and was confused. For about 2 hours she didn’t know where she was or what day it was. She also threw up twice. I was really scared, but Emily didn’t want me to worry her parents since they’re so overprotective. And then she broke up with me, and we’ve hardly spoken since.”","1. Mild neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury, with behavioral disturbance
2. Alcohol use disorder",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Evaluating alcohol use criteria**

I need to make sure I'm evaluating the criteria for problematic alcohol use properly. The individual drinks almost every night to the point of intoxication, which leads to family conflicts and possibly not returning home on weekends. However, there’s no mention of tolerance, withdrawal, or attempts to cut down. Still, their poor grades might indicate failure to fulfill obligations. Traffic tickets and risky behaviors are concerning too. So, I can list Alcohol Use Disorder, possibly moderate, though I can't specify the severity without more details.

**Considering substance use disorders**

Given the circumstances, it could at least be classified as unspecified alcohol use disorder. There's also potential for cannabis use disorder since small amounts of marijuana were found, though the frequency is unclear. Other possibilities include sedative/hypnotic/anxiolytic use disorder due to alprazolam and stimulant use disorder, like cocaine. I can focus on the top four likely secondary diagnoses based on evidence, prioritizing alcohol use disorder and including others. But I want to avoid overdiagnosing, so I'll consider differential diagnoses as well.

**Exploring possible diagnoses**

I need to consider probable substance use disorders given the substances found and her behavioral issues. However, could it also be bipolar disorder? She's been going out a lot, showing irritability and oppositional behavior, but this began after an accident, with cognitive decline evident in neuropsych tests suggesting brain injury. Frontotemporal disorder seems unlikely at age 15. Perhaps ADHD, but her previous studious behavior conflicts. ""Personality change due to another medical condition"" could also fit, reflecting her disinhibition and irritability.

**Considering dual diagnoses**

I can potentially diagnose ""Personality change due to another medical condition, disinhibited type,"" along with ""Mild/major neurocognitive disorder due to TBI."" However, I need to define the primary diagnosis. It seems that Major neurocognitive disorder due to TBI fits best, considering her significant cognitive decline and behavioral disturbances. I need to ensure criteria are met: major decline in cognitive domains, independence interference, not solely caused by delirium or another mental disorder. Given her academic decline, her independence may be compromised.

**Analyzing potential diagnoses**

I’m looking into possible diagnoses for a case involving significant cognitive decline and behavioral changes. Major neurocognitive disorder due to TBI seems to be the primary diagnosis, while personality changes could also fit. However, I have to stick to F-codes, which complicates things since mild NCD uses G-codes. The situation involves severe cognitive deficits, and personality changes, influenced by TBI. I need to focus on the top five diagnoses, ensuring they align with criteria while being accurate and comprehensive.

**Detailing potential diagnoses**

I’m considering the likely diagnoses for this situation. Major neurocognitive disorder due to TBI seems to be the primary candidate, along with alcohol and cannabis use disorders. There's also a possibility of stimulant and sedative/hypnotic use disorders. While we have limited evidence for the substances aside from possession, they could indicate use. I need to select the top five probable diagnoses, keeping in mind the criteria and codes required, like F10.20 for alcohol use disorder. Balancing accuracy and evidence is essential here.

**Assessing substance use disorders**

I'm considering the likelihood of various diagnoses, including stimulant and sedative use disorders, alongside cognitive and personality changes. Major neurocognitive disorder due to TBI seems like a strong primary option, supported by evidence of cognitive decline and behavioral issues related to substance use. While I want to include multiple substance use disorders, it's tricky since we only have limited evidence, such as possession. I think including ""Other (or unknown) substance use disorder"" could be reasonable to cover potential substance use without overcomplicating things. Ultimately, I'm focusing on justifying the diagnoses I'm listing.

**Determining diagnoses**

I'm assessing a case with significant behavioral and cognitive changes following TBI. The primary diagnosis appears to be ""Major Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Traumatic Brain Injury"" (F02.81) due to evident behavioral disturbances. For secondary diagnoses, I’m considering ""Alcohol use disorder"" (F10.20), ""Cannabis use disorder"" (F12.10), and ""Stimulant use disorder, cocaine type"" (F14.10). While I can also include sedative use disorder, I need to focus on the top five. Balancing multiple substance use disorders is tricky, but it seems likely given her history.

**Clarifying diagnoses**

I'm reviewing diagnosis options for a case involving cognitive decline and substance use. The primary diagnosis seems to be ""Major Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Traumatic Brain Injury"" (F02.81) with behavioral disturbance. I consider secondary diagnoses like ""Alcohol use disorder"" (F10.20), ""Cannabis use disorder"" (F12.10), and ""Cocaine use disorder"" (F14.10). The challenge is picking the top four while ensuring the codes align correctly. We need to justify our choices with evidence of substance use and behavioral changes, so I'll be careful to back up my decisions based on the known facts.

**Deciding on diagnoses**

I'm working through potential diagnoses for a case involving a major neurocognitive disorder (NCD) due to traumatic brain injury (TBI). I'll use the code F02.81 for this primary diagnosis. For secondary diagnoses, I need to choose carefully among substance use disorders like alcohol, cannabis, and cocaine, plus possibly other stimulants or sedatives. I must balance these choices to ensure they reflect the patient's situation accurately, considering the behaviors and symptoms that emerged following the injury, without overlapping codes unnecessarily.

**Choosing diagnoses carefully**

I'm considering whether to include personality change due to TBI along with major neurocognitive disorder (NCD). Symptoms like irritability and disinhibition might fall under both, but including them separately might not align with DSM-5 guidance. I’ll focus on the behaviors that support the primary diagnosis of major NCD while listing secondary diagnoses like alcohol and cannabis use disorders, as well as others. My final output will consist of the most likely conditions, ensuring they're F-coded and relevant to the case at hand.

**Selecting appropriate diagnoses**

I need to choose between stimulant use disorder options, specifically cocaine or other stimulants. DSM-5 requires specificity, so I can’t use a general category. Since cocaine is explicitly found, I’ll select ""Cocaine use disorder."" However, I could also include ""Other stimulant use disorder"" for prescription stimulants. My priority is to keep five diagnoses, focusing on major NCD due to TBI, personality changes, and relevant substance use disorders. Including personality change might add clarity, as it’s a defined DSM diagnosis, so it will be part of my final list.

**Deciding on diagnoses**

It looks like I need to choose the ""disinhibited"" type for personality change, but there are criteria to meet. The personality change must represent a shift from previous patterns, which it does, given the individual now shows irritability and substance use. However, since there's already a diagnosis of NCD due to TBI, I need to be careful about how I list the diagnoses. To make sure I have five diagnoses, I’ll prioritize major NCD with behavioral disturbance and then consider substance use disorders that align closely with her history and context.

**Evaluating substance use disorders**

I think I might include ""Other (or unknown) substance use disorder"" (F19.10) since there's evidence of multiple substances. We also want to list ""Alcohol use disorder"" (F10.20) and consider other diagnoses like ""Personality change due to another medical condition"" (F07.0). I'm debating between ""Other stimulant use disorder"" or ""Cannabis use disorder."" It seems evident that we need to gather the top five most likely diagnoses, even if some are just potential differentials based on the evidence. Let's ensure we focus on what's most supported while keeping it concise!

**Finalizing diagnoses**

The case points to a traffic accident with a concussion leading to personality and cognitive changes, which means the primary diagnosis will be a neurocognitive disorder due to TBI. For the secondary diagnoses, I might consider including substance use disorders, but it's also important to note their comorbidity. The top five likely diagnoses need to be clear. I’ll verify the relevant ICD-10 codes and ensure these encapsulate the diagnosis effectively, focusing on what's most representative of her clinical situation. Let's finalize this list!

**Evaluating diagnoses**

In this case, I should focus on the neurocognitive disorder related to TBI, noting personality and behavioral changes. I can include alcohol use disorder and polysubstance use as secondary diagnoses. However, I'm unsure how to categorize the substance use disorders clearly since specific detail is lacking. While I sense she’s likely to have these disorders, I must consider the evidence. Ultimately, I’m aiming for a structured list of the top five likely diagnoses, factoring in all aspects accurately. Let’s finalize this!

**Finalizing secondary diagnoses**

I’m considering combining cannabis and other substances into an ""Other (or unknown) substance use disorder,"" but that feels a bit off. It might be clearer to treat the primary diagnosis as a neurocognitive disorder from TBI and include secondary diagnoses like alcohol use disorder. While I want to capture all the behaviors, I have to choose the four secondary diagnoses wisely. 

It seems best to include alcohol, stimulant, and sedative use disorders. I still need to decide which one to omit for a final, clear list.

**Selecting final diagnoses**

I'm weighing my options for the psychiatric diagnoses list. I could list “Other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder,"" but I want to ensure I'm following the DSM-5 properly. Since this is a top five list, I think it makes sense to keep it straightforward and prioritize the most relevant disorders.

I’m inclined to include major neurocognitive disorder, alcohol use disorder, cannabis use disorder, and one stimulant disorder. However, I need to decide if I want to go with cocaine use disorder or ""Other stimulant use disorder"" to best reflect the case.

**Refining diagnosis selections**

I'm contemplating my diagnosis choices, particularly whether to include cocaine or prescription stimulants. Given her behavior, cocaine seems more likely since she may use it for partying rather than studying. I’m thinking of finalizing the first four diagnoses as alcohol use disorder, cannabis use disorder, cocaine use disorder, and possibly a sedative disorder. 

The personality change could be part of the major neurocognitive disorder, so it might be best to focus on substance use disorders for the final list. After reviewing everything, I’ll settle on these options.

**Clarifying neurocognitive diagnoses**

I'm trying to confirm the right diagnoses and their codes for neurocognitive disorders. I’m considering options like major neurocognitive disorder due to TBI, which uses the F02.81 code. I need to focus on substance use disorders as secondary diagnoses and carefully select four from the findings. 

I think listing alcohol use disorder with cocaine and possibly sedative use makes sense. Still, I must decide whether to include cannabis or avoid other stimulants based on misusing evidence. I should finalize the list with certainty soon.

**Finalizing psychiatric diagnoses**

I'm working on creating a structured list of psychiatric diagnoses. I plan to include ""Major neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury with behavioral disturbance,"" which uses the code F02.81. Alcohol use disorder is another clear choice, with the code F10.20. For additional diagnoses, I'll consider using cannabis, cocaine, and sedative use disorders, with codes F12.10, F14.10, and F13.10, respectively, even if there's some uncertainty.

I'll make sure to keep it concise and clear, listing exactly five diagnoses with their corresponding codes.","1. Major neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury, with behavioral disturbance - F02.81

170,"Frazier Archer was a 34-year-old single white man who called a mood and personality disorders research program because an ex-friend had once said he was “borderline,” and Mr. Archer wanted to learn more about his personality.

During his diagnostic research interview, Mr. Archer was initially reluctant to share personal information, citing a concern that his words would be misunderstood, misconstrued, or used against him. When asked about his relationships, he described regular, almost daily situations in which he was sure he was being lied to or deceived. He was particularly wary of people in leadership positions and people who had studied psychology and, therefore, had “training to understand the human mind,” which they used to manipulate people. Unlike those around him, Mr. Archer believed he did not “drink the Kool-Aid” and was able to detect manipulation and deceit.

Mr. Archer was employed as an assistant manager for a grocery store chain. He was extremely detail oriented at work, and had trouble delegating and completing tasks. He noted that his coworkers consistently failed to complete tasks the way that he would like. This led him to work routinely long hours “fixing their mistakes.” Numerous employers and colleagues had told him that he focused excessively on rules, lists, and small details, and that he needed to be more friendly. He described having held numerous jobs over the years, but he was quick to add, “I’ve quit as often as I’ve been fired.”

During the interview, he emphasized that unlike many people, he understood the value of quality over productivity. He believed that his “high standards” had contributed to his “bad temper” and emotional “ups and downs.” He socialized only “superficially” with a handful of acquaintances and could recall the exact moments when previous “so-called friends and lovers” had betrayed him. He spent most of his time alone.

Mr. Archer denied any significant history of trauma, any current or past problems with substance use, and any history of head trauma or loss of consciousness. He also denied any history of mental health diagnosis or treatment, but he did feel he might have a mental health condition that had not yet been diagnosed. He described some social anxiety and difficulties with academic achievement in childhood, which he attributed to his own high standards and “unreliable” childhood friends.

On mental status examination, Mr. Archer appeared well groomed, cooperative, and oriented. His speech varied; at times he would pause thoughtfully prior to answering questions and provide very slow, deliberate responses. At other points in the interview he became angry and offered lengthy and digressive responses. However, he seemed generally coherent and did not evidence any perceptual disturbances. His affect was occasionally inappropriate (e.g., smiling while crying) and generally constricted. He reported apathy as to whether he lived or died but did not report any active suicidal ideation or homicidal ideation.

Notably, Mr. Archer became irritated and argumentative with research staff when he was told that although he could receive verbal feedback on his interviews, he could not receive a copy of the completed questionnaires and diagnostic tools. He commented that he would document in his personal records that research staff were refusing him the forms.","1. Paranoid personality disorder
2. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Clarifying psychiatric codes**

I'm considering the usage of ICD-10-CM codes for depression. F32.A is for unspecified depression since 2022, but we're typically using ICD-10 F-codes. I'm wondering if F32.A is valid or too new. For safety, I might stick with F32.9 for major depressive disorder, but that's not quite the same. Alternatively, I think about including F60.89 for other specified personality disorders, mixed features. Ultimately, I'll have to focus on providing a list without delving into reasoning.

**Analyzing personality cues**

I'm carefully examining the vignette to pick up on subtle cues and patterns for the top five traits. The person in question called a mood and personality disorders program because an ex-friend called him ""borderline,"" showing a desire to understand himself. Initially, he was reluctant to share personal information due to fears of being misunderstood or manipulated. He feels suspicious in relationships and believes he detects manipulation. At work as an assistant manager, he’s overly detail-oriented, has trouble delegating, and struggles with coworkers not meeting his expectations.

**Understanding interpersonal challenges**

The individual has held numerous jobs, indicating interpersonal difficulties and a conflict-driven nature. They noted a pattern of quitting as often as being fired, suggesting rigidity and high standards. They value quality over productivity, which they believe leads to a bad temper and emotional fluctuations. Social interactions are superficial, recalling betrayals from past friends and lovers while spending most time alone. Although they denied past trauma or mental health treatment, they suspect an undiagnosed condition, describing some social anxiety linked to their high standards and unreliable friendships. During the mental status exam, they appeared well-groomed but showed varying speech patterns and occasionally inappropriate affect.

**Evaluating psychological features**

The individual reports feeling apathetic about life but doesn't express any active suicidal or homicidal thoughts. However, they became irritated when denied copies of questionnaires, showing suspicion and a controlling attitude. Key features seem to include suspiciousness, perfectionism, social isolation, and emotional lability. I’m considering potential diagnoses like Paranoid Personality Disorder, Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder, or even traits of Autism Spectrum Disorder due to social difficulties and rigidity. Though they may misinterpret social cues, their strong suspicions and grudges complicate the picture.

**Exploring potential diagnoses**

I'm dissecting the possible diagnoses here. We've got maybe ""Delusional Disorder, persecutory type"" or other psychotic disorders, but the individual is coherent and functioning. They show overvalued ideas about manipulation, which could point to Paranoid Personality Disorder. Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder is a consideration, given their detail-oriented nature, but there are no reported obsessions or compulsions. They have some social anxiety, possibly leading to ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder."" Cyclothymic disorder is less likely without a clear timeline. The top five might include Paranoid Personality Disorder, Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, borderline traits, and unspecified depressive disorder. I need to ensure the list follows DSM-5-TR and ICD-10 standards. But I feel unsure about how the symptoms align sufficiently for some of these diagnoses.

**Choosing potential diagnoses**

I'm considering various diagnoses based on social anxiety and other symptoms. Options include ""Social Anxiety Disorder"" or ""Unspecified Depressive Disorder."" I need to ensure we have sufficient evidence for the top five diagnoses, as requested. I feel like ""Paranoid Personality Disorder"" and ""Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder"" are likely candidates. Considering everything, I might also include ""Borderline Personality Disorder"" but need to avoid ""provisional"" labels. It's tricky since we must adhere strictly to the available information and support for each diagnosis. Let's structure this with five solid entries.

**Evaluating potential diagnoses**

The user seems to have a complex set of traits and symptoms. There's a possibility of ""Paranoid Personality Disorder"" due to suspicion about manipulation. Traits also suggest ""Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder"" due to high standards and perfectionism. I’m weighing options like ""Narcissistic Personality Disorder"" for his grandiosity. While ""Borderline Personality Disorder"" has some validity, I wonder if the criteria are fully met. I need to rank these diagnoses while sticking closely to the provided evidence and avoiding assumptions. It's a nuanced consideration!

**Identifying possible diagnoses**

I’m considering potential features of narcissistic personality disorder related to grandiosity, but it doesn’t match entirely. Schizoid personality disorder seems less likely since he has had romantic relationships. Borderline traits might fit, but I wonder about the mix of features. I'd consider ""Other specified personality disorder"" to capture the complexities. I need to list five possible diagnoses while ensuring the ICD-10 codes are correct. The challenge lies in making decisions while adhering to the guidelines and presenting a structured approach!

**Evaluating personality disorders**

I'm considering different personality disorders, starting with the possibility of schizotypal personality disorder. His features include suspiciousness, odd beliefs, and social anxiety, which could fit. However, distinguishing between paranoia and odd beliefs is tricky. I also need to determine if including three personality disorders is appropriate, as DSM allows multiple diagnoses. For the final list, I'm settling on paranoid personality disorder, obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, and possibly a mixed personality disorder, along with social anxiety. It feels like navigating a complex maze of criteria!

**Finalizing diagnoses**

I'm weighing various diagnostic options. I think specifying ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" may help avoid misdiagnosing borderline or schizotypal disorders. His features indicate he likely meets criteria for paranoid personality disorder (PPD) and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD). I also need to choose secondary diagnoses wisely. Social anxiety disorder seems plausible, and I’m considering unspecified depressive disorder as well. For the fifth slot, I'm debating between schizotypal and borderline personality disorder, but I need to justify whatever I include based on evidence. It's a careful balancing act!

**Determining final diagnoses**

I'm refining diagnostic options here, considering ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" or ""Unspecified bipolar disorder."" Given the strong evidence for paranoid and obsessive-compulsive personality disorders, I lean toward those. However, I need to select five possible diagnoses, weighing their plausibility. The standout options include paranoid personality disorder, obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, and a few others based on his traits. I need to finalize this sensitive matter carefully, ensuring all choices are well-supported by the information available. It feels a bit like balancing on a tightrope!

**Ranking potential diagnoses**

I’m considering whether to include borderline personality disorder as a differential diagnosis. My top five likely diagnoses are: Paranoid personality disorder, Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, Schizotypal personality disorder, Social anxiety disorder, and Borderline personality disorder. I need to rank these based on the evidence provided. Social anxiety appears less likely since there's no fear of negative evaluation, while paranoid features are more central. I’m finalizing the ICD-10 codes as they apply to these diagnoses, ensuring they align with the DSM-5-TR formatting, and deciding if delusional disorder might fit in last place as a possibility.

**Finalizing psychiatric diagnoses**

It seems the individual shows more general suspicion than specific delusions, which makes delusional disorder less fitting. They might actually have obsessive-compulsive personality disorder instead. They've reported apathy and passive suicidal feelings, which could signal major depressive disorder, but I might lean towards unspecified depressive disorder as a fifth option instead of borderline personality disorder. The final list I’m considering includes diagnoses based on their personality features, ensuring they match the criteria accurately for a complete assessment.

**Deciding on diagnoses**

It looks like we need to finalize the diagnoses to fit the provided criteria. I’m considering ""Schizotypal personality disorder,"" given the signs of inappropriate affect and odd speech. Still, I'm leaning towards ""Paranoid personality disorder"" as primary due to the clear themes of suspicion. For the third diagnosis, ""Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder"" seems appropriate. I might also consider ""Social anxiety disorder"" for fourth, and possibly ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" for the fifth. I will present my findings in a structured format as requested.

**Finalizing diagnoses**

It seems I need to finalize the list of diagnoses. I’m considering including ""Borderline personality disorder"" as the fifth option over ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" because borderline aligns with his passive death wish and emotional lability. However, I still question whether he meets the criteria for that diagnosis. Instead, I might choose ""Other specified personality disorder"" as a more ethical option. Reviewing his affect and symptoms, I lean towards ""Schizotypal personality disorder"" due to the odd speech and behavior. I’ll finalize my list of five diagnoses according to the correct ICD codes.

**Finalizing the ICD code**

I’m trying to determine which ICD code is more widely recognized. F32.9 is commonly used, but the DSM-5-TR indicates that ""Unspecified depressive disorder"" is actually coded as F32.A. Some people might not accept alphanumeric codes, but since I’m aligning with the DSM-5-TR, I’ll go with F32.A. I just need to confirm that there are no extra spaces or punctuation before delivering the final outputs.","1. Paranoid personality disorder - F60.0

171,"Grzegorz Buchalski was an 87-year-old white man who was brought to the psychiatric emergency room (ER) by paramedics after they had been called to his apartment by neighbors when they noticed an odd smell. Apparently, his 90-year-old sister had died some days earlier after a lengthy illness. Mr. Buchalski had delayed reporting her death for several reasons. He had become increasingly disorganized as his sister’s health had worsened, and he was worried that his landlord would use the apartment’s condition as a pretext for eviction. He had tried to clean up, but his attempts consisted mainly of moving items from one place to another. He said he was about to call for help when the police and paramedics showed up.

In the ER, Mr. Buchalski recognized that his actions were odd and that he should have called for help sooner. At times, he became tearful when discussing the situation and his sister’s death; at other times, he seemed aloof, speaking about these in a calm, factual way. He also wanted to clarify that his apartment had indeed been a mess but that much of the apparent mess was actually his large collection of articles on bioluminescence, a topic he had been researching for decades.

A licensed plumber, electrician, and locksmith, Mr. Buchalski had worked until age 65. He described his late sister as having been always “a little strange.” She had never worked and had been married once, briefly. Aside from the several-month marriage, she and Mr. Buchalski had lived in the family’s two-bedroom Manhattan apartment their entire lives. Neither of them had ever seen a psychiatrist.

When questioned, Mr. Buchalski stated that he had never had a romantic or sexual relationship and had never had many friends or social contacts outside his family. He explained that he had been poor and Polish and had had to work all the time. He had taken night classes to better understand “the strange world we live in,” and he said his intellectual interests were what he found most gratifying. He said he had been upset as he realized that his sister was dying, but he would call it “numb” rather than depressed. He also denied any history of manic or psychotic symptoms. After an hour with the psychiatric trainee, Mr. Buchalski confided that he hoped the medical school might be interested in some of his papers after his death. He said he believed that bioluminescent and genetic technologies were on the verge of a breakthrough that might allow the skin of animals and then humans to glow in subtle colors that would allow people to more directly recognize emotions. He had written the notes for such technology, but they had grown into a “way-too-long science fiction novel with lots of footnotes.”

On examination, Mr. Buchalski was a thin, elderly man dressed neatly in khakis and button-down shirt. He was meticulous and much preferred to discuss his interests in science than his own story. He made appropriate eye contact and had a polite, pleasant demeanor. His speech was coherent and goal directed. His mood was “fine,” and his affect was appropriate though perhaps unusually cheerful under the circumstances. He denied all symptoms of psychosis, depression, and mania. Aside from his comments about bioluminescence, he said nothing that sounded delusional. He was cognitively intact, and his insight and judgment were considered generally good, although historically impaired in regard to his delay in calling the police about his sister.",Schizoid personality disorder,dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Finalizing diagnoses list**

I’m focusing on the top five diagnoses and their codes. Should I add ""Unspecified personality disorder""? We already have other options. The list includes Schizoid Personality Disorder (F60.1), Hoarding Disorder (F42.3), Autism Spectrum Disorder (F84.0), Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (F60.5), and Adjustment Disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct (F43.25). I’m considering if hoarding is more prevalent than autism, but we must rank them based on the best-supported evidence regarding symptoms and impairments.

**Evaluating diagnoses**

I’m evaluating the possibilities for diagnosis here. The individual doesn’t show distress when discarding items, and although there’s a concern about eviction, that might not indicate hoarding. However, his behavior—like moving things without throwing out—suggests a possible difficulty discarding. We usually see clutter with hoarding, but he’s neat. It’s confusing. I need to consider other diagnoses, like obsessive-compulsive disorder or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum. However, he denies psychosis and delusions, so that might not fit either.

**Finalizing diagnoses list**

I’m reviewing the diagnostic codes to ensure they align with the user’s request for ICD-10 F-codes. Mild neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's uses G codes, while major neurocognitive disorder utilizes F codes like F02.80. Since I can’t include non-psychiatric diagnoses, and the individual appears cognitively intact, those options are out. I need to prioritize the main diagnosis and four secondary ones that fit the F code requirement. I’m ready to create a numbered list of the top five diagnoses with their specific codes.

**Constructing the final diagnoses list**

I'm organizing the top diagnoses, ensuring to distinguish between the primary and secondary ones. For clarity, I won’t add ""Autism Spectrum Disorder - F84.0"" as a secondary diagnosis if it doesn’t fit. My list currently includes Schizoid Personality Disorder, Hoarding Disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder, and Adjustment Disorder. I need to double-check the ICD-10 codes, especially for Hoarding Disorder, and reconsider if Autism Spectrum Disorder might be the more suitable primary diagnosis for an 87-year-old with those social challenges.

**Determining primary diagnosis**

I'm navigating through the evidence for the best diagnosis. The DSM requires early signs for autism, but this person's history suggests lifelong social difficulties and intense interests, like bioluminescence. I’m considering if he might be high-functioning autistic due to his meticulous nature and lack of romantic relationships. Although he maintains appropriate eye contact and is polite, his focused interests might indicate deficits in social-emotional reciprocity. Schizoid personality disorder also fits, but it seems less likely. 

In the end, ASD appears to be the most plausible, especially given his fascination with emotional recognition.

**Evaluating potential diagnoses**

I'm considering if ""Adjustment Disorder"" fits due to the stress of the sister's illness, but I'm unsure if his emotional response alone meets psychiatric diagnostic criteria. There’s no clear acute disorder; instead, he seems to exhibit longstanding personality traits like schizoid tendencies and possibly hoarding behavior. I’m pondering over the diagnoses and will compile a final list. I think Autism Spectrum Disorder might be a primary diagnosis due to his unique interests and social difficulties, though schizoid personality also fits well.  

Ultimately, I’ll finalize my top five diagnoses, balancing evidence from the case and DSM guidelines.

**Determining diagnoses for the case**

I'm analyzing the case where he shows meticulous behavior and a preference for discussing scientific interests. ASD and schizoid personality disorders both fit, but I’m trying to figure out which is more likely. Autism involves social communication deficits and restricted interests, while schizoid is characterized by emotional detachment. He seems intellectually engaged and aware of his circumstances, which complicates the diagnosis. Hoarding disorder might also be primary due to the disorganization and collection of articles.

I’m considering multiple disorders, like “Other Specified Personality Disorder” for his characteristics that don’t fully match any one diagnosis, and how his situation with his sister’s death impacts his behavior.

**Analyzing potential diagnoses**

I’m looking at a case that might relate to autism in later life. This elderly man could have been misdiagnosed with schizoid personality disorder when he may actually have Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). His keen interest in science and emotional recognition tools indicates possible ASD traits. He also leads a socially isolated life and has difficulty with relationship-building, which seems consistent with ASD. The challenge is identifying which traits fit the criteria, especially since the DSM requires persistent deficits. I've suggested a list of top potential diagnoses, leaning more towards ASD.

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

It seems the evidence is leaning towards a primary diagnosis of schizoid personality disorder, supported by criteria like little interest in sex, lack of friends, preference for solitary activities, and possibly emotional detachment. While his hoarding could be noted, it's uncertain if it directly fits into his diagnosis. Therefore, I will finalize the primary diagnosis as schizoid personality disorder and potentially include hoarding as a secondary diagnosis. Now, I need to structure my final response accordingly without any reasoning.","1. Schizoid Personality Disorder - F60.1

172,"Henry, a 19-year-old college sophomore, was referred to the student health center by a teaching assistant who noticed that he appeared odd, worried, and preoccupied and that his lab notebook was filled with bizarrely threatening drawings.

Henry appeared on time for the psychiatric consultation. Although suspicious about the reason for the referral, he explained that he generally “followed orders” and would do what he was asked. He agreed that he had been suspicious of some of his classmates, believing they were undermining his abilities. He said they were telling his instructors that he was “a weird guy” and that they did not want him as a lab partner. The referral to the psychiatrist was, he said, confirmation of his perception.

Henry described how he had seen two students “flip a coin” over whether he was gay or straight. Coins, he asserted, could often predict the future. He had once flipped a coin and “heads” had predicted his mother’s illness. He believed his thoughts often came true.

Henry had transferred to this out-of-town university after an initial year at his local community college. The transfer was his parents’ idea, he said, and was part of their agenda to get him to be like everyone else and go to parties and hang out with girls. He said all such behavior was a waste of time. Although they had tried to push him into moving into the dorms, he had refused, and instead lived by himself in an off-campus apartment.

With Henry’s permission, his mother was called for collateral information. She said Henry had been quiet, shy, and reserved since childhood. He had never had close friends, had never dated, and had denied wanting to have friends. He acknowledged feeling depressed and anxious at times, but these feelings did not improve when he was around other people. He was teased by other kids and would come home upset. His mother cried while explaining that she always felt bad for him because he never really “fit in,” and that she and her husband had tried to coach him for years without success. She wondered how a person could function without any social life.

She added that ghosts, telepathy, and witchcraft had fascinated Henry since junior high school. He had long thought that he could change the outcome of events like earthquakes and hurricanes by thinking about them. He had consistently denied any substance use disorder, and two drug screens had been negative in the prior 2 years. She mentioned that her grandfather had died in an “insane asylum” many years before Henry was born, but she did not know his diagnosis.

On examination, Henry was tall, thin, and dressed in jeans and a T-shirt. He was alert and wary and, although nonspontaneous, he answered questions directly. He denied feeling depressed or confused. Henry denied any history of suicidal thoughts, plans, or attempts. He denied having any auditory or visual hallucinations, panic attacks, obsessions, compulsions, or phobias. His intellectual skills seemed above average, and his Mini-Mental State Examination score was 30 out of 30.","1. Schizotypal personality disorder
2. Paranoid personality disorder",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Considering diagnoses**

I need to limit my diagnoses to five and focus on the most plausible ones using F-codes. I’ll take a look at the DSM-5-TR for Schizotypal Personality Disorder, which is coded as 301.22. For the ICD-10-CM, it corresponds to code F21. This disorder falls under cluster A, which is interesting because it often relates to odd or eccentric behaviors. I’ll keep that in mind as I compile the list.

**Analyzing diagnostic criteria**

I’m looking at the criteria for identifying a pervasive pattern of social and interpersonal deficits related to Schizotypal Personality Disorder. It highlights acute discomfort with close relationships, cognitive distortions, and eccentric behaviors. The diagnosis requires five or more specific features, like ideas of reference, odd beliefs, unusual perceptual experiences, and suspiciousness. There’s also mention of social anxiety linked to paranoid fears. I’ll keep these criteria detailed as I consider how to use them effectively.

**Evaluating potential diagnoses**

I'm assessing various diagnoses that seem relevant here. He shows signs of ideas of reference, odd beliefs, suspiciousness, and a lack of friends, alongside social anxiety. Moving on to Paranoid Personality Disorder, it requires four indicators like suspicion of others or reading hidden meanings, which he displays with his classmates and parents. However, I feel there's not enough evidence for a definitive diagnosis. Regarding delusional disorder, we can't confirm the duration of any potential delusions. Lastly, for Autism Spectrum Disorder, he might not exhibit enough restricted/repetitive behaviors.

**Assessing social anxiety and alternatives**

I’m considering social anxiety disorder but feel there's not enough evidence to diagnose it. He’s definitely shy, and although social anxiety is part of schizotypal criteria, we could list it as secondary. He denies any phobias, which confuses things since social anxiety is often viewed as a type of phobia. He admits to feeling anxious at times but denies panic attacks. I think it’s better to explore personality disorder alternatives like schizoid and avoidant. I’ll work on creating that top 5 list.

**Formulating potential diagnoses**

I’m considering a range of possible diagnoses, starting with Schizotypal Personality Disorder (F21). Autism Spectrum Disorder (F84.0) might fit, but I need to determine if it's the best option. Paranoid Personality Disorder (F60.0) could be a contender because of the expressed suspicion. While I see signs of social deficits, Schizoid Personality Disorder (F60.1) is also on the list due to social detachment. Delusional Disorder (F22) is possible, but I need to ensure these align with the criteria before finalizing a top five list.

**Finalizing potential diagnoses**

I’m sorting through potential diagnoses like Schizotypal Personality Disorder (F21) because it fits well. Next, I’ll consider Autism Spectrum Disorder (F84.0) and Paranoid Personality Disorder (F60.0), given the suspicions noted. Schizoid Personality Disorder (F60.1) could apply, but he shows signs of magical thinking that lean towards Schizotypal. Delusional Disorder (F22) seems less likely, especially if he denies hallucinations. I’ll solidify my top five with these considerations in mind. Here's the likely list: 

1. Schizotypal Personality Disorder - F21
2. Autism Spectrum Disorder - F84.0
3. Paranoid Personality Disorder - F60.0
4. Schizoid Personality Disorder - F60.1
5. Delusional Disorder - F22

**Compiling diagnostic list**

I need to provide a structured list of the top five most likely diagnoses along with their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes. Based on the clinical information, I’ll include Schizotypal Personality Disorder (F21), Paranoid Personality Disorder (F60.0), Autism Spectrum Disorder (F84.0), Delusional Disorder (F22), and Schizoid Personality Disorder (F60.1). Since I’m focusing strictly on these listed conditions without any additional commentary or reasoning, it’s important to ensure they align with DSM-5 criteria while adhering to the F-codes. Here’s the final list:

1. Schizotypal Personality Disorder - F21

173,"Ike Crocker was a 32-year-old white divorced carpenter referred for a mental health evaluation by the human resources department of a large construction business that had been his employer for 2 weeks. At his initial job interview, Mr. Crocker presented as very motivated and provided two carpentry school certifications that indicated a high level of skill and training. Since his employment began, his supervisors had noted frequent arguments, absenteeism, poor workmanship, and multiple errors that might have been dangerous. When confronted, he was reportedly dismissive, indicating that the problem was “cheap wood” and “bad management” and added that if someone got hurt, “it’s because of their own stupidity.”

When the head of human resources met with him to discuss termination, Mr. Crocker quickly pointed out that he had both attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and bipolar disorder. He said that if not granted an accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act, he would sue. He demanded a psychiatric evaluation.

During the mental health evaluation, Mr. Crocker focused on unfairness at the company and on how he was “a hell of a better carpenter than anyone there could ever be.” He claimed that his two marriages had ended because of jealousy. He said that his wives were “always thinking I was with other women,” which is why “they both lied to judges and got restraining orders saying I’d hit them.” As “payback for the jail time,” he refused to pay child support for his two children. He had no interest in seeing either of his two boys because they were “little liars” like their mothers.

Mr. Crocker said he “must have been smart” because he had been able to make Cs in school despite showing up only half the time. He spent time in juvenile hall at age 14 for stealing “kid stuff, like tennis shoes and wallets that were practically empty.” He left school at age 15 after being “framed for stealing a car” by his principal. Mr. Crocker pointed out these historical facts as evidence that he was able to overcome injustice and adversity. A review of a juvenile probation officer’s report indicated that beginning in the first grade, he often bullied children with disabilities, was noted to smile when his victims would cry, and consistently lacked remorse or guilt for his actions.

In regard to substance use, Mr. Crocker said he smoked marijuana as a teenager and started drinking alcohol on a “regular basis” after he first got married at age 22. He denied that use of either substance was a problem.

Mr. Crocker concluded the interview by demanding a note from the examiner that he had “bipolar” and “ADHD.” He said that he was “bipolar” because he had “ups and downs” and got “mad real fast.” Mr. Crocker denied other symptoms of mania. He said he got down when disappointed, but he had “a short memory” and “could get out of a funk pretty quick.” Mr. Crocker reported no difficulties in his sleep, mood, or appetite. He learned about ADHD because “both of my boys got it.” He concluded the interview with a request for medications, adding that the only ones that worked were stimulants (“any of them”) and a specific short-acting benzodiazepine.

On mental status examination, Mr. Crocker was a casually dressed man who made reasonable eye contact and was without abnormal movements. His speech was coherent, goal directed, and of normal rate. There was no evidence of any thought disorder or hallucinations. He was preoccupied with blaming others, but these comments appeared to represent overvalued ideas rather than delusions. He was cognitively intact. His insight into his situation was poor.

The head of human resources did a background check during the course of the psychiatric evaluation. Phone calls revealed that Mr. Crocker had been expelled from two carpentry training programs and that both of his graduation certificates had been falsified. He had been fired from his job at one local construction company after a fistfight with his supervisor and from another job after abruptly leaving a job site. A quick review of the company’s records indicated that Mr. Crocker had provided them with the same false documentation.",Antisocial personality disorder,dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Clarifying conduct disorder diagnosis**

I’m looking into conduct disorder, typically diagnosed in childhood or adolescence but can also be identified in adults if criteria are met. The DSM-5 highlights different types, like ""childhood-onset"" and ""adolescent-onset."" However, if an adult meets criteria for Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD), we usually don’t also diagnose conduct disorder, since it's part of their history for ASPD. I see there's also a specifier for ""with limited prosocial emotions,"" which adds another layer of complexity.

**Analyzing potential diagnoses**

The prompt specifies identifying the top 5 likely diagnoses. I’m considering including personality disorders like Antisocial and Narcissistic Personality Disorder. I might see options such as ""Alcohol Use Disorder, mild,"" or ""Cannabis Use Disorder, in sustained remission."" 

Evaluating the vignette, we have a 32-year-old carpenter showing dismissive blame toward coworkers, claiming ADHD and bipolar disorder while demanding accommodations. He focuses on perceived unfairness and has a contentious history with relationships, expressing no interest in his children, too. This paints a complex picture of his behavior and potential diagnoses.

**Identifying behavioral patterns**

I’m observing a clear pattern of irresponsibility and lack of empathy in this individual. In school, he barely put in effort, getting Cs while only attending half the time. He ended up in juvenile hall at 14 for petty theft and left school at 15, claiming he was framed by the principal, which he sees as overcoming injustice.

The juvenile probation report reveals bullying behavior since first grade, showing a troubling lack of remorse. Substance use also appears, with regular marijuana use in his teens followed by alcohol after his first marriage.

**Examining denial and behavioral issues**

I see a strong pattern of denial in this individual. He concludes the interview by insisting on noting his bipolar disorder and ADHD but downplays other symptoms of mania. He mentions experiencing mood swings, but he claims no issues with sleep, mood, or appetite.

His knowledge of ADHD comes from his sons’ diagnoses, and he’s looking for medication, specifically stimulants or benzodiazepines. The mental status exam shows he’s casual and coherent, yet he’s focused on blaming others and exhibits poor insight. A background check reveals troubling patterns, including being expelled from carpentry programs and falsifying graduation certificates, hinting at deceitful behavior.

**Determining potential diagnoses**

I’m evaluating diagnoses for this individual, considering Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) and Narcissistic Personality Disorder as possibilities. Substance use could also be relevant, with alcohol use noted, but the evidence might not be strong enough for a clear diagnosis.

Looking at the DSM-5-TR criteria, ASPD fits well given his history of conduct disorder, deceitfulness, aggression, and lack of remorse. Narcissistic traits also appear, but they overlap with ASPD. I need to rank the top potential diagnoses based on what I’ve found, keeping in mind to root everything in the provided information without inventing criteria.

**Proposing diagnoses with ICD codes**

I’m focusing on creating a list of the top five likely diagnoses along with their ICD-10 F-codes. I'm considering Antisocial Personality Disorder (F60.2) as primary, followed by Narcissistic Personality Disorder (F60.81). Alcohol Use Disorder might be possible, but there's uncertainty, so I’m leaning towards mild (F10.10). Additionally, I can explore Cannabis Use Disorder (in sustained remission, F12.21) and perhaps Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (F90.2). Lastly, I might include ""Conduct Disorder, Childhood-Onset Type"" (F91.1) to acknowledge his historical issues in youth.

**Listing potential diagnoses**

I’m working on compiling five potential diagnoses with their ICD-10 F-codes based on the provided information. The top ones I’m considering include Antisocial Personality Disorder (F60.2) as the primary diagnosis and Narcissistic Personality Disorder (F60.81) as a secondary. I might include Alcohol Use Disorder (F10.10) and Cannabis Use Disorder (in sustained remission, F12.21). Additionally, I’m contemplating adding Conduct Disorder, Childhood-Onset Type (F91.1) to reflect his history. Lastly, I could include Other Specified Personality Disorder (F60.89) to fill the list.

**Choosing diagnoses**

I'm working on identifying the top five diagnoses and their corresponding ICD-10 F-codes. I’m considering Antisocial Personality Disorder (F60.2) as the primary diagnosis and Narcissistic Personality Disorder (F60.81) as a secondary option. For substance use, I’m thinking about Alcohol Use Disorder (F10.10) and Cannabis Use Disorder (F12.21), if the evidence supports these. Finally, I might include Paranoid Personality Disorder (F60.0) or conduct disorder due to his past behavior. I need to ensure all these choices are well-supported by the provided information.

I'm contemplating whether to include ""Conduct Disorder, childhood-onset type"" as a historical diagnosis despite the individual being an adult now. I can list it since it reflects past behavior, even though currently, Antisocial Personality Disorder might apply more accurately. For the top five diagnoses, I’m thinking of:

1. Antisocial Personality Disorder
2. Narcissistic Personality Disorder
3. Conduct Disorder, childhood-onset type (historical)
4. Alcohol Use Disorder (mild)
5. Cannabis Use Disorder (in remission)

I need to ensure I only include diagnoses that are well-supported by evidence without fabricating any details.

I’m examining the criteria for secondary diagnoses, noting that conditions might be less likely but still plausible given the data. Even if ADHD and bipolar disorder are considered, they don’t seem likely based on his denials and claims. I need to list four additional diagnoses. The most plausible ones I’m considering include:

1. Antisocial Personality Disorder
2. Narcissistic Personality Disorder
3. Conduct Disorder, childhood-onset type (historical)
4. Other specified personality disorder (possibly with paranoid traits)

But I must avoid fabricating details and ensure these names align with defined criteria.

I'm considering the potential diagnoses based on his behaviors and history. I'm thinking about including both alcohol and cannabis use disorders because he has a record of regular use, but I’m not entirely sure about their validity. Observing his traits, behaviors like blaming others, poor insight, and past bullying point to complex personality disorders. I’m leaning towards a final list of:

1. Antisocial personality disorder - F60.2
2. Narcissistic personality disorder - F60.81
3. Conduct disorder, childhood-onset type - F91.1
4. Alcohol use disorder - F10.10
5. Paranoid personality disorder - F60.0

I need to ensure these align with the data without fabricating anything.

I'm thinking through diagnoses, particularly regarding substance use and personality disorders. I’m considering including disorders like stimulant and sedative use because of his medication-seeking behavior, but there’s not enough evidence for those. I want to structure my final list with five plausible diagnoses using correct ICD-10 codes:

1. Antisocial personality disorder - F60.2
2. Narcissistic personality disorder - F60.81
3. Conduct disorder, childhood-onset type - F91.1
4. Paranoid personality disorder - F60.0
5. Alcohol use disorder, mild - F10.10

I need to keep it concise without extra reasoning!

I'm weighing various diagnostic options and considering ""Personality disorder, unspecified"" as a fallback. However, if we already have Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD), that diagnosis becomes redundant. I’m brainstorming possible alternatives for a top five list of diagnoses: 

1. Antisocial personality disorder - F60.2  
2. Narcissistic personality disorder - F60.81  
3. Conduct disorder, childhood-onset type - F91.1  
4. Alcohol use disorder, mild - F10.10  
5. Paranoid personality disorder - F60.0  

I need to ensure they reflect the most plausible options without misdiagnosing.

I'm considering various diagnostic options and weighing the pros and cons. While paranoid personality disorder seems less likely, I could think about using ""Other specified personality disorder."" But since we have ASPD and narcissistic traits, this might not be necessary. I need to focus more on substance use disorders and consider:

1. Antisocial personality disorder - F60.2  
2. Narcissistic personality disorder - F60.81  
3. Conduct disorder, childhood-onset type - F91.1  
4. Alcohol use disorder, mild - F10.10  
5. Cannabis use disorder - F12.21  

This could address the presenting issues effectively without over-diagnosing.

I'm trying to finalize the diagnostic list, and it's a bit tricky. They didn't specify for provisional diagnoses, but I think it’s important to indicate uncertainty where needed. 

I’m considering the following possible diagnoses based on the information available:

1. Antisocial personality disorder - F60.2  
2. Narcissistic personality disorder - F60.81  
3. Conduct disorder, childhood-onset type - F91.1  
4. Alcohol use disorder, mild - F10.10  
5. Stimulant use disorder, unspecified - F15.10  

I feel this list captures the most plausible conditions considering the patient's behavior and reported symptoms.

I'm sorting through the diagnoses and it's challenging! I’m considering the best options for the patient's case. 

For the primary diagnosis, I believe ""Antisocial personality disorder"" (F60.2) fits. As for secondaries, I might select ""Narcissistic personality disorder"" (F60.81), ""Conduct disorder, childhood-onset type"" (F91.1), and ""Alcohol use disorder, mild"" (F10.10). 

I’m also debating on ""Cannabis use disorder"" and whether to mark it as unspecified or mild. Finally, I'm leaning toward including ADHD as a possible differential diagnosis based on reported symptoms and family history. This feels like the most plausible list based on available information!

I’m weighing whether to include an ADHD diagnosis since the ICD-10 code F90.2 fits. However, the patient doesn’t clearly show symptoms of inattention or hyperactivity, and there's a possibility he might be malingering by seeking stimulants. 

For a strong final list, I'm considering: 

1. Antisocial personality disorder - F60.2
2. Narcissistic personality disorder - F60.81
3. Conduct disorder, childhood-onset type, with limited prosocial emotions - F91.1
4. Alcohol use disorder, mild - F10.10 
5. Cannabis use disorder, mild - F12.10

I feel these options best align with the patient’s patterns while remaining rooted in the information available!

I'm considering whether the patient meets the criteria for Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) based on traits like grandiosity, entitlement, and a lack of empathy. He shows several characteristics, like believing he is better than others and demanding accommodations, which could suggest NPD is plausible.

For a final list, I'm confident in including the following diagnoses:

1. Antisocial personality disorder - F60.2
2. Narcissistic personality disorder - F60.81
3. Conduct disorder, childhood-onset type, with limited prosocial emotions - F91.1
4. Alcohol use disorder, mild - F10.10
5. Cannabis use disorder, mild - F12.10 

This seems to cover the key points effectively!","1. Antisocial personality disorder - F60.2

174,"Juanita Delgado, a single, unemployed Hispanic woman, sought therapy at age 33 for treatment of depressed mood, chronic suicidal thoughts, social isolation, and poor personal hygiene. She had spent the prior 6 months isolated in her apartment, lying in bed, eating junk food, watching television, and doing more online shopping than she could afford. Multiple treatments had yielded little effect.

Ms. Delgado was the middle of three children in an upper-middle-class immigrant family in which the father reportedly valued professional achievement over all else. She felt isolated throughout her school years and experienced recurrent periods of depressed mood. Within her family, she was known for angry outbursts. She had done well academically in high school but dropped out of college because of frustrations with a roommate and a professor.

She had attempted a series of internships and entry-level jobs with the expectation that she would return to college, but she kept quitting because “bosses are idiots. They come across as great and they all turn out to be twisted.” These “traumas” always left her feeling terrible about herself (“I can’t even succeed as a clerk?”) and angry at her bosses (“I could run the place and probably will”). She had dated men when she was younger but never let them get close physically because she became too anxious when any intimacy began to develop. Most of her friends from the neighborhood had “become frauds or losers,” while she had stayed “Facebook friends” with some friends from college, and they were all “doing amazing things all over the world. I’ll definitely meet up with them if they ever come back to town.”

Ms. Delgado said that she was generally “down and depressed” but that she had had dozens of 1- to 2-day “manias” in which she was energized and edgy and pulled all-nighters. She tended to “crash” the next day and sleep for 12 hours.

Ms. Delgado reported that she occasionally cut herself, “but only superficially.” She had persistent thoughts that she would be better off dead, and she had been psychiatrically hospitalized three times after overdoses.

She indicated that psychotherapy had never been especially helpful, nor had her medication treatments, which had included mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and low-dose antipsychotic medication.

Mrs. Delgado was a casually groomed and somewhat unkempt woman who was cooperative, coherent, and goal directed during the interview. She was generally dysphoric, with a constricted affect, but did smile appropriately several times. She described shame at her poor performance but also believed she was “on Earth to do something great.” She described her father as a spectacular success, but he was also a “Machiavellian loser who was always trying to manipulate people.” She described quitting jobs because people were disrespectful. Toward the end of the initial session, she became angry with the interviewer after he glanced at the clock (“Are you bored already?”).",Borderline personality disorder,dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Clarifying diagnosis criteria**

I’m thinking about how to approach diagnosing persistent depressive disorder (PDD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Clinicians often encounter dilemmas in coding both, but according to the DSM, they shouldn't. PDD replaces dysthymia and chronic major depression. If someone has met MDD criteria for two years, only PDD should be diagnosed. However, if it's less than that, PDD with intermittent major depressive episodes is appropriate. It seems sticking to either PDD or MDD is better for adherence to guidelines.

**Evaluating diagnosis options**

I need to base my evaluation on evidence. The user seems anxious about intimacy, which could point to ""Avoidant personality disorder"" or ""Social anxiety disorder,"" but the evidence isn’t strong enough. An alternative could be ""Paranoid personality disorder"" because of her suspiciousness, but that could also mean she's experiencing transient paranoid ideation from BPD. I could consider ""Cyclothymic disorder"" too, as a differential diagnosis. Overall, cyclothymic disorder seems most appropriate since her symptoms likely span years and include recurrent depressed mood.

**Analyzing cyclothymic symptoms**

In cyclothymia, mood symptoms need to last at least two years without being absent for more than two months, which seems plausible. However, if she has major depressive episodes, that complicates things. The severe depression lasting six months seems significant, but it might not fully meet MDE criteria. Still, being in bed for that long indicates severity. Cyclothymia also causes significant distress. Mood stabilizers might help with cyclothymia, but they didn’t in her case. Her reactions to job-related stress sound more like BPD than cyclothymia.

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

The case appears to show traits consistent with borderline personality disorder (BPD), especially with possibly misinterpreted brief manias, so I’ll include bipolar spectrum as secondary. The final diagnostic list I’m considering is: 

1. Borderline personality disorder - F60.3  
2. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe without psychotic features - F33.2  
3. Other specified bipolar and related disorder - F31.89  
4. Narcissistic personality disorder - F60.81  
5. Paranoid personality disorder - F60.0 or Avoidant personality disorder - F60.6.  

Her cognitive style, marked by splitting in how she views others, supports the BPD diagnosis.

**Determining the top diagnoses**

Navigating the diagnosis options is tricky. Diagnosing Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) alongside bipolar disorder could lead to double counting, as MDD is often superseded by bipolar diagnoses. However, if episodes fit the criteria for ""Other specified bipolar and related disorder"" due to short hypomanic episodes, I believe it’s important to avoid separate MDD diagnosis. 

Given the symptoms and the individual's condition, I propose the following top diagnoses: Borderline Personality Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Other Specified Bipolar Disorder, Narcissistic Personality Disorder, and Persistent Depressive Disorder.

**Finalizing diagnostic list**

1. Borderline personality disorder - F60.3  
2. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe without psychotic features - F33.2

175,"Karmen Fuentes was a 50-year-old married Hispanic woman who presented to the psychiatric emergency room (ER) at the urging of her outpatient psychiatrist after telling him that she had been thinking about overdosing on Advil.

In the ER, Ms. Fuentes explained that her back had been “killing” her since she fell several days earlier at the family-owned grocery store where she had worked for many years. The fall had left her downcast and depressed, although she denied other depressive symptoms aside from a poor mood. She spoke at length about the fall and about how it reminded her of a fall that she had sustained a few years earlier. At that time, she had gone to see a neurosurgeon, who told her to rest and take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. She described feeling “abandoned and not cared about” by him. The pain had diminished her ability to exercise, and she was upset that she had gained weight. While relating the events surrounding the fall, Ms. Fuentes began to cry.

When asked about her suicidal comments, she said they were “no big deal”—they were “just a threat” aimed at her husband to “teach him a lesson” because “he has no compassion for me” and had not been supportive since the fall. She insisted that her comments about overdosing did not have another meaning. When her ER interviewer expressed concern about the possibility that she would kill herself, she exclaimed with a smile, “Oh wow, I didn’t realize it’s so serious. I guess I shouldn’t do that again.” She then shrugged and laughed. She went on to talk about how “nice and sweet” it was that so many doctors and social workers wanted to hear her story, calling many of them by their first names. She was also somewhat flirtatious with her male resident interviewer, who had mentioned that she was the “best-dressed woman in the ER.”

According to her outpatient psychiatrist of 3 years, she had never before expressed suicidal ideation until this week, and he would be unable to check in on her until after he left on vacation the next day. Ms. Fuentes’s husband reported that she talked about suicide “like other people complain about the weather. She’s just trying to get me worried, but it doesn’t work anymore.” He said he would never have suggested she go to the ER and thought the psychiatrist had overreacted.

Ms. Fuentes initially sought outpatient psychotherapy at age 47 because she was feeling depressed and unsupported by her husband. During 3 years of outpatient treatment, Ms. Fuentes had been prescribed adequate trials of sertraline, escitalopram, fluoxetine, and paroxetine. None seemed to help.

Ms. Fuentes described being “an early bloomer.” She became sexually active with older men when she was in high school. She said dating had been the most fun thing she had ever done and that she missed seeing men “jump through hoops” to sleep with her. She lived with her 73-year-old husband. Her 25-year-old son lived nearby with his wife and young son. She described her husband as a “very famous” musician. She said that he had never helped around the house or with child-rearing and did not appreciate how much work she put into taking care of their son and grandson.",Histrionic personality disorder,dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Clarifying depressive disorder codes**

So, “Unspecified depressive disorder” could map to F32.9, which is the same as Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) single episode unspecified. The DSM-5 uses F32.9 for both, but there's also F32.A (Depression, unspecified), although that’s not widely recognized. F32.8 is another option for ""Other depressive episodes."" I should check on the DSM-5 for specifics on ""Other specified depressive disorder"" which could relate to F32.8. However, codes like ""Depressive disorder due to another medical condition"" (F06.31) could also apply.

**Evaluating potential diagnoses**

I think F54 might be a reasonable choice since it addresses ""Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions."" This fits because she has back pain and shows distress with maladaptive behaviors, like suicidal threats. However, F54 isn't a mental disorder per se. The user asked for F-code mental disorders, so I need to focus on the top five likely diagnoses. I could consider including ""Other specified personality disorder"" (F60.89) or ""Cluster B personality disorder, unspecified"" (F60.9), though we also have histrionic traits to consider.

**Assessing potential diagnoses**

I’m looking into evidence for histrionic personality disorder (PD) based on her age and behaviors. She engages in early sexual activity, enjoys attention, and even uses suicidal threats, which indicates a strong case for histrionic PD. For adjustment disorder, she seems downcast after a fall, which fits with depressed mood, and although there's mention of suicidal ideation, she labels it as a threat rather than a true desire. Regarding somatic symptom disorder, she has back pain, but I'd need to confirm if symptoms are still present for the required timeframe.

**Determining potential diagnoses**

The user has mentioned pain since a fall a few days ago, and there's a possibility of chronic back pain episodes. However, it doesn't seem persistent enough to diagnose somatic symptom disorder (SSD). Illness anxiety disorder might also not be appropriate here. Instead, ""Other specified somatic symptom and related disorder"" (F45.8) could be a consideration, but it needs to be plausible. For secondary diagnoses, I can think about including personality disorders, like “Other specified personality disorder” (mixed Cluster B features) with histrionic traits, but I need to ensure each diagnosis is supported.

**Identifying potential diagnoses**

It seems that the case may align more closely with Histrionic Personality Disorder rather than major depression. The primary diagnosis could be Histrionic PD, with adjustment disorder as a secondary one due to her depressed mood after a fall. I might also consider Borderline Personality Disorder based on her emotional instability. Other possible diagnoses include Somatic Symptom Disorder and Other Specified Depressive Disorder, given her chronic depression. I need to ensure the top five diagnoses are plausible while supporting her complex symptoms.

**Finalizing diagnosis codes**

I need to finalize the diagnosis list while ensuring proper formatting. The primary diagnosis could be ""Histrionic Personality Disorder"" with code F60.4. For secondary diagnoses, I'll include ""Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood"" (F43.21), ""Borderline Personality Disorder"" (F60.3), ""Somatic Symptom Disorder, with predominant pain"" (F45.1), and ""Unspecified Depressive Disorder"" (F32.9) since her symptoms don't meet the full criteria for other specified diagnoses. I want to reflect on her presentation while ensuring accuracy in the classifications.

**Finalizing diagnosis ranking**

I need to finalize the top five diagnoses carefully, focusing on proper formatting and emphasis on psychiatric codes. The primary diagnosis should be ""Histrionic Personality Disorder"" (F60.4), followed by ""Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood"" (F43.21) as the secondary. The third might be ""Other Specified Depressive Disorder"" (F32.8) since she has depressive symptoms without meeting full criteria. I may keep ""Somatic Symptom Disorder"" (F45.1) and ""Borderline Personality Disorder"" (F60.3), but the ranking needs to reflect their likelihood based on the case details.

**Preparing final diagnosis list**

I need to consider the most pronounced features here. It seems like she has a histrionic pattern: dramatic, attention-seeking, and flirtatious. Now, it’s important to finalize the top five diagnoses. I’ll include:

1. Histrionic Personality Disorder - F60.4  
2. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood - F43.21  
3. Somatic Symptom Disorder, with predominant pain - F45.1  
4. Unspecified Depressive Disorder - F32.9  
5. Borderline Personality Disorder - F60.3  

While borderline is debatable, it can still be included as a possibility. This list reflects our findings accurately without further commentary.","1. Histrionic Personality Disorder - F60.4

176,"Larry Goranov was a 57-year-old man who demanded an expert review of the psychiatric care that he had received for the prior 7 years at a psychiatric clinic connected to a medical school. Mr. Goranov indicated to the clinic’s psychiatric director that he had been depressed for many years, but weekly psychotherapy and multiple different psychiatric medications had made no difference.

Mr. Goranov reported feeling sad, tired, and frustrated “for decades.” He rarely looked forward to anything. He had lost his last job 3 years earlier, had broken up with a girlfriend slightly later, and doubted that he would ever work or date again. He was embarrassed that he still lived with his mother, who was in her 80s. He denied any immediate intention or plan to kill himself, but stated that if he did not improve by the time his mother died, he did not see what he would have to live for. He denied disturbances in sleep, appetite, or concentration.

Clinic records indicated that Mr. Goranov had been adherent to adequate trials of fluoxetine, escitalopram, sertraline, duloxetine, venlafaxine, and bupropion, as well as augmentation with quetiapine, aripiprazole, lithium, and levothyroxine. He had experienced some improvement in his mood while taking escitalopram but did not have remission of symptoms. He also received a course of cognitive-behavioral therapy early in his treatment, but he had been dismissive of the therapist and treatment, did not do his assigned homework, and appeared to make no effort to use the therapy between sessions.

Mr. Goranov expressed frustration at his lack of improvement, the nature of his treatment, and his specific therapy. He found it “humiliating” that he was forced to see trainees who rotated off his case every year or two. He frequently found that the psychiatry residents were not especially educated, cultured, or sophisticated, and thought that they knew less about psychotherapy than he did. He much preferred to work with female therapists “because at least they’re pretty, and men are too competitive and envious.”

Mr. Goranov had worked as an insurance broker from age 25 to 40. He explained, “It’s ridiculous. I was the best broker they had ever seen, but I still can’t get a job. I think the problem is that the profession is filled with big egos, and I can’t keep my mouth shut about it.” After being “blackballed” by insurance agencies, Mr. Goranov did not work for 5 years, until he was hired by an automobile dealer. He said that although it was beneath him to sell cars, he was successful, and “in no time, I was running the place.” He quit within a few months after an argument with the owner. Despite encouragement from several therapists, Mr. Goranov had not applied for a job or pursued employment rehabilitation or volunteer work; he strongly viewed these options as beneath him.

Mr. Goranov has “given up on women.” He had many partners as a younger man, but he generally found them to be unappreciative and “only in it for the free meals.” Psychotherapy notes from the clinic indicate that he responded to demonstrations of interest with suspicion. This tendency held true in regard to both women who had tried to befriend him and therapists who had taken an interest in his care. Mr. Goranov described himself as someone who had a lot of love to give, but added that the world was full of manipulators. He said he had a few buddies, but his mother was the only one he truly cared about. His parents had emigrated from Eastern Europe when he was a child. He had no siblings, and his father had died when the patient was 41. He had met a few relatives over the years, “but they didn’t speak English, so I didn’t pay them much attention.” He enjoyed fine restaurants and “five-star hotels,” but he added that he could no longer afford them. He exercised daily and was concerned about maintaining his body. Most of his time was spent at home watching television or reading novels and biographies.

On examination, the patient was neatly groomed, had slicked-back hair, and wore designer hip-hop-inspired clothing generally favored by men in their 20s. He was coherent, goal directed, and generally cooperative. He said he was sad and angry. His affect was constricted and dismissive. He denied an intention to kill himself but felt hopeless and thought of death fairly often. He was cognitively intact.",Narcissistic personality disorder,dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Clarifying diagnoses for MDD and PDD**

I’m looking at the DSM criteria, and it seems if the criteria for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) are met for at least two years, the diagnosis would actually be Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD). MDD shouldn’t be listed separately, but it could be included as a secondary differential if needed. I must focus on providing the structured list of diagnoses as requested, and avoid unnecessary exclusions like specific personality disorders unless they clearly apply.

**Analyzing behavior and diagnoses**

I’m examining the behavior, which shows a lack of engagement with the therapist; dismissiveness and not completing homework could suggest negative expectations. There’s a suspicion of interest from him, possibly pointing to paranoia. He might have a delusional disorder due to his belief of being blackballed by insurance agencies, but that could also stem from seeing the world as manipulative. He seems cognitively intact with no signs of psychosis. Persistent Depressive Disorder could fit, along with possibly a personality disorder with narcissistic and paranoid traits, or categorizing it under ""Other specified personality disorder.""

**Evaluating diagnosis codes and options**

I need to review the ICD-10 codes carefully since the instructions specify F-codes, which might refer to either ICD-10 or ICD-10-CM. F60.89 relates to ""Other specified personality disorders,"" while many in the U.S. will use the ICD-10-CM coding, such as F60.81 for Narcissistic Personality Disorder and F60.0 for Paranoid Personality Disorder. I'll also consider Persistent Depressive Disorder (F34.1) along with Avoidant Personality Disorder (F60.6). 

Avoidant Personality Disorder has criteria that indicate avoidance due to fear of criticism and an overall self-view of social ineptness. It's important to weigh all these factors for a precise diagnosis.

**Assessing potential personality disorders**

I’ve realized he avoids jobs and volunteering not out of fear, but because he sees them as beneath him. This suggests he might not have Dependent Personality Disorder, which involves excessive reliance on others. There’s consideration for Schizoid Personality Disorder, but while he seems indifferent to relationships, he enjoys fine dining and seeks connections, albeit with suspicion. 

Paranoid Personality Disorder might fit better, and I’m exploring the possibility of him having Persistent Depressive Disorder alongside it and possibly Narcissistic Personality Disorder. I need to find a couple more diagnoses to round it out.

**Selecting potential psychiatric diagnoses**

I am considering possible diagnoses for this individual, based on chronic depressed mood, interpersonal dysfunction, and treatment non-response. Persistent Depressive Disorder seems like a primary possibility. There’s also room for Narcissistic Personality Disorder and Paranoid Personality Disorder. Major Depressive Disorder could serve as a differential diagnosis. 

While I have to confidently identify five possible diagnoses aligned with the information, I'll keep in mind to avoid fabricating details and prioritize what's plausible based on what’s available. This might include Unspecified Depressive Disorder too, depending on how the symptoms align.

**Identifying diagnostic codes**

I’m sifting through potential diagnostic options and their respective codes. For Persistent Depressive Disorder, I’m using F34.1. Narcissistic Personality Disorder could fit with F60.81, and F60.0 for Paranoid Personality Disorder. I’m considering the possibility of Major Depressive Disorder with recurrent episodes, possibly F33.1 or F33.9. 

However, I want to ensure I don’t duplicate, so I’ll stick with a solid five diagnoses that capture his symptoms, including some differentials to reflect the complexity of his case, keeping it plausible without stretching the truth. Let's finalize the list!

**Finalizing diagnostic options**

I'm narrowing down the possible diagnoses: I think the primary one should be Persistent Depressive Disorder (F34.1). Next, I’d list Narcissistic Personality Disorder (F60.81) and Paranoid Personality Disorder (F60.0). For the fourth diagnosis, I’m considering Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, unspecified (F33.9) due to his chronic symptoms. 

I need to be sure to include a fifth option but avoid any redundancy. It's a delicate balance since we want to reflect the overall picture without complicating things too much. Let’s finalize this list!

**Confirming diagnosis options**

I’m dissecting how to best categorize this case. I realize that Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) isn’t separately diagnosed if Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD) applies but recurrent episodes can still be relevant for billing. It seems that when criteria for MDD are met, it can indeed be diagnosed alongside PDD. 

So, my final list might include: Persistent Depressive Disorder (F34.1), Narcissistic Personality Disorder (F60.81), Paranoid Personality Disorder (F60.0), and perhaps treat MDD as a differential or unspecified depressive disorder based on his symptoms. Choosing these reflects a clear picture of his presentation!

**Finalizing diagnoses**

I’m considering various diagnoses for this case. There’s a possibility of Schizotypal or Antisocial Personality Disorder, but those don't seem quite right. Instead, maybe I can include Persistent Depressive Disorder, Narcissistic Personality Disorder, and Paranoid Personality Disorder among the top five.

I'm weighing the need for five distinct diagnoses and contemplating how his symptoms align with that. I think I’ll summarize it like this: Persistent Depressive Disorder, Narcissistic Personality Disorder, Paranoid Personality Disorder, and ""Other Specified Personality Disorder."" I might lean on the idea that NPD is central, making it the primary diagnosis!

**Choosing primary diagnosis**

I'm evaluating the case, focusing on depressed mood and impairment from personality features. The depressive symptoms seem chronic but may be impacted by personality traits.

Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) appears likely, meeting many criteria: grandiosity, entitlement, and arrogance. But I struggle with whether to label this or Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD) as primary. Ultimately, since he seeks treatment for depression, I’m inclined to choose PDD as primary to address the most acute concerns, even though NPD is a significant underlying factor. It’s a tough call, but this seems the best approach!

**Listing possible diagnoses**

I'm tasked with structuring the top five diagnoses, and it seems that many would lean towards Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD) as primary. However, Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) is also a strong contender. Given that treatment-resistant depression often guides diagnosis, I might choose PDD. 

For secondary diagnoses, I could consider NPD, Paranoid Personality Disorder, and possibly Major Depressive Disorder as differentials. I need to ensure there's no redundancy in my choices, which might lead to some tough decisions. Ultimately, I can compile a list of: 

1. Persistent Depressive Disorder (F34.1)  
2. Narcissistic Personality Disorder (F60.81)  
3. Paranoid Personality Disorder (F60.0)  
4. Major Depressive Disorder, unspecified (F33.9)  
5. Other specified personality disorder (F60.89).  

It's a balancing act, but I think I’m onto a solid structure!

**Identifying potential diagnoses**

I’m working on listing the top five diagnoses, keeping in mind all the nuances. We could consider ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" or ""Depressive disorder due to another medical condition"" but maybe those aren’t well supported here. 

It's crucial to stick to evidence, so I should prioritize diagnoses that align with the vignette. The main candidates include:

1. Persistent Depressive Disorder 
2. Narcissistic Personality Disorder 
3. Paranoid Personality Disorder 
4. Major Depressive Disorder 
5. Other Specified Personality Disorder.

I need to ensure each has some backing from the information provided!

**Listing potential diagnoses**

I'm diving into the possible diagnoses I might consider. He doesn't seem to desire close relationships, but he does care about his mother, so that's a 0. He enjoys solitary activities and fine dining, which might indicate some underlying issues. I could look at ""Persistent Depressive Disorder,"" ""Narcissistic Personality Disorder,"" and ""Paranoid Personality Disorder"" as key candidates. 

As for rounding out the list, I might also include ""Major Depressive Disorder"" and perhaps ""Other Specified Personality Disorder,"" focusing on his mixed traits.

**Formulating potential diagnoses**

I'm trying to determine the most fitting diagnoses based on the user's symptoms. There's a consideration of ""Persistent Depressive Disorder"" due to long-standing depression and ""Narcissistic Personality Disorder."" I’m contemplating ""Paranoid Personality Disorder"" and looking into ""Other Specified Depressive Disorder"" as a candidate. 

I’m aiming to compile a clear list of five diagnoses. For example, including diagnoses like ""Major Depressive Disorder"" might be tricky due to the absence of typical symptoms. Accountability to the instruction is key, so I want to ensure these effective diagnoses reflect his current state accurately.

**Listing differential diagnoses**

I want to create a differential for chronic depression with personality features. First, I’ll consider persistent depressive disorder, major depressive disorder, and adjustment disorder with depressed mood. 

While I’m noting symptoms and possible diagnoses, I recognize the importance of selecting the top five. For codes, I’ll include F34.1 for persistent depressive disorder, F60.81 for narcissistic personality disorder, and possibly others. I'm also weighing the inclusion of adjustment disorder or other specified personality disorders, aiming for a clear and accurate understanding. Let's finalize the choices!

**Formulating diagnostic list**

I need to establish the top five likely diagnoses for the user while ensuring to present them in the correct format. I’ll focus on persistent depressive disorder (PDD) as the primary diagnosis, along with major depressive disorder (MDD) as a secondary if applicable. My list of ICD-10 codes will strictly follow the DSM-5-TR naming conventions. 

I’m considering options, and it seems best to finalize with PDD, narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), paranoid personality disorder, major depressive disorder, and possibly unspecified depressive disorder or an other specified personality disorder. Let's finalize the list clearly and accurately!

**Establishing diagnostic possibilities**

I'm evaluating potential conditions that could explain the symptoms while ensuring I keep the list concise, just as requested. We need to consider both depressive and personality disorders and maintain the ICD-10 F code format. 

I'm leaning towards persistent depressive disorder (PDD) as the primary diagnosis, followed by narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) and potentially paranoid personality disorder. Next, I’ll include major depressive disorder if applicable and then narrow it down to either unspecified depressive disorder or another specified personality disorder. It's important to finalize this list without additional reasoning.

**Determining diagnostic criteria**

I'm sorting through possible conditions, highlighting the most severe symptoms. There’s a chance the individual has moderate major depressive disorder due to significant hopelessness. I could diagnose persistent depressive disorder (PDD) as primary and list narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) alongside paranoid personality disorder. I might also include unspecified depressive disorder; however, I'm concerned about coherence in my choices. 

Ultimately, here’s my proposed list: 

1. Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) - F34.1
2. Narcissistic personality disorder - F60.81
3. Paranoid personality disorder - F60.0
4. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, unspecified - F33.9
5. Other specified depressive disorder - F32.8

**Finalizing diagnostic list**

I'm working on finalizing a list of possible diagnoses. It's challenging to determine if the individual meets the criteria for both persistent depressive disorder and a major depressive episode, but I think I’ll stick with ""Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia)"" as the primary diagnosis.

Here's the list I'm considering:

1. Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) - ICD-10 F34.1
2. Narcissistic personality disorder - ICD-10 F60.81
3. Paranoid personality disorder - ICD-10 F60.0
4. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, unspecified - ICD-10 F33.9
5. Other specified depressive disorder - ICD-10 F32.8

I'm weighing other options for the fifth diagnosis, but I feel this captures the most likely conditions.

**Finalizing diagnostic list**

I'm trying to determine the best structured list of diagnoses based on the information provided. For the primary diagnosis, I’m going with ""Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) - F34.1."" 

The rest of my list looks like this:

1. Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) - F34.1
2. Narcissistic personality disorder - F60.81
3. Paranoid personality disorder - F60.0
4. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, unspecified - F33.9
5. Unspecified depressive disorder - F32.9

I’ll ensure the codes are accurate and consistent with the diagnoses.

**Determining final diagnoses**

I'm focusing on which diagnostic codes to use, particularly regarding unspecified depressive disorders and mapping to ICD-10. There's a possibility that F32.9 is used for unspecified depression, but I think we might want to avoid redundancy in our final list. After considering various personality and depressive disorders, I think it’s best to prioritize clear F-codes and relevant conditions.

Here’s what I've settled on:

1. Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) - F34.1
2. Narcissistic personality disorder - F60.81
3. Paranoid personality disorder - F60.0
4. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, unspecified - F33.9
5. Other specified depressive disorder - F32.8

**Finalizing diagnoses**

I'm considering whether to include ""Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), with persistent major depressive episode,"" but it seems I can't confirm the patient's symptoms meet the full criteria for major depression. Since he denies essential symptoms like sleep and appetite changes, it’s safer not to include that specifier. 

So, here's the final structured list I’ve crafted:

1. Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) - F34.1  
2. Narcissistic personality disorder - F60.81  
3. Paranoid personality disorder - F60.0  
4. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, unspecified - F33.9  
5. Other specified depressive disorder - F32.8","1. Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) - F34.1

177,"Mathilda Herbert was a 23-year-old woman referred for psychiatric consultation to help her “break out of her shell.” She had recently moved to a new city to take classes to become an industrial lab technician and had moved in with an older cousin, who was also a psychotherapist and thought she should “get out and enjoy her youth.”

Although she had previously been prescribed medications for anxiety, Ms. Herbert said that her real problem was “shyness.” School was difficult because everyone was constantly “criticizing.” She avoided being called on in class because she knew she would “say something stupid” and blush and everyone would make fun of her. She avoided speaking up or talking on telephones, worried about how she would sound. She dreaded public speaking.

She was similarly reticent with friends. She said she had always been a people pleaser who preferred to hide her feelings with a cheerful, compliant, attentive demeanor. She had a few friends, whom she described as “warm and lifelong.” She felt lonely after her recent move and had not yet met anyone from school or the local community.

She said she had broken up with her first serious boyfriend 2 years earlier. He had initially been “kind and patient.” Through him, she had a social life by proxy. Soon after she moved in with him, however, he turned out to be an “angry alcoholic.” She had not dated since that experience.

Ms. Herbert grew up in a metropolitan area with her parents and three older siblings. Her brother was “hyperactive and antisocial” and took up everyone’s attention, whereas her sisters were “hypercompetitive and perfect.” Her mother was anxiously compliant, “like me.” Ms. Herbert’s father was a very successful investment manager who often pointed out ways in which his children did not live up to his expectations. He could be supportive but tended to disregard emotional uncertainty in favor of a “tough optimism.” Teasing and competition “saturated” the household, and “it didn’t help that I was forced to go to the same girls’ school where my sisters had been stars and where everyone was rich and catty.” She developed a keen sensitivity to criticism and failure.

Her parents divorced during her senior year of high school. Her father married another woman soon thereafter. Although she had planned to attend the same elite university as her two sisters, she chose to attend a local community college at the last minute. She explained that it was good to be away from all the competition, and her mother needed the support.

Ms. Herbert’s strengths included excellent work in her major, chemistry, especially after one senior professor took a special interest. Family camping trips had led to a mastery of outdoor skills, and she found that she enjoyed being out in the woods, flexing her independence. She also enjoyed babysitting and volunteering in animal shelters, because kids and animals “appreciate everything you do and aren’t mean.”

During the evaluation, Ms. Herbert was a well-dressed young woman of short stature who was attentive, coherent, and goal directed. She smiled a lot, especially when talking about things that would have made most people angry. When the psychiatrist offered a trial comment, linking Ms. Herbert’s current anxiety to experiences with her father, the patient said nothing but was visibly upset. After several such instances, the psychiatrist worried that any interpretive comments might be taken as criticism and had to check a tendency to avoid sensitive subjects. Explicitly discussing his concerns led both the patient and psychiatrist to relax and allowed the conversation to continue more productively.","1. Avoidant personality disorder
2. Social anxiety disorder",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Deciding on diagnoses**

I'm thinking that it's okay to include less certain diagnoses as secondary ones. I need four secondaries, so I could include ""Other specified personality disorder (mixed dependent/avoidant traits)"" but I'm unsure if we should since we already have avoidant and dependent listed. I see that the primary focus might be on Avoidant Personality Disorder, which seems more pervasive. Meanwhile, Social Anxiety Disorder could be present too. It's interesting to note the nuances between them!

**Evaluating personality traits**

I'm noticing that she has few lasting friendships, which aligns with avoidant personality traits. Her tendency to be a people pleaser could also be related. During evaluations, she seems distressed by interpretive comments, indicating hypersensitivity to criticism, which supports the avoidant personality diagnosis. For the DSM-5-TR criteria, she likely meets some of the requirements. For instance, she avoids situations that might involve criticism and shows reluctance to connect with new people, likely stemming from past experiences.

**Assessing personality characteristics**

I've identified that she is preoccupied with being criticized or rejected in social situations, feeling inadequate in new interactions, and viewing herself as socially inept. This implies she often fears saying something stupid. Additionally, she is reluctant to take personal risks, avoiding situations where she might feel embarrassed. It seems she likely meets the criteria for both Avoidant Personality Disorder and possibly Social Anxiety Disorder, which includes persistent fear of negative evaluation and impairment in daily life. Her cheerful demeanor may also reflect traits of Dependent Personality.

**Analyzing personality criteria**

I’m considering the criteria for Dependent Personality Disorder, such as difficulty making decisions without reassurance, needing others to take responsibility, and feeling uncomfortable when alone. Given her supportive nature, particularly towards her mother, it might be more appropriate to diagnose her with ""Other Specified Personality Disorder (Dependent Traits)"" rather than full Blown Dependent Personality Disorder. There’s also a possibility of Generalized Anxiety Disorder due to her worries about criticism, but I’m unsure about that too. It’s tricky to pin down the right diagnosis!

**Diagnosing personality and anxiety disorders**

I’m analyzing her symptoms, noting that her history suggests avoidant personality traits, but she also displays signs of social anxiety. Her pervasive sensitivity to criticism and fear of being judged align with these diagnoses, and it seems that she could meet the criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder. However, we need to provide the top five diagnoses. I’m leaning towards including both Social Anxiety and Avoidant Personality Disorders since they overlap, with a consideration for Adjustment Disorder due to her recent move and feelings of loneliness. We may have other possibilities to explore, but I want to keep it concise!

**Finalizing diagnostic list**

I need to create a structured list of diagnoses without showing my reasoning. The focus is on the top five most likely options, and I want to ensure they are plausible according to DSM-5-TR criteria. I'm considering including Avoidant Personality Disorder as primary, along with Social Anxiety Disorder. There might also be room for Dependent Personality Disorder, but I’m leaning towards ""Other Specified Personality Disorder"" to capture mixed traits. Finally, I could include Generalized Anxiety Disorder or Adjustment Disorder if they fit her profile.

**Finalizing DSM-5 diagnostic list**

I need to select five plausible psychiatric diagnoses based on the information provided. The strongest candidates seem to be: 

1. Social Anxiety Disorder - F40.10 
2. Avoidant Personality Disorder - F60.6 
3. Dependent Personality Disorder - F60.7 
4. Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety - F43.22 
5. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder - F41.9 

I have to ensure that each diagnosis aligns well with the user's symptoms. Overall, my focus is on creating a structured, accurate list without including unsupported details.

**Finalizing diagnostic considerations**

I need to finalize a list of five likely psychiatric diagnoses based on the information provided. The top candidates I’m considering are:

1. Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia) - F40.10
2. Avoidant Personality Disorder - F60.6
3. Other Specified Personality Disorder (dependent personality features) - F60.89
4. Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety - F43.22
5. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder - F41.9

This selection reflects the most plausible options given the user's situation and symptoms without adding unsupported diagnoses.

**Refining diagnostic options**

I’m considering the five most plausible psychiatric diagnoses. For the primary diagnosis, I'm leaning towards Avoidant Personality Disorder as it encompasses long-standing patterns of social inhibition and hypersensitivity to criticism. The secondary diagnosis would be Social Anxiety Disorder because it overlaps but is more symptomatic. 

The final list I’m formulating includes:
1. Avoidant Personality Disorder - F60.6
2. Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia) - F40.10
3. Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety - F43.22
4. Other Specified Personality Disorder (dependent traits) - F60.89
5. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder - F41.9

This selection reflects the user’s symptoms comprehensively.

**Evaluating personality and anxiety disorders**

I'm reviewing whether symptoms are better explained by Social Anxiety Disorder or Avoidant Personality Disorder. While social anxiety can lead to avoidance and sensitivity to criticism, features like people-pleasing and limited relationships suggest a deeper problem. 

For the final diagnoses, I'm leaning towards:  
1. Avoidant Personality Disorder - F60.6  
2. Social Anxiety Disorder - F40.10  
3. Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety - F43.22  
4. Other Specified Personality Disorder (dependent traits) - F60.89  
5. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder - F41.9  

This selection captures the nuances of her condition.

**Creating a structured diagnosis list**

My task is to finalize a list of potential diagnoses based on the DSM-5-TR criteria. It appears clear that I should include:  

1. Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia) - F40.10  
2. Avoidant Personality Disorder - F60.6  
3. Other Specified Personality Disorder (dependent traits) - F60.89  
4. Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety - F43.22  
5. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder - F41.9  

This gives a concise viewpoint without additional details—all aligned with the DSM-5-TR.

**Finalizing the diagnosis list**

I need to confirm the list of diagnoses, focusing solely on the appropriate ICD-10 F codes. Here's the list I'm putting together:  

1. Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia) - F40.10  
2. Avoidant Personality Disorder - F60.6  
3. Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety - F43.22  
4. Other Specified Personality Disorder (dependent traits) - F60.89  
5. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder - F41.9  

I’ll keep it concise with no extra commentary, as instructed.

**Finalizing the diagnosis list**

I’ve been thinking about the appropriate diagnoses and how to order them. Here’s my list based on what I've processed:

1. Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia) - F40.10

178,"Nate Irvin was a 31-year-old single white man who sought outpatient psychiatric services for “lack of self-confidence.” He reported lifelong troubles with assertiveness and was specifically upset by having been “stuck” for 2 years at his current “dead-end” job as an administrative assistant. He wished someone would tell him where to go next so that he would not have to face the “burden” of decision. At work, he found it easy to follow his boss’s directions but had difficulty making even minor independent decisions. The situation was “depressing,” he said, but nothing new.

Mr. Irvin also reported dissatisfaction with his relationships with women. He described a series of several-month-long relationships over the prior 10 years that ended despite his doing “everything I could” and “never getting angry or yelling.” His most recent relationship had been with an opera singer. He reported having gone to several operas and taken singing classes to impress her, even though he did not particularly enjoy music. That relationship had recently ended for unclear reasons. He said his mood and self-confidence were tied to his dating. Being single made him feel desperate, but desperation made it even harder to get a girlfriend. He said he felt trapped by that spiral. Since the latest breakup, he had been quite sad, with frequent crying spells. It was this depression that had prompted him to seek treatment. He denied all other symptoms of depression, including problems with sleep, appetite, energy, suicidality, and ability to enjoy things.

Mr. Irvin initially denied taking any medications, but he eventually revealed that 1 year earlier his primary care physician had begun to prescribe alprazolam 0.5 mg/day for “anxiety.” His dose had escalated, and at the time of the evaluation, Mr. Irvin was taking 5 mg/day and getting prescriptions from three different physicians. Cutting back led to anxiety and “the shakes.”

Mr. Irvin denied any prior personal or family psychiatric history, including outpatient psychiatric appointments.

After hearing this history, the psychiatrist was concerned about Mr. Irvin’s escalating alprazolam use and his chronic difficulties with independence. She thought the most accurate diagnosis was benzodiazepine use disorder comorbid with a personality disorder. However, she was concerned about the negative unintended effects that these diagnoses might have on the patient, including his employment and insurance coverage, as well as how he would be dealt with by future clinicians. She typed into the electronic medical record a diagnosis of “adjustment disorder with depressed mood.” Two weeks later, Mr. Irvin’s insurance company asked her for his diagnosis, and she gave the same diagnosis.","1. Dependent personality disorder
2. Benzodiazepine use disorder",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Evaluating criteria for substance use**

I'm looking at various criteria for substance use, like how long someone has been using, their cravings, and if they're failing to meet obligations. There’s evidence of tolerance, as seen with dosage increases, and withdrawal symptoms like anxiety and shakes when trying to cut back. It seems he’s likely seeking prescriptions from multiple doctors, which indicates further issues. From this, it looks like he meets at least three criteria, suggesting a moderate to severe level of substance use.

**Assessing Dependent Personality Disorder**

I'm evaluating criteria for Dependent Personality Disorder, needing at least five out of eight. It appears he has trouble making decisions without reassurance, indicating he might need help with that. He relies on others for career decisions and hesitates to express disagreement. Engaging in activities to impress, like attending operas, suggests he goes to excessive lengths for support. Feeling uncomfortable or helpless when alone and urgently seeking another relationship shows more signs. Overall, he seems to meet the criteria for Dependent Personality Disorder.

**Determining diagnoses for adjustment disorder**

I’m looking into the diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, which appears to fit due to the recent breakup and associated symptoms. I see we need four secondary diagnoses. Aside from Dependent Personality Disorder and Adjustment Disorder, sedative use might be critical. I consider ""Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal"" as he experiences withdrawal symptoms, and maybe ""Unspecified Anxiety Disorder"" to reflect underlying anxiety. I need to clarify which five diagnoses are most likely overall, aiming for a comprehensive assessment.

**Exploring possible diagnoses**

I'm examining the patient's concerns about low self-confidence without depression. He might have ""Other Specified Personality Disorder"" based on his traits, or possibly ""Avoidant Personality Disorder,"" although he seems more dependent in nature. ""Anxiety Disorder due to another medical condition"" doesn’t fit, nor does ""Social Anxiety Disorder"" since he maintains relationships and jobs. ""Other Specified Personality Disorder with dependent features"" could work, but I feel confident about Dependent Personality Disorder. ""Separation Anxiety Disorder"" and ""Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety"" don’t apply either. Overall, I’m weighing my options carefully here.

**Selecting appropriate diagnoses**

I'm reviewing the required secondary diagnoses, aiming for a structured list of the top five likely diagnoses. The primary ones include: 1) Sedative/Hypnotic/Anxiolytic Use Disorder; 2) Dependent Personality Disorder; 3) Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood; and 4) Sedative/Hypnotic/Anxiolytic Withdrawal. For the fifth, I’m considering various options, like ""Unspecified Anxiety Disorder"" or alternative personality disorders. It appears he meets withdrawal criteria, and his low self-confidence leans towards Dependent Personality Disorder. Overall, I need to make sure these choices are coherent and evidence-based.

**Determining potential diagnoses**

I'm exploring possible diagnoses for the patient. It seems like they may have Avoidant Personality Disorder, given their fear of rejection and relationship challenges. However, they also might meet criteria for Dependent Personality Disorder based on their reliance and low self-confidence.

In terms of secondary diagnoses, I should consider Sedative/Hypnotic Use Disorder and its withdrawal symptoms. Another possibility is Unspecified Anxiety Disorder due to their anxiety when tapering off. I also need to avoid redundancy while ensuring I identify five distinct diagnoses that are supported by evidence and align with their symptoms.

**Evaluating diagnoses and coding**

I’m reviewing potential diagnoses and ICD-10-CM codes. For Sedative/Hypnotic Use Disorder, I could use F13.20 for uncomplicated and potentially F13.239 for withdrawal if applicable. However, the patient might not currently be in withdrawal, so F13.20 could suffice.

I need to choose five likely diagnoses. Options include Dependent Personality Disorder and Adjustment Disorder. Avoidant Personality Disorder is a possible differential based on self-confidence issues, but I shouldn’t add unless clear. Persistent Depressive Disorder might fit given the chronic nature of his low mood, though he doesn't fully meet all criteria.

**Identifying potential diagnoses**

I'm considering various diagnoses like ""Other Specified Depressive Disorder,"" which can apply when symptoms cause distress but don’t meet full criteria. However, ""Adjustment Disorder"" may be a better fit since it's tied to his breakup. There's also ""Sedative, Hypnotic Use Disorder,"" which could be impacting his mood and self-confidence. 

In terms of coding, I need to pinpoint F-codes, such as F13.20 for use disorder and maybe F13.239 for withdrawal. I want to establish a clear list of top five likely diagnoses based on his symptoms, ensuring I account for all the nuances.

**Determining top diagnoses**

I need to identify the top psychiatric diagnoses based on the patient’s symptoms. The primary diagnosis could be ""Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, severe"" due to the benzodiazepine usage. 

For secondary diagnoses, I might consider ""Dependent Personality Disorder,"" ""Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood,"" and ""Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Withdrawal."" Depending on the situation's nuances, including ""Unspecified Anxiety Disorder"" is plausible too, though there's ambiguity around it. 

It seems I need to focus on which diagnosis is most clinically relevant and impactful for the patient’s current issues.

**Finalizing psychiatric diagnoses**

I need to establish the top five psychiatric diagnoses for the patient. The primary diagnosis will likely be ""Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, severe"" (F13.20). 

For secondary diagnoses, I’m considering: ""Dependent Personality Disorder"" (F60.7), ""Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood"" (F43.21), and ""Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Withdrawal"" (F13.239). As for the fifth option, I see two possibilities: ""Unspecified Anxiety Disorder"" (F41.9) or ""Other Specified Depressive Disorder"" (F32.8). Given the context, the adjustment disorder might already encompass some aspects of his depression. So, I’ll finalize a list based on these considerations.

**Determining final diagnoses**

For this case, I’m narrowing down the diagnoses. The primary will be ""Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, severe"" (F13.20). For secondary diagnoses, I'll list ""Dependent Personality Disorder"" (F60.7), ""Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood"" (F43.21), and ""Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Withdrawal"" (F13.239). 

Now, for the fifth diagnosis, I'm considering ""Unspecified Anxiety Disorder"" (F41.9). This choice is tentative, as the anxiety may stem from withdrawal, but it’s the best option to ensure I have a complete list of five diagnoses, even if some are less certain.

**Finalizing diagnoses list**

I'm settling on ""Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, severe"" (F13.20) as the primary diagnosis. For the secondary diagnoses, I’ll list ""Dependent personality disorder"" (F60.7), ""Adjustment disorder with depressed mood"" (F43.21), and ""Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal"" (F13.239). 

For the fifth diagnosis, I think ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" (F41.9) might fit, considering he has anxiety symptoms relating to his situation, even though specifics aren't fully detailed. I aim to create a coherent list that represents the case accurately.

**Determining diagnoses categories**

I'm considering using additional diagnoses related to substance use, like ""Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, severe"" (F13.20) alongside withdrawal (F13.239). However, are intoxication symptoms present? I can list these along with ""Dependent personality disorder"" (F60.7), ""Adjustment disorder with depressed mood"" (F43.21), and ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" (F41.9).

For the fifth, I’m thinking about ""Other specified depressive disorder"" (F32.8) since symptoms seem present, but I need to ensure coherence and avoid conflicting diagnoses while keeping to the requested top five.

**Finalizing diagnosis considerations**

I'm assessing the potential diagnoses for this case, focusing on ""Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, severe"" (F13.20) and ""Dependent personality disorder"" (F60.7). There’s also ""Adjustment disorder with depressed mood"" (F43.21) and ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" (F41.9) to consider. I also need to note the withdrawal state with code (F13.239). I’m trying to determine if the anxiety is related to withdrawal or an underlying issue. Ultimately, I want to ensure the list has five plausible diagnoses while avoiding conflicts.

**Confirming diagnosis codes**

I need to ensure the accuracy of the ICD-10 codes for the diagnosis list. For the adjustment disorder with depressed mood, that's F43.21, and for dependent personality disorder, it's F60.7. The sedative dependence is F13.20, and the potential withdrawal code could be F13.230 for uncomplicated symptoms, as he exhibits tremors and anxiety. The final diagnosis will include unspecified anxiety disorder (F41.9). I'll compile these into a structured list, but I want to confirm they align to DSM-5 standards.

**Finalizing diagnosis codes**

I want to make sure the diagnosis codes I’m using are accurate. For the main disorder, I'll use “Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder” with the code F13.20. Next, I have “Dependent personality disorder” (F60.7) and “Adjustment disorder with depressed mood” (F43.21). For withdrawal, I can select either F13.239 or F13.230, but I think I’ll go with F13.239. Lastly, I'll include “Unspecified anxiety disorder” (F41.9). That gives me everything I need!","1. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder (benzodiazepine/alprazolam) - ICD-10 F13.20

179,"Ogden Judd, a 24-year-old attorney, and his boyfriend, Peter Kleinman, a 22-year-old freelance graphic designer, presented for couples therapy to address escalating conflict around the issue of moving in together. Mr. Kleinman described a several-month-long apartment search that was made “agonizing” by Mr. Judd’s work schedule and his “endless” list of apartment demands. They were unable to come to a decision, and eventually they decided to just share Mr. Judd’s apartment. As Mr. Kleinman concluded, “Ogden won.”

Mr. Judd refused to hire movers for his boyfriend’s belongings, insisting on personally packing and taking an inventory of every item in his boyfriend’s place. What should have taken 2 days took 1 week. Once the items were transported to Mr. Judd’s apartment, Mr. Kleinman began to complain about Mr. Judd’s “crazy rules” about where items could be placed on the bookshelf, which direction the hangers in the closet faced, and whether their clothes could be intermingled. Moreover, Mr. Kleinman complained that there was hardly any space for his possessions because Mr. Judd never threw anything away. “I’m terrified of losing something important,” added Mr. Judd.

Over the ensuing weeks, arguments broke out nightly as they unpacked boxes and settled in. Making matters worse, Mr. Judd would often come home after 9:00 or 10:00 p.m., because he had a personal rule to always have a blank “to-do” list by the end of the day. Mr. Kleinman would often wake early in the morning to find Mr. Judd grimly organizing shelves or closets or cleaning the floor. Throughout this process, Mr. Judd appeared to be working hard at everything while enjoying himself less and getting less done. Mr. Kleinman found himself feeling increasingly detached from his boyfriend the longer they lived together.

Mr. Judd denied symptoms of depression and free-floating anxiety. He said that he had never experimented with cigarettes or alcohol, adding, “I wouldn’t want to feel like I was out of control.” He denied a family history of mental illness. He was raised in a two-parent household and was an above-average high school and college student. He was an only child and first shared a room as a college freshman. He described that experience as being difficult due to “conflicting styles—he was a mess and I knew that things should be kept neat.” He had moved mid-year into a single dorm room and had not lived with anyone until Mr. Kleinman moved in. Mr. Judd was well liked by his boss, earning recognition as “employee of the month” three times in 2 years. Feedback from colleagues and subordinates was less enthusiastic, indicating that he was a micromanager on shared projects, and often critical of his colleagues’ efforts. Also, it seemed he had a reputation as a bore, stemming from a happy hour trivia night in which he had repeatedly questioned the answers his coworkers provided.

On examination, Mr. Judd was a thin man with eyeglasses and gelled hair, sitting on a couch next to his boyfriend. He was meticulously dressed. He was cooperative with the interview and sat quietly while his boyfriend spoke, interrupting on a few occasions to contradict. His speech was normal in rate and tone. His affect was irritable. There was no evidence of depression. He denied specific phobias and did not think he had ever experienced a panic attack. At the end of the consultation, Mr. Judd remarked, “I know I’m difficult, but I really do want this to work out.”",Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder,dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Prioritizing diagnoses**

I need to come up with five diagnoses, focusing on their likelihood rather than just possibilities. First, I’ll note Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD). Second, maybe Hoarding Disorder. Third could be OCD, particularly if it involves ordering or cleaning, though that’s less likely. Fourth, I might consider Generalized Anxiety Disorder or another type of anxiety. Fifth might be Autism Spectrum Disorder or another personality disorder. I’ll have to analyze these carefully to select the most plausible top five.

**Analyzing vignette details**

The vignette describes a long, stressful apartment search due to a busy work schedule. The person refused professional movers, opting to pack everything themselves, which took a week. They have strict rules about item organization and feel anxious about losing important things, leading to clutter. Their perfectionism hampers efficiency, as they work late and wake early to clean and organize, though they deny experiencing depression. They’re recognized as a good student but have mixed perceptions among colleagues due to their micromanagement style.

**Evaluating disorders and criteria**

This seems to fit the criteria for Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD), as there’s a focus on details, perfectionism impacting task completion, and reluctance to discard items. The individual shows signs aligned with Hoarding Disorder, like difficulty getting rid of possessions and distress over discarding, likely resulting in clutter. They're also particularly concerned about losing important things, impacting their living space. I’m unsure if clutter genuinely impairs their living area, but it could be part of OCPD. There are signs of OCD with their organization habits, yet no intrusive thoughts mentioned.

**Analyzing additional disorders**

The individual displays irritability and a controlling nature while denying anxiety, which points more toward OCPD rather than OCD. While OCD remains a plausible option, it seems less likely. There's a fear of losing important items, indicating some anxiety, but it’s not typical of Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) could be considered due to his need for control and rigid patterns, but there aren't enough indications of restricted interests or sensory issues. Overall, OCPD appears to be the most fitting diagnosis for now.

**Listing potential diagnoses**

I’ve been considering potential diagnoses, weighing OCPD, Hoarding Disorder, and other anxiety-related issues. The first is Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD) because of the individual's perfectionism and controlling behavior. Hoarding Disorder could also apply due to their fear of discarding important items. I’m considering Generalized Anxiety Disorder or other anxiety-related disorders as possibilities, but they seem less likely based on their denial of anxiety. Here's the structured list of the top five diagnoses:

180,"Raven Lundquist (she/her, preferring Raven) was a 24-year-old graduate student in philosophy who presented for a psychiatric evaluation at her brother’s insistence. The two siblings lived together, and the brother threatened to withhold her allowance from a small trust if she didn’t get “some help.”

Raven explained that her brother was worried about her being “sadomasochistic.” In public, he might just say that he was worried that she was an alcoholic and out of control, but she thought he just didn’t like her interest in “BDSM” (bondage, domination/discipline, sadism/submission, and masochism).

She said that she had been in a relationship with Lilly for about a year. The two of them self-identified as queer, a label they found less stigmatizing than “lesbian.” One evening, after an evening of drinking with her brother, Raven told him that she and Lilly enjoyed going to bondage parties, where they would role-play “mistress-slave scenes” in which they would wear tight leather clothing and high heels, and Lilly would whip Raven and call her derogatory or humiliating names. Raven was fine with being seen as a masochist in public, but in private, she generally enjoyed being in charge.

Raven asked the psychiatrist whether he was “the kind of shrink who pathologizes everything? Surely, you’re not like my brother, who gets squeamish about anything related to kink. But that’s his problem, right doctor? Don’t you agree that his concerns are just homophobia?” She asked whether the psychiatrist had read Justine by the Marquis de Sade, “which isn’t as well written as Lolita, but it strikes a chord. By the way, Lilly laughs at my reading choices, calling me an ‘old-school perv.’ ”

On questioning about other BDSM activities, Raven said she sometimes drugged Lilly without Lilly’s knowledge. She found the sense of control to be extremely sexually exciting. Raven said she did not think Lilly would mind if she found out, given that Lilly identified as a sadomasochist and would often let Raven tie her up. Raven admitted that she had secretly drugged previous sexual partners, but that only one had complained about it, and “only when she found photos on my camera.” That lover had broken off the relationship immediately and claimed that she would have gone to the police if the “photos weren’t so embarrassing.”

When asked about her brother’s concern about her alcohol use, Raven immediately said she did “no illegal drugs, no tobacco, not even weed.” Upon further questioning, she did say she might have an alcohol problem. She said she often planned to have a single drink but generally ended up getting significantly intoxicated. She generally got along well with Lilly and her brother, but they often got into verbal fights after everyone had “become really drunk.” She said she often enjoyed her “binges,” with the only problem being that she often missed early morning classes because of hangovers. She had no criminal history.

Raven’s childhood history was notable for having been abandoned by their mother while young. She and her brother had lived with relatives and in foster homes before they had been adopted by a woman whom she referred to as our “intrusive but well-meaning pseudo-mother.” That woman had died the year before, leaving behind a small trust fund for the two of them. Raven had memory gaps from her childhood and thought she might have been sexually molested. “The abuse narrative would make sense, wouldn’t it? But I really don’t remember.” Raven’s medical history was pertinent for having had scoliosis; as a child, she was treated with insertion of a Harrington rod and an extended hospitalization.

Raven described sexual attraction to both men and women but preferred women because “they are typically more submissive.” When she masturbated, and when she drugged sexual partners, she fantasized about “power and control,” particularly about molesting unwilling partners.

She said she felt calm when in sexual control, and when intoxicated, but that she otherwise felt “pretty anxious.” Previous psychiatrists had diagnosed her with generalized anxiety disorder, for which she had been prescribed a benzodiazepine; these were also the medications she used to drug sexual partners.

Raven said she sometimes felt down and depressed but did not think she had ever had a “clinical depression.” While often anxious, she denied ever having phobias or panic. She denied ever feeling suicidal but had sometimes thought about killing the drugged sexual partners, which, “as you surely know, I would never actually do.” She denied obsessions, compulsions, delusions, and hallucinations. She was intelligent and cognitively intact.","1. Sexual sadism disorder

3. Generalized anxiety disorder (provisional)",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Assessing anxiety diagnoses**

I’m considering how to approach the diagnosis of GAD based on the DSM-5-TR criteria, which requires at least six months of excessive anxiety along with three symptoms. Since we can't confirm that, maybe we should use ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" instead. However, the prompt wants a structured list without reasoning. Although it's tricky because we've seen a previous diagnosis of GAD, I feel we can still suggest it as a possible diagnosis while noting the uncertainty.

**Evaluating diagnoses options**

I'm considering including ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" due to incomplete data, as it might be more fitting. The criteria aren't fully met, but we need five diagnoses. The user mentioned benzodiazepine misuse, which could point to ""Other (or unspecified) substance-related disorder."" There might be possibilities like ""binge drinking"" for AUD as well. I'm thinking of including a range of disorders like paraphilic, alcohol use, anxiety, and personality disorders. Also, perhaps ""Unspecified dissociative disorder"" might fit due to memory gaps, even if the symptoms aren’t clear.

**Considering dissociative symptoms**

I'm evaluating the possibility of dissociative amnesia based on her memory gaps from childhood. While these gaps are concerning, it's not clear if they're more than ordinary forgetting. She mentioned potential abuse, which could hint at dissociative amnesia, but I lack strong evidence of significant memory loss typically associated with trauma. There’s no clear indication of other dissociative symptoms, just the memory gaps. I see she’s cognitively intact, but I still need to rank my top five possible diagnoses.

**Considering potential diagnoses**

I'm outlining my top five possible diagnoses and weighing the inclusion of Alcohol Use Disorder as mild, anxiety disorders, and sexual disorders. I’m wondering if Sexual Sadism Disorder is distinct from other paraphilic disorders. There might be some overlap, so I could consider listing one as primary and the other as a differential. While fantasies suggest some aspects of sadism, I can’t confirm them. I should be cautious as I define these conditions while considering the DSM-5-TR guidelines.

**Determining diagnoses hierarchy**

I’m considering ""Sexual masochism disorder"" since she enjoys being whipped, but it’s consensual, which complicates the diagnosis. The criteria for this disorder involve significant distress and nonconsent, which she doesn't seem to meet. I should think about ""Other specified paraphilic disorder"" for her sexual behaviors. Her history with alcohol and anxiety needs consideration too, but her anxiety may predate any substance use. Her problematic behaviors, like drugging a partner, suggest serious underlying issues that could meet criteria for a paraphilic disorder.

I'm evaluating the sexual behaviors of the individual, particularly related to nonconsenting partners and drugging. This raises concerns about ""Other specified paraphilic disorder (sexually coercive)"". While some elements suggest sexual sadism, her primary arousal seems to stem from control and coercion rather than suffering. 

I also need to consider her alcohol use and anxiety, leading to potential ""Generalized anxiety disorder"". The manipulative traits suggest ""Other specified personality disorder (antisocial traits)"" as a plausible diagnosis as well. So, I need to finalize the top five diagnoses with their F-codes for clarity.

I'm considering various diagnoses based on the information provided. The primary diagnosis seems to be ""Other specified paraphilic disorder (sexually coercive)"" since it captures the coercive behaviors. For secondary diagnoses, I could include ""Alcohol use disorder, mild"" due to her drinking patterns. Other possibilities are ""Generalized anxiety disorder"" or ""Unspecified anxiety disorder."" I also might include ""Sexual sadism disorder,"" although it could overlap with paraphilic disorder. 

Here's the structured list with ICD-10 codes:

1. Other specified paraphilic disorder (sexually coercive) - F65.89

181,"Terry Najarian, a 65-year-old salesman for a large corporation, presented for a psychiatric evaluation after his wife threatened to leave him. Although he said he was embarrassed to discuss his issues with a stranger, he described his sexual interest in women’s undergarments in a quite matter-of-fact manner. This interest had surfaced several years earlier and had not been a problem until he was caught masturbating by his wife 6 weeks prior to the evaluation. Upon seeing him dressed in panties and a bra, she initially “went nuts,” thinking he was having an affair. After he clarified that he was not seeing anyone else, she “shut him out” and hardly spoke to him. When they argued, she called him a “pervert” and made it clear that she was considering divorce unless he “got help.”

Mr. Najarian’s habit began in the setting of his wife’s severe arthritis and likely depression, both of which significantly reduced her overall activity level and specifically her interest in sex. His “fetish” was the bright spot during his frequent and otherwise dreary business trips. He also masturbated at home but generally waited until his wife was out of the house. His specific pattern was to masturbate about twice weekly, using bras and panties that he had collected over several years. He said that intercourse with his wife had faded to “every month or two” but was mutually satisfying.

The patient had been married for over 30 years, and the couple had two grown children. Mr. Najarian had planned to retire comfortably later that year, but not if the two choices were either “to be poor after we split the assets or to sit around the house all day and be called a pervert.”

He became visibly anxious when discussing his marital difficulties. He described some recent difficulty falling asleep and “worried constantly” about his marriage but denied other psychiatric problems. He had made a show of throwing away a half dozen pieces of underwear, which had seemed to reassure his wife, but he had saved his “favorites” and “could always buy more.” He said he was of mixed mind. He did not want to end his marriage, but he saw nothing harmful in his new mode of masturbating. “I’m not unfaithful or doing anything bad,” he said. “It just excites me, and my wife certainly doesn’t want to be having sex a few times a week.”

Mr. Najarian denied any difficulties related to sexual functioning, adding that he could maintain erections and achieve orgasm without women’s undergarments. He recalled being aroused when he touched women’s underwear as a teenager and had masturbated repeatedly to that experience. That fantasy had disappeared when he became sexually active with his wife. He denied any personal or family history of mental illness.",Fetishistic disorder,dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Considering potential diagnoses**

It's okay to rule out some conditions, but the request is for diagnoses. We can still mention less likely options as potential possibilities, avoiding those without any evidence. Only options supported by data should be included. For those less likely, I can justify them implicitly even if they just want a list. 

Looking at this case, it seems likely that he meets the criteria for adjustment disorder due to significant stress from a divorce, evidenced by his worry and sleep disturbance.

**Exploring diagnosis options**

Adjustment disorder could be diagnosed due to clinically significant symptoms, but if his worry seems proportionate, it might not apply. He could also have ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" or just a normative stress reaction. He mentions constant worry and difficulty sleeping, which could be typical. While he appears anxious, it might not reach disorder levels. I’ll consider listing ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" or ""Unspecified anxiety disorder"" as differentials. Other concerns include potential sexual dissatisfaction related to his wife's decreased interest, but that's not diagnostic. There are questions about neurocognitive disorders and other possible anxiety or personality disorders, but his denial of mental illness factors in too.

**Finalizing diagnosis list**

The top five will focus on paraphilic disorders and anxiety. I'm considering:

1. Transvestic disorder (with fetishism) - F65.1
2. Adjustment disorder with anxiety - F43.22
3. Fetishistic disorder - F65.0
4. Unspecified anxiety disorder - F41.9
5. Insomnia disorder - F51.01 (or possibly other specified insomnia disorder F51.09).

He has trouble falling asleep, which could indicate insomnia symptoms, but it's not chronic. I need to verify the DSM-5-TR codes for insomnia disorders. The primary code for insomnia disorder is F51.01, while G47.00 covers insomnia due to medical conditions.

**Clarifying disorder codes**

I can use F51.01 for insomnia disorder since it qualifies under the DSM. While I could also consider including ""Generalized Anxiety Disorder - F41.1,"" he doesn't meet the six-month requirement. Instead, it makes more sense to use ""Other Specified Anxiety Disorder (duration <6 months) - F41.8,"" as this accurately reflects his worry over the past six weeks.

Although we already have adjustment disorder, I wonder if we could include both? However, I’ll stick with F41.8. When it comes to obsessive-compulsive disorders, F42 is for OCD, but it doesn’t seem applicable here either.

**Selecting final diagnoses**

I’m considering a list that includes:

1. Transvestic disorder with fetishism - F65.1
2. Adjustment disorder with anxiety - F43.22
3. Fetishistic disorder - F65.0
4. Other specified anxiety disorder (duration <6 months) - F41.8
5. Insomnia disorder - F51.01

It’s important to ensure these diagnoses correspond to DSM-5-TR. I’m wondering if including both ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" and ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety"" is redundant. They’ve asked for the top five diagnoses, so alternatives can be both possible and mutually exclusive.

As I analyze the vignette, I note his interest in women's undergarments seems central. Though he occasionally cross-dresses, I believe the focus is on his fetishistic interest. Given this context, I’d lean towards ""Transvestic disorder"" as primary, as he has exhibited behavior aligning with that. However, the uncertainty around the differentiation between fetishism and transvestism remains a challenge.

**Defining appropriate diagnoses**

I need to ensure that the diagnoses are written using proper DSM-5-TR terminology. For paraphilic disorders, I would categorize it as ""Fetishistic Disorder."" The codes I need to remember are F43.22 for adjustment disorder with anxiety, F41.1 for generalized anxiety disorder, and others. The case involves a man with a sexual interest in women's undergarments. His behavior suggests a possible transvestic disorder, as he was caught cross-dressing. The distinction between fetishistic and transvestic disorders is subtle but crucial, particularly regarding the arousal source. 

So, primary diagnosis should likely be ""Transvestic Disorder (with fetishism)"" because of the behaviors indicated.

**Finalizing the diagnosis list**

I need to define the top five diagnostic codes. Primarily, I’ll list ""Transvestic disorder (with fetishism)"" as F65.1 based on the narrative, followed by ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety"" (F43.22). For the next three, I can include ""Fetishistic disorder"" (F65.0), ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" (F41.8), and ""Insomnia disorder"" (F51.01). Though adjustment and other specified anxiety may seem redundant, they capture different aspects of the case. I need to ensure all codes are correct and structured appropriately without additional reasoning.

**Crafting the diagnosis list**

I'm working to finalize the list of diagnoses based on the vignette. The top diagnosis should be ""Transvestic disorder (with fetishism)"" as F65.1. Next, I'll include ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety"" (F43.22) and ""Fetishistic disorder"" (F65.0) as the third. For the fourth, I'll choose ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" (F41.8), and finally, I'll add ""Insomnia disorder"" (F51.01). This gives a well-rounded list, ensuring each diagnosis has the appropriate code. It's crucial to stay within the requested framework!

**Formatting the diagnosis list**

I've compiled my diagnoses, making sure to stay clear and precise. I've listed ""Transvestic disorder, with fetishism"" as F65.1, followed by ""Adjustment disorder with anxiety"" (F43.22), ""Fetishistic disorder"" (F65.0), ""Other specified anxiety disorder"" (F41.8), and finally, ""Insomnia disorder"" (F51.01). It's important to present these without any extraneous punctuation, ensuring it's formatted just as requested. I hope this meets the user's needs as intended!","1.

182,"Vance Orren was a 28-year-old self-reported cisgender heterosexual man who was arrested after pushing a stranger in front of an oncoming subway train. He told police that he believed the man was going to “tell everyone that I was a faggot” and that he, Mr. Orren, was trying to protect himself from the “homosexual conspiracy.”

Mr. Orren had a history of a psychotic disorder, a cocaine use disorder, and nonadherence to medication and psychotherapy at the time of the incident. He was unemployed. In court, Mr. Orren entered a plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease (the “insanity defense”) and underwent a full psychiatric evaluation, including assessment of his sexual history and desires.

As part of his legal case, Mr. Orren underwent a structured sex offender evaluation. He reported that his first sexual contact was at age 12, when his uncle and an 18-year-old male cousin “did things” to him while he was in foster care. They would take him to McDonald’s afterward, “so it was fine.” By the time he was 14 or 15, he was regularly having sex with males and females who ranged in age “from about ten to in their thirties.”

He was unable to answer whether the sexual contact was always consensual, saying, “No one ever called the cops.” As an adult, he said that he preferred having sex with “young girls, because they don’t fight much.” He said that he usually only had sex with adults when he hired prostitutes or prostituted himself in exchange for money or drugs, although he said that sometimes when high, he “might have done stuff that I don’t really remember.”

The structured sex offender evaluation included penile plethysmography, assessment of visual reaction time using Viewing Time (a measure of the amount of time a person looks at a particular photo or other visual representation of a sexually stimulating situation), and a detailed interview about his sexual practices. This evaluation concluded that his main sexual attraction was to girls between the ages of 8 and 13 years.

Mr. Orren’s personal history was significant for multiple childhood disruptions that led to his moving into the foster care system at age 7. At age 9, his first foster mother caught him repeatedly stealing toys and bullying other children. When she reprimanded him, he hit her with a brick, knocking her unconscious. That led to placement in a second foster home. He began using drugs and alcohol at age 11. He was first incarcerated at 13, for shoplifting from an electronics store in order to obtain money for marijuana. At that point, he went back to live with his maternal grandmother, who has episodically provided him a home since then. During those 15 years, he has been arrested at least a dozen times, mostly for drug possession.

Mr. Orren stopped attending school in eighth grade, at about the same time that he was admitted to his first psychiatric inpatient unit. That admission was triggered by his beating his head against a wall “to stop the voices.” He was given a DSM-IV diagnosis of psychosis not otherwise specified, treated with risperidone, and discharged after 1 week. Soon after discharge, he discontinued the antipsychotic medication.

Between the ages of 15 and 28, Mr. Orren regularly abused cocaine and alcohol and often used other substances when they were available. By the time of his arrest, he had had at least seven psychiatric admissions, always for auditory hallucinations and persecutory delusions (usually of a sexual nature). It was not clear which substances he was using prior to and during these episodes of psychosis or whether they were implicated in the development of his psychiatric symptoms. He had also been admitted twice for alcohol detoxification after he went into withdrawal while unable to acquire alcohol. He was consistently nonadherent to any type of outpatient treatment. He maintained sobriety only while in hospitals or jails. When contacted by the consulting psychiatrist, his grandmother pointed out that Mr. Orren had always been “reckless, dishonest, and angry. I don’t think I’ve ever heard him apologize. I love him, but he probably belongs in jail for lots of reasons.”","1. Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder
2. Cocaine use disorder
3. Alcohol use disorder
4. Antisocial personality disorder
5. Pedophilic disorder, nonexclusive type, sexually attracted to both",dsm_5_tr_clinical_cases,"**Prioritizing diagnoses**

I need to identify the top five diagnoses, prioritizing the one that best explains psychosis and violence — likely schizophrenia or substance-induced psychotic disorder. We have to consider the patient's history, including chronicity, early onset, and recurrent episodes, but substance use complicates things. This evaluation might take place in court since he pleads insanity. He pushed a stranger due to paranoid delusions while being nonadherent to medication, raising questions about his substance use during multiple psychiatric admissions.

**Analyzing diagnosis options**

I’m looking at the duration of continuous symptoms for at least six months, including one month of active-phase symptoms. The history of psychosis since adolescence and multiple hospitalizations could suggest a potential diagnosis. While we need to avoid assumptions, it feels safe to consider ""Schizophrenia,"" especially given the chronic psychotic disorder with auditory hallucinations and persecutory delusions. However, previous mentions point to unspecified psychotic disorder. I might lean toward ""Other specified schizophrenia spectrum"" or ""Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum,"" but I need to weigh the impact of substance use on the diagnosis.

**Considering psychosis factors**

It’s notable that he was admitted around age 13-14 due to banging his head against the wall, which suggests he experienced auditory hallucinations early on. He began using drugs and alcohol at age 11, raising the question of whether early psychosis might be substance-induced from cannabis or other substances. While cannabis can trigger psychosis, his episodes consistently involve sexual persecutory delusions and auditory hallucinations. The specific incident of paranoia regarding a conspiracy about his sexuality might indicate schizophrenia or could relate to stimulant-induced psychosis.

**Evaluating long-term symptoms**

He’s had episodes over many years involving various substances, but it's unclear if his symptoms persist during sobriety. He spent time in jails and hospitals, presumably sober, but we don't know if he experienced psychosis during those times. With at least seven psychiatric admissions, he might have been treated with antipsychotics, leading to improvement. Given his diagnosis of psychosis NOS and nonadherence to treatment, it seems plausible to label him under ""Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders"" since there's a long duration of symptoms.

**Summarizing possible diagnoses**

I need to clarify which substances could have contributed to his psychiatric symptoms, making it difficult to determine if his psychosis is substance-induced or primary. Given this uncertainty, potential diagnoses include ""Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder"" or ""Substance-induced psychotic disorder."" In my top five, I’ll list both schizophrenia and substance-induced psychotic disorder, along with alcohol use disorder, cocaine use disorder, and antisocial personality disorder. I’ll ensure the ICD-10 codes correspond accurately: F20.9, F10.20, F14.20, F65.4, and F60.2.
