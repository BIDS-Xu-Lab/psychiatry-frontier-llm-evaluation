    "vignette":"A black male in his early 20s with a remote history of depression as an adolescent and current cannabis use presented following an assault while incarcerated. He was found unconscious with mental status changes and brought to the hospital. Initial examination and work-up revealed right-sided periorbital edema and ecchymosis. The patient was arousable to noxious stimuli but would quickly return to sleep and was not interactive during multiple examination attempts. The emergency department staff believed there was a volitional component to his lack of participation in the exam, as he would push away from providers as they examined him or lie unresponsive. At one point, the patient was able to ambulate briefly while in the emergency department (although he ran into several objects) and tolerated an oral intake challenge with juice. Over the course of 5 days, the patient was returned to the emergency department by the facility four more times due to concerns that his mental status was not improving. The facility reported the patient was unable to attend to his ADLs. He was seen to be withdrawn, not eating or drinking, and toileting on himself or the floor. Additionally, guards (as he was incarcerated for part of his hospital admission) reported that he would occasionally speak to family members and staff. However, when he was offered paperwork to sign himself out of jail with an ankle monitor, he only gazed at the officer without speaking.\n\nUrine toxicology was positive for THC and a negative blood alcohol level. He was found to have ketones consistent with starvation ketosis. Lumbar puncture revealed CSF cell count with six total nucleated cells present, <2,000 RBC, 54\u2009mg\/dL glucose, and 39\u2009mg\/dL protein. Meningitis\/encephalitis panel for 14 common viral and bacterial pathogens and antibody testing for West Nile Virus was negative. CT of the head showed no fractures of the face\/vertebra and was negative for other acute findings. EEG was read as consistent with a normal drowsy state. MRI of the brain, both with and without contrast, showed a cerebellar developmental venous anomaly but no acute findings. A neurology consult was obtained. His neurologic exam was noted to be variable, with poor participation despite repeated prompting, making full examination difficult. He responded to pain equally in all extremities, demonstrated no abnormal movements, had 2+ reflexes symmetrically, and normal pupillary response. Neurology ultimately felt that his LP, MRI, and EEG were unremarkable, and his symptomatology could be explained by postconcussive symptoms.\n\nOnce the patient was admitted, he was initially treated with a trial of Modafinil for suspected postconcussive syndrome, to which there was no response. On Day 6 of his hospitalization, when the psychiatric consultation service reconsidered his disordered behavior, psychomotor retardation, and speech with consideration for the presence of catatonia, the question of \u201cvolitional\u201d inactivity took on a new meaning. There were numerous catatonia signs present to variable degrees: mutism, decreased oral intake, negativism, withdrawal, and decreased spontaneous movement. No automatic obedience, ambitendency, or rigidity was appreciated. ",

    "model_thoughts":"Hmm, this is a complex clinical case requiring careful analysis. The patient presents with a mix of neurological and psychiatric symptoms following an assault while incarcerated. Let me break down the key information systematically.\n\nFirst, the patient has a history of adolescent depression and current cannabis use. The assault led to periorbital injuries, but imaging shows no acute intracranial findings. The puzzling part is his fluctuating mental status - periods of unresponsiveness alternating with brief ambulation and pushing away during exams. The urine toxicology shows THC but no alcohol, and ketones indicate starvation.\n\nThe neurological workup is largely unremarkable: normal EEG, MRI showing only a venous anomaly, and non-diagnostic lumbar puncture. Neurology initially considered postconcussive syndrome, but modafinil failed. The turning point comes on day 6 when psychiatry notes possible catatonia signs: mutism, negativism, withdrawal, and reduced movement.\n\nGiven the context - assault, incarceration stress, prior depression - this seems like a psychiatric decompensation. The catatonia features are prominent, but we need to consider what's driving it. The cannabis use could be relevant, and the remote depression history suggests mood disorder vulnerability. The lack of response to modafinil and absence of neurological findings make primary psychiatric conditions more likely.\n\nFor differential diagnosis, catatonic disorder due to another medical condition should be ruled out first given the head trauma, but the workup was negative. Substance-induced seems possible with THC positivity. The withdrawal and mutism in an incarcerated setting could also point to acute stress or trauma disorders. The primary diagnosis should capture the most immediate concern - the catatonia - while secondary diagnoses account for underlying factors.",

    "vignette":"A 12-year-old male with no specific birth or medical history became concerned about lower abdominal distention and began reducing his food intake 3 months prior to consultation. He exercised obsessively according to his food intake. Although he was considerably losing weight, he commented that his belly was fat and did not want it to get any fatter. Body image disturbances and anxiety regarding being overweight were observed. During his initial consultation, he was very lean, with a body mass index (BMI) of 11.5\u2009kg\/m2. He also had sinus bradycardia with a heart rate of approximately 40\u2009beats\/min. We attempted to improve his weight with enteral nutritional supplements while identifying underlying diseases by head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and abdominal ultrasound.

    "vignette":"We report on a 35-year-old female with a history of schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, and cocaine use disorder, with multiple previous psychiatric admissions, who was brought to our hospital's crisis unit after her parents called police, complaining that she had become aggressive and was \u201cacting delusional\u201d during an argument. According to her parents, the patient had demanded a DNA test to prove that her parents were not her biological parents and that her son was not her biological son. One week prior to admission, the patient's parents had reported her missing when she \u201cdisappeared\u201d from their home soon after being discharged from our hospital following a similar presentation. Prior to admission, the patient's medications included lamotrigine, clonazepam, and long-acting injectable aripiprazole; however, her adherence to treatment recommendations was poor.\n\nAlthough her parents claimed that she resided with them and her 2-year-old son, the patient endorsed a recent history of homelessness lasting several months. The patient said that during this period of homelessness, she had been sexually assaulted by a stranger in his hotel room. Collateral revealed that per court order, the patient's continued custody of her son was contingent on her adherence to psychotropic medications and inpatient drug rehabilitation. The patient admitted to using recreational drugs frequently over the past 6 months, including crack cocaine, which she stated she had used during the 1-week interval between hospitalizations.\n\nDuring her initial mental status examination, the patient was poorly groomed, uncooperative, intrusive, and irritable. Her speech was pressured, and she described her recent sleep as poor. She commented that she intended to become pregnant and to sell the baby to an agency for $6,000. She made religious statements about \u201cbeing fruitful and multiplying\u201d and admitted to recently engaging in hypersexual behavior, explaining that \u201cI have boyfriends on the streets.\u201d She underwent testing for sexually transmitted infections, with reassuring results. She declined voluntary inpatient psychiatric admission and was subsequently screened and committed. We discontinued clonazepam at the time of admission, and we restarted the patient on lamotrigine, adding oral aripiprazole to supplement her long-acting injectable aripiprazole.\n\nDuring her hospitalization, the patient faced several barriers to efficient psychiatric stabilization. First among these was her insistence on refusing any medications that might cause weight gain, including olanzapine. She endorsed allergies to haloperidol, risperidone, lurasidone, and lithium, with symptoms such as \u201canxiety,\u201d \u201ceye rolling,\u201d and \u201cfacial twitching\u201d in response to these drugs. Because she was adherent to oral lamotrigine and aripiprazole, we chose not to seek treatment over objection to administer a stronger antipsychotic medication that would also serve as an effective mood stabilizer. On hospital Day 4, the patient appeared virtually in family court, where she received an ultimatum to cooperate with treatment recommendations in order to maintain custody of her son. Nonetheless, she remained adamant about not being placed on \u201cweight gainers,\u201d stating that \u201cI can have nine more babies. I want to be sexy.\u201d On hospital Day 6, she tested positive for COVID-19 and was quarantined for 10 days on a medical floor. Her respiratory symptoms included cough and rhinorrhea, and she continued to display manic symptoms, including elated affect, hyperverbality, grandiosity, religious preoccupation, and inappropriate laughter. She exhibited behaviors suggestive of sexual preoccupation, such as raising her shirt during interviews to reveal a protuberant abdomen and repeatedly endorsing a desire to \u201cstay sexy.\u201d\n\nAfter her quarantine, the patient returned to the psychiatric unit with her manic symptoms unresolved. On hospital Day 17, she requested a pregnancy test due to concerns that she might have become pregnant because she \u201chad sex with a bunch of guys because I was homeless.\u201d The patient seemed reassured when we explained that her admission pregnancy test was negative. We ordered a new quantitative \u03b2-hCG test, which was likewise negative. On Day 18, the patient received a maintenance dose of long-acting injectable aripiprazole. On Day 19, she complained of abdominal and back pain, stating \u201cI've been in labor since last night.\u201d She elaborated that \u201cI can feel the head in my crotch\u201d and \u201cwhen I lay on my back, I feel the little hands and feet.\u201d She also stated that her \u201cwater broke\u201d and her \u201cmucus plug broke.\u201d The patient exhibited several physical signs and symptoms of pregnancy, including a distended abdomen, intermittent \u201cpulsating\u201d bilateral lower abdominal cramps, and sensations of fetal movement. In addition, she endorsed amenorrhea for the past year, except for some \u201cmild spotting\u201d three weeks previously. Convinced that her two recent pregnancy tests were \u201cfalse negatives\u201d and frustrated that members of the treatment team did not believe she was pregnant, she threatened to sue the hospital for failing to provide obstetric care. The patient lamented that \u201cyou all think I'm crazy, but I'm actually pregnant.\u201d At this time, she displayed an intensifying religious preoccupation and stated that she was able to communicate with angels and \u201csee Jesus.\u201d She proclaimed that she herself was a prophet who could interpret the \u201cauras\u201d of hospital staff.\n\nThe patient agreed to a pelvic exam, which revealed a distended, nontender abdomen. The uterus was nongravid. The patient received acetaminophen and heating pads, and we ordered a transabdominal ultrasound to better assess the etiology of her abdominal pain and in the hopes of resolving her condition via additional evidence of nonpregnancy. At this time, the patient began to refuse all previously prescribed medications because she believed these would harm her \u201cbaby.\u201d She did, however, agree to begin fluphenazine elixir, which we prescribed to address worsening psychosis.\n\nWhen she arrived in the ultrasound suite, the patient offered the radiology technologist four million dollars \u201cif you get this baby right.\u201d She became euphoric while viewing the ultrasound monitor, exclaiming \u201cThat's a head, and that's a penis!\u201d Her speech was pressured, and she perseverated on religious themes, requesting that all non-Christian staff leave the suite and instructing staff to \u201cresist the Devil and he will flee from you!\u201d She also demonstrated sexual preoccupation, recalling an experience in which she had \u201cdanced after I had sex\u201d and exclaiming about the size of her \u201cbaby's penis,\u201d predicting that he would be \u201csexy like his daddy.\u201d After the procedure, the patient happily told fellow patients that she would soon deliver another child. She said, \u201cI have been having contractions for 19\u2009hr. When the results come back and they find out I am not crazy, they will finally send me to maternity.\u201d\n\nAn on-call psychiatry resident presented the radiology report to the patient on hospital Day 20. She emphatically refuted the report, articulating a persecutory delusion of a conspiracy waged against her by the treatment team. She stated that the radiologist must have been \u201cpaid off\u201d to switch her ultrasound with that of another patient. She continued to refuse medications that she felt might harm her \u201cbaby\u201d; however, she agreed to an increase in her dose of fluphenazine. Following this dose increase, her affect remained labile, with frequent swings between euphoria and irritability, but she ceased making comments indicative of religious and sexual preoccupation. As our hospital is a short-term care facility, we decided to refer the patient to a higher level of care facility. On the day of her discharge, the patient told a nurse that \u201cI don't think I'm pregnant anymore; it's all the shit I have inside me,\u201d referring to her constipated bowels.",

    "model_thoughts":"Hmm, this is a complex clinical case requiring careful analysis. The patient has a known history of schizoaffective disorder and cocaine use disorder, but the current presentation suggests an acute exacerbation with prominent manic and psychotic features.\n\nThe key symptoms to note are the delusional beliefs about pregnancy despite negative tests and physical exams, religious preoccupation, hypersexual behavior, pressured speech, and irritability. These align with manic episodes in bipolar spectrum disorders. The persistence of psychotic symptoms like delusions alongside mood symptoms points toward schizoaffective disorder.\n\nI need to consider differential diagnoses while keeping in mind the patient's history. Substance-induced psychotic disorder is relevant given her cocaine use, but the symptoms persist beyond intoxication. Schizophrenia is less likely due to the predominant mood symptoms. The pseudocyesis presentation is particularly notable as a somatic delusion within the psychotic disorder framework.\n\nThe diagnosis should reflect both the chronic condition and current acute presentation.

    "vignette":"The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a psychiatric history of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), major depressive disorder (MDD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), dyssomnia, tobacco use disorder, and alcohol use disorder in remission. Her tobacco use disorder began at age 22, and she smoked two packs of cigarettes daily. At age 46, she decreased her tobacco use to smoking one and a half packs of cigarettes daily. Two years later, she further decreased her tobacco use to smoking one pack of cigarettes daily.\n\nHer alcohol use disorder began at age 38, and she drank a pint (473\u2009mL) of hard liquor daily. At age 45, she decreased her alcohol use to half a pint (236.5\u2009mL) of hard liquor daily. The following year, she decreased her alcohol use to only weekends. Two years later, she used alcohol very occasionally. At age 49, her husband passed, and her alcohol use increased to a fifth (750\u2009mL) of gin daily. She was hospitalized twice that year for chronic pancreatitis and quit drinking after the second hospitalization.\n\nShe struggled with worsening GAD, MDD, and PTSD since age 39. At age 46, she was prescribed citalopram but did not tolerate it. At age 49, she began regularly seeing outpatient psychiatry. She was prescribed sertraline and prazosin. A few months later, her MDD and PTSD symptoms significantly improved. However, her GAD worsened, and she had more frequent exacerbations. Her sertraline and prazosin dosages were increased. She was also prescribed hydroxyzine but did not tolerate it. Additionally, she received grief therapy as recommended. Her MDD and PTSD symptoms improved significantly more, but her GAD continued to be uncontrolled. Intermittently, she would be out of her medications, and her MDD and GAD would worsen. Her PTSD was stable, even when out of medication.\n\nAlso, the patient was prescribed melatonin for her dyssomnia at age 50. Her dyssomnia was uncontrolled despite increasing the melatonin dosage. She did not tolerate trazodone. The patient was then lost to follow-up with outpatient psychiatry for 2 years and returned at age 53. Since then, she has had regular follow-up appointments with outpatient psychiatry.\n\nWhen she returned to outpatient psychiatry at age 53, she had been off of all psychiatric medications. Her MDD was partially stable. Her PTSD was stable. Her GAD and dyssomnia were uncontrolled. She had resumed drinking small amounts of alcohol on occasion, about once a month, and she continued to smoke one pack of cigarettes daily. Her sertraline was resumed, and she was started on zolpidem. Her dyssomnia improved with zolpidem. Eventually, her sertraline was switched to paroxetine. After trialing multiple medications, she was started on diazepam for a short period for her uncontrolled anxiety. Psychotherapy was also recommended, but she did not take part in it. In April 2020, at age 55, her outpatient psychiatry appointments were converted from in-person to telehealth due to COVID-19 health regulations.\n\nAt age 49, the patient first noted fatigue and poor memory. At a follow-up appointment a few months later, she continued to report poor memory. A year later, she reported worsening memory, resulting in losing her keys and forgetting important dates. After that, she did not report fatigue or memory concerns for several years.\n\nIn August 2021, at age 56, the patient had mild COVID-19, which did not require hospitalization. Since then, for a period of over 1.5 years, she has reported persistent symptoms associated with LC-19. At her following appointment in December 2021, she noted fatigue, breathlessness, ageusia, poor appetite, weight loss, and \u201cnot feeling right.\u201d In January 2022, she also reported poor memory, increased confusion, and being easily distracted. She was concerned she had an unnoticed stroke that was causing these symptoms. In February 2022, these symptoms persisted, and she reported left-side weakness. In April 2022, she also reported anosmia, \u201cbrain fog,\u201d and feeling disorganized. She stated she could not describe her cognitive symptoms with words. In August 2022, she also reported generalized weakness, loss of balance, dizziness, body temperature changes, and increased disorganization. She stated she couldn't go to walk-in psychotherapy due to her disorganization.\n\nAt this time, she also began experiencing significant impairments in her daily functioning. She reported difficulties with instrumental activities of daily living, such as cooking. In September 2022, she also reported trouble with word finding. In October 2022, she also reported concern regarding her sensation of touch and vision. She reported that things felt different, and she thought her vision \u201ceasily missed things.\u201d For example, she would not have initially seen a trash bag and would suddenly notice it was there. In January 2023, she also expressed feeling unable to drive, although once she was in the car, she could complete the task. In March 2023, she noted not being able to feel her left hand and believed she may have had a stroke to cause this. Other than fatigue and difficulty with memory, the patient did not express any of these symptoms or concerns prior to August 2021.\n\nHer social isolation, due to her symptoms, further exacerbated her distress. She reported excessive anxiety regarding the uncertain etiology of her symptoms. She frequently expressed concern that her physicians were not doing enough to diagnose and treat her. She requested a comprehensive work-up and hospital admission. She did not meet the criteria for hospital admission and was not admitted.",

These are classic physiological symptoms of social anxiety disorder. The chronic course since adolescence supports this as a primary condition.\n\nThe depressive symptoms - low self-esteem, worthlessness, passive death wish - could represent either major depressive disorder or persistent depressive disorder given their enduring nature. However, they might also be secondary to the chronic social impairment.\n\nThe substance use disorder is clearly present given the pattern of polysubstance abuse over 2 years, progressing from marijuana\/alcohol to cocaine and prescription drugs. This needs to be specified as severe given the multiple substances involved.\n\nThe paranoid features - feeling watched and laughed at - could be part of the social anxiety or suggest a separate paranoid personality disorder, especially given the early onset and pervasive pattern. The childhood trauma history and family dysfunction provide context for personality development.\n\nThe panic attacks described appear situationally bound to social situations rather than spontaneous, making panic disorder less likely. The \"medical substance\" misuse of Lyrica might be self-medication for anxiety symptoms.\n\nFor the differential, social anxiety disorder seems most prominent given the early onset, specific triggers, and physiological symptoms.

The Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) score of the patient was 30, indicating severe alcohol dependence. He had delirium tremens twice in the last 4 years. In the past, abstinence was prompted by a cultural factor (mourning of a brother) and a physical factor (pancreatitis). This time, the reason for abstinence was the COVID-19 lockdown. Following the lockdown, the patient was forced to stop alcohol due to its unavailability and inaccessibility. Due to movement constraints, family members had trouble getting treatment during the early withdrawal period. After three days of abstinence, the patient started having symptoms of agitation, decreased sleep, tremors of the hand and body, decreased awareness of the surroundings, visual hallucinations, and was hearing frightening voices. While having these symptoms, the patient tried to jump from the house (but was stopped by family members) and later inflicted a cut injury over the neck with a kitchen knife, stating that it was better to die on own than to die from others. A 3\u22171\u2009cm horizontal laceration in the anterior neck was sustained.\n\nHe was rushed to Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital (TUTH) for an emergency. He was attended by the emergency, otorhinolaryngology, and psychiatry teams. The mental status examination (MSE) at admission showed that the patient had psychomotor agitation, sweating, tremors of both hands and body, disorientation to time and place, impaired attention and concentration, impaired immediate recall, and recent memory. The Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment Alcohol Scale Revised (CIWA-AR) score was 45, indicating severe withdrawal.

He was initially evaluated by our child and adolescent psychiatry inpatient consultation service and then later, followed by our inpatient child psychiatry service and our outpatient child psychiatry clinic. The patient and his family provided written and verbal consent for the publication of this case. Identifiable information has been removed from this case report.\n\nThe patient's symptoms began 3 weeks after a confirmed COVID-19 infection. He visited his pediatrician three times over the subsequent month. At the first pediatrics visit, he reported persistent shortness of breath, nasal congestion, and anxiety. His examination was normal, and no laboratory evaluation was reported. He was provided with a prednisone \u201cburst\u201d with 60\u2009mg po for 5 days. He and his family were reassured, and no medical therapy was prescribed. During the second pediatrics visit, he reported worsening anxiety, hopelessness, inattention, poor sleep, and tearfulness. He was started on escitalopram 10\u2009mg daily. At the third visit, his symptoms had progressed further to include distorted thoughts and a fear of being alone, a fear of taking showers, racing thoughts, confusion, and intrusive thoughts. Laboratory evaluation, including a complete blood count (CBC), complete metabolic panel (CMP), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and C-reactive protein (CRP), were all within normal limits. He was continued on escitalopram and referred to counseling.\n\nFive months after his first confirmed infection with COVID-19, he presented to the ED for evaluation of significant worsening of depressive thoughts, suicidal ideation, and thoughts of hurting others. He felt that the thoughts of hurting other people belonged to someone else, describing it as \u201csomeone reaching out to me.\u201d Laboratory evaluations of CBC, CMP, ethanol, and urinalysis drug screen (UDS) were all within normal limits or negative. His evaluation did not support an imminent threat to himself or others, and he was discharged home.\n\nSix months after his first confirmed infection with COVID-19, he returned to his pediatrician twice. He first reported additional neuropsychiatric complaints, including auditory hallucinations, derealization, cognitive slowing, and daily headaches. Laboratory evaluation of CBC, CMP, TSH, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), uric acid, and troponin were all within normal limits. Head computed tomography (CT) did not reveal any abnormalities. He and his family were reassured and encouraged to follow up with psychiatry. He returned to his pediatrician again with complaints of difficulty with thought organization, derealization, and continued cognitive slowing and again was reassured that there was no medical cause for his symptoms.\n\nNine months after his first confirmed infection with COVID-19, he presented to the ED twice within 1 week for worsening symptoms and new episodes of rage, self-injurious behavior, visual and auditory hallucinations, depression and hopelessness, lack of control of thoughts, and transient suicidal ideations. Both visits to the ED included laboratory evaluation of CBC, CMP, ethanol level, and UDS, which were all within normal range or negative. At the first ED visit, he was able to contract for safety and was discharged home. At the second ED visit, he was observed for 5 days. During this time, he did not have any additional episodes of aggression and was discharged home.\n\nNine and a half months after his first confirmed infection with COVID-19, he returned to his pediatrician with complaints of sore throat, nasal congestion, and shortness of breath. His COVID-19 PCR test was positive, indicating that he had an active COVID-19 infection for the second time. He was instructed to quarantine and was reassured that he could follow up in the outpatient setting.\n\nTen months after his first infection with COVID-19 (2 weeks after his confirmed reinfection), he presented to the pediatric ED in a neighboring city. He and his parents reported that following his reinfection with COVID-19, his symptoms worsened significantly, culminating with a self-injurious episode during which he \u201csmashed\u201d his face on the ground. He was transferred and admitted to our pediatric inpatient hospitalist service, at which time child and adolescent psychiatry was consulted. He reported increased severity of the previously described symptoms. He reported intrusive thoughts about violence, thoughts about his sexual orientation (having thoughts that he was homosexual although he reported that he identified as heterosexual), and gender identity, which he found distressing. An extensive workup was unremarkable. His urine drug screen 10 with confirmations was positive for marijuana metabolite of 19\u2009ng\/mL (>5\u2009ng\/mL reference range for positive), to which he reported was due to the mother and patient trying cannabidiol (CBD) oil by mouth to treat his anxiety with reported mild benefit. He remained admitted to the pediatric hospitalist service for a week, during which time provisional diagnoses included psychosis and OCD. He started sertraline daily, olanzapine before bed, and hydroxyzine as needed for anxiety. His symptoms showed minimal improvement.",

He would be confused for a few minutes after gaining consciousness, complain of headaches, and would sleep at times. He had stopped going to school for 4 years and would refuse to visit his relatives because of fear of a seizure episode. He was treated with sodium valproate up to 800\u2009mg for a year, 2 years back with irregular follow-ups.

    "model_thoughts":"Hmm, this is a complex clinical vignette with multiple layers of information. Let me start by extracting and organizing the key details systematically.\n\nFirst, the patient is a 16-year-old boy with a 5-year history of seizure disorder, characterized by focal onset generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The semiology includes aura symptoms like tingling, tinnitus, and fear, followed by motor seizures with impaired consciousness. Importantly, EEG shows epileptiform activity, but MRI and blood work are normal. \n\nHe has psychosocial impairments\u2014stopped school for 4 years and avoids social interactions due to seizure fear. Treatment history includes irregular valproate use, noncompliance, and traditional healer visits. After restarting valproate and optimizing to 900mg, he becomes seizure-free but develops sedation and high valproate levels (76mg\/L). Switching to levetiracetam (LEV) leads to dramatic psychiatric symptoms: restlessness, agitation, persecutory delusions, and auditory hallucinations within days, with elevated BPRS scores.\n\nNow, for diagnostic reasoning. The acute psychotic symptoms emerged immediately after discontinuing valproate and starting levetiracetam. Levetiracetam is known to cause psychiatric adverse effects like psychosis, agitation, and hallucinations, especially in adolescents. This suggests a medication-induced psychosis. However, the seizure disorder itself raises possibilities of psychosis related to epilepsy, such as interictal psychosis or postictal psychosis. Given the temporal link to levetiracetam initiation, medication-induced is most plausible.\n\nPrimary diagnosis should reflect the acute, substance-induced psychotic episode. DSM-5-TR allows for \"medication-induced psychotic disorder\" when symptoms develop during or soon after medication use. Here, levetiracetam is the likely trigger. \n\nSecondary diagnoses must account for the underlying epilepsy. Focal onset generalized tonic-clonic seizures align with unspecified epilepsy (G40.209, but since we need F-codes, conversion to psychiatric equivalents is tricky). Wait, DSM-5-TR lists psychological factors affecting other medical conditions for psychosocial impacts of seizures. But the epilepsy itself isn't a psychiatric diagnosis. \n\nAh, the patient has school avoidance and social isolation due to fear of seizures. This fits with illness anxiety disorder or somatic symptom disorder, but more specifically, adjustment disorder with anxiety given the chronic stress of epilepsy. However, the avoidance is severe and persistent\u2014maybe social anxiety disorder due to medical condition? \n\nGiven the complexity, I'll prioritize: 1) medication-induced psychotic disorder, 2) epilepsy-related psychosis (alternative), 3) adjustment disorder with anxiety, 4) social anxiety disorder due to epilepsy, and 5) rule out interictal personality changes. \n\nNeed to ensure ICD-10 F-codes align. Medication-induced psychosis is F06.2, epilepsy-related psychosis F06.0, adjustment disorder F43.23, social anxiety F40.10, and maybe behavioral syndrome due to epilepsy F07.0. \n\nLet me double-check the vignette for clues about chronic psychiatric issues before levetiracetam. None noted\u2014no prior psychosis, family history, or substance use. So, acute onset post-LEV is key. Also, the BPRS scores highlight hostility and suspiciousness, supporting acute psychosis. \n\nFinal list should prioritize the acute presentation while acknowledging underlying epilepsy-related psychosocial issues.

    "vignette":"X is a 39-year-old female, mother of 2 children with full-time work. X presented to a general practitioner with mild diarrhea, which she initially attributed to a fast-food meal. On the following day, as her diarrhea subsided, she decided to go out shopping, but once at the shops, X thought she and her daughter were in danger, did not feel safe, and decided to return home. When she arrived home, she dropped her phone in the toilet as X believed she was being monitored. Shortly after using the landline, X spoke with her younger sister, who noticed that she had a significant degree of incoherent speech, appeared confused, spoke about bizarre topics, and said things out of character, like making cocaine from sugar. The next day, she was expressing bizarre, sexualized ideas to her sister. Then, X went to the street and banged on car windows, so her sister immediately called emergency services. X was escorted to the emergency department (ED) for further care. At the ED, she was mechanically restrained because she was agitated, disorganized, and threatened to leave the ED. The patient at the time of admission was disoriented as to time and place and was oriented to her sister. She initially calmed down on the persuasion of her sister, however, quickly became verbally aggressive towards the physician and her sister, which according to the informant has rarely been used by the patient. The patient was a housewife with a nonsignificant medical history and a past psychiatric history of moderate depression in remission.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, the user has provided a detailed clinical vignette and expects me to follow a specific rubric for data extraction and diagnostic reasoning. First, I need to assess the patient's presentation carefully. The case describes a 39-year-old female with sudden behavioral changes, including paranoia, incoherent speech, disorientation, and agitation. The symptoms appeared abruptly after a mild gastrointestinal issue, which might be relevant.\n\nLooking at the rubric, I need to extract key information and organize it logically. The patient has no significant psychiatric history except for moderate depression in remission. The acute onset with psychotic features like delusions (being monitored, bizarre ideas) and disorganized behavior points to a primary psychotic disorder or an organic cause. The disorientation to time and place suggests possible delirium, especially given the preceding diarrhea, which could indicate an infection or metabolic imbalance.\n\nNext, considering differential diagnoses, the abrupt onset and fluctuating consciousness lean towards delirium due to a general medical condition. However, the presence of prominent psychotic symptoms without a clear medical etiology might suggest schizophreniaform disorder or brief psychotic disorder. The absence of prior psychotic episodes makes schizophrenia less likely. Substance-induced psychosis is possible but not mentioned. Mood disorders with psychotic features could be considered, but the primary symptoms are psychotic, not affective.\n\nThe user wants a list of five diagnoses with ICD-10 codes. The primary should be the most likely based on the acute, severe presentation with disorientation and agitation. Delirium seems fitting. Then, other psychotic disorders like brief psychotic disorder, schizophreniaform disorder, unspecified psychotic disorder, and major depressive disorder with psychotic features as a secondary consideration. I need to ensure the codes are accurate and the order reflects likelihood.",

    "vignette":"A 62-year-old Chinese man first presented to our hospital in October 2014 for worsening of low mood. At that time, he had just been seen by a private psychiatrist and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Aside from the depressive symptoms, he also manifested with strong nihilistic delusions. He did not have any significant physical health conditions. The patient was subsequently admitted to our hospital as a case of major depressive disorder with psychotic features and treated with mirtazapine 30\u2009mg every night, venlafaxine 150\u2009mg every morning, and risperidone 1\u2009mg every night. During his hospitalization, he also underwent six sessions of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and improved significantly after 2 months on the ward.\n\nUpon discharge, he was maintained on mirtazapine, venlafaxine, and risperidone for 2 years. In 2016, risperidone was discontinued. In 2018, due to his stable mood, venlafaxine was also discontinued, and he was only maintained on mirtazapine 30\u2009mg every night. Over the years, he was continued on mirtazapine with doses fluctuating between 15 and 30\u2009mg daily depending on the stress that he experienced at that time. He did not display any manic or hypomanic symptoms during this long period when he was only on mirtazapine. He managed to resume work as a school cleaner and continued on through the years with no significant issues. He was on 6-monthly follow-ups and had been generally compliant with his antidepressant medication.\n\nThe patient was apparently well until May 2023 when he was 71 years old. He was then brought to our hospital again by his relatives for evaluation after a change in behavior for 2 weeks. The patient was observed to have significant mood swings and was described to be very active and irritable. He was also noted to have started sending messages with grandiose content and overspending his money. He was physically aggressive toward his relatives, prompting them to bring him to our psychiatric emergency room for evaluation. During the consult, the patient's mood was observed to be labile. His thought process was largely goal directed but was noted to be interspersed with tangential and at times incoherent responses. He endorsed a decreased need for sleep, racing thoughts, and grandiose delusions. The patient did not take any illicit drugs and did not have any family history of mental illness. There were also no new medications given to him recently. Due to the acute change in his mental state, he received a comprehensive organic workup where blood examination revealed unremarkable results.",

    "model_thoughts":"Hmm, this is a complex clinical vignette requiring careful analysis. The patient has a long psychiatric history with an initial presentation of major depressive disorder with psychotic features, treated successfully with antidepressants, antipsychotics, and ECT. He remained stable for many years on mirtazapine alone.\n\nThe key turning point is the acute behavioral change in May 2023 at age 71, presenting with classic manic symptoms: mood swings, irritability, grandiosity, overspending, aggression, decreased need for sleep, racing thoughts, and grandiose delusions. The organic workup was negative, ruling out substance-induced or medical causes.\n\nGiven the history of major depression and now a clear manic episode with psychotic features, the primary diagnosis should be bipolar I disorder. The patient meets criteria for a current manic episode, and the prior depressive episode establishes the bipolar pattern. The psychotic features accompany both mood episodes.\n\nFor differentials, major depressive disorder with psychotic features remains relevant given the initial presentation, but the manic episode shifts the primary diagnosis. Delusional disorder could be considered due to persistent grandiose delusions, but these are better explained as part of the mood disorder. Schizoaffective disorder is a possibility given the mood episodes with psychotic symptoms, but the timeline and clear separation of mood and psychotic features lean toward bipolar. Substance\/medication-induced bipolar disorder should be ruled out but seems unlikely given the history.

Collateral information from the father confirmed a diagnosis of ASD that was based on detailed neuropsychological testing in childhood. His home medications included losartan 100\u2009mg daily, famotidine 20\u2009mg daily, and sertraline 50\u2009mg daily. Patient shared that he was started on sertraline for his depressive symptoms 4 days ago, and he had taken his 4th dose that morning. He denied any previous history of antidepressant medication use.

On physical examination, he was noted to have bilateral upper extremity tremors, ocular clonus with lateral eye movement, and inducible clonus in his right ankle. Cranial nerve exams II-XII were normal, and deep tendon reflexes were not commented upon, so it is unclear if they were examined or not. Vital signs are notable for a heart rate of 61, blood pressure of 164\/94, and oxygen saturation of 98% at room air.

    "model_thoughts":"Hmm, this is a complex clinical vignette requiring careful analysis. The patient presents with acute neurological symptoms shortly after starting sertraline, which immediately raises red flags for serotonin syndrome. \n\nThe key findings are bilateral tremors, ocular clonus, inducible ankle clonus, and autonomic instability with elevated blood pressure - all classic signs of serotonin toxicity. The timing correlation with sertraline initiation is particularly telling.\n\nGiven the patient's history of ASD, I need to consider how this might interact with medication sensitivity. The mild hypokalemia could contribute to muscle symptoms but doesn't explain the full constellation of findings. The negative drug screen rules out substance-induced causes.\n\nFor the differential, serotonin syndrome must be primary given the diagnostic certainty. Akathisia and dystonic reaction are important considerations but don't fully account for the clonus and autonomic features. Catatonia could present similarly but lacks other characteristic signs. The anxiety diagnosis accounts for baseline symptoms but not the acute presentation.\n\nThe F-codes need to reflect both the acute condition and underlying diagnoses.

    "vignette":"We present an 18-year-old female with a past medical history of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS), chronic insomnia, and schizophrenia who presented to the outpatient adult neurology office. Her childhood was notable for extensive verbal abuse and neglect from her mother, leading to untreated trauma. Three months prior to this visit, the patient was admitted to an inpatient psychiatric facility due to a 9-month history of persecutory delusions, auditory hallucinations, and blunted affect. She was diagnosed with paranoid-subtype schizophrenia and started on Haloperidol 5\u2009mg twice a day. During her stay at the inpatient facility, she had multiple epileptic episodes; she was diagnosed with epilepsy and prescribed Lamotrigine. She initially started a dose of 25\u2009mg once a day for 2 weeks and gradually increased to 50\u2009mg once a day.\n\nThe patient scheduled the initial appointment for the chief concern of tremor. She described it as bilateral, occurring at rest and with action, and starting days after beginning Haloperidol. She described her schizophrenia as being well-controlled with the haloperidol and found the medication effective. Her vitals were within normal limits. Her physical exam was benign and only significant for akathisia and blunted affect. Specifically, on a neurological exam, she had intact cranial nerves I\u2013XII, no focal sensory deficits, no motor strength deficits, and symmetric 2+\/4+ deep tendon reflexes. Given the context, the tremor was likely an extrapyramidal side effect of Haloperidol. We consulted psychiatry, who recommended either decreasing the dose of haloperidol or switching to a second-generation atypical antipsychotic. The patient preferred to continue taking Haloperidol so we decreased her dose to 3\u2009mg twice a day.\n\nDuring the same visit, the patient expressed concern that her Lamotrogine dose was \u201cnot helping\u201d her seizures. She described her seizures as starting at the age of eight. The seizures usually occurred after stressful situations involving the patient's mother. During the episodes, the patient loses motor control and falls to the ground with bilateral arm and limb shaking. She remains conscious during the episodes. Her uncle, present at the initial visit, described the episodes similarly and relayed that she kept her eyes closed and shook her head throughout the episodes. She did not bite her tongue, express incontinence, or have postictal confusion. Most lasted between \u201c2\u20134 minutes.\u201d\n\nEven with the antiepileptic medication, the seizures continued to occur \u201cevery few weeks.\u201d The patient was never treated for epilepsy before her inpatient stay 6 months ago. Since this visit focused on the patient's tremor, she was scheduled for a follow-up in a week regarding her seizures and told to continue to take the medications and call if she had another episode. She was also prescribed orders to draw routine labs.",

    "model_thoughts":"First, the user is an expert psychiatrist, and I need to diagnose based on the clinical case vignette. I must follow the DSM-5-TR criteria and allow for diagnostic flexibility in rare or complex cases.\n\nThe response should be a structured list of the top 5 most likely diagnoses with corresponding ICD-10 F-codes. Only include psychiatric diagnoses using F-codes, no non-psychiatric ones. The format is:\n\n1. <Primary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n\n2. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n\n3. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n\n4. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n\n5. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n\nI am not to output any clinical reasoning; just the list.\n\nNow, let's extract key information from the vignette:\n\n- Patient: 18-year-old female.\n\n- Past medical history: Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS), chronic insomnia, and schizophrenia.\n\n- Childhood history: Extensive verbal abuse and neglect from mother, leading to untreated trauma.\n\n- Three months prior: Admitted to inpatient psychiatric facility due to a 9-month history of persecutory delusions, auditory hallucinations, and blunted affect. Diagnosed with paranoid-subtype schizophrenia and started on Haloperidol.\n\n- During inpatient stay: Had multiple epileptic episodes; diagnosed with epilepsy and prescribed Lamotrigine.\n\n- Chief concern for this visit: Tremor, bilateral, occurring at rest and with action, starting days after beginning Haloperidol. Schizophrenia is well-controlled with Haloperidol.\n\n- Vitals normal. Physical exam: Benign, with akathisia and blunted affect. Neurological exam: Intact cranial nerves, no focal deficits, symmetric reflexes.\n\n- Tremor likely an extrapyramidal side effect of Haloperidol. Psychiatry recommended decreasing dose or switching to atypical antipsychotic. Patient preferred to continue Haloperidol, so dose decreased to 3 mg twice a day.\n\n- Patient concerned Lamotrigine is not helping seizures. Seizures started at age eight. Occur after stressful situations involving mother. During episodes: loses motor control, falls, bilateral arm and limb shaking, remains conscious. Uncle's description: eyes closed, shakes head, no tongue biting, incontinence, or postictal confusion. Lasts 2-4 minutes.\n\n- Seizures continue every few weeks despite medication. Never treated for epilepsy before inpatient stay.\n\n- Focus of visit was on tremor, so scheduled follow-up for seizures.\n\nBased on this, I need to identify psychiatric diagnoses. The vignette mentions several conditions:\n\n1. Schizophrenia: Diagnosed as paranoid-subtype with persecutory delusions, auditory hallucinations, blunted affect. This is a key psychiatric diagnosis.\n\n2. PANDAS: Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections. This is a condition that can involve OCD and tic disorders, but it's not a standard DSM-5-TR diagnosis. DSM-5-TR might categorize it under \"Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder\" or similar, but PANDAS is more of a specifier or related to OCD. However, the vignette says it's part of past medical history.\n\n3. Chronic insomnia: A sleep disorder, which is psychiatric in DSM-5-TR.\n\n4. Epilepsy: This is a neurological condition, not psychiatric, so I should not include it in the list since it doesn't use an F-code. F-codes are for mental, behavioral, and neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\n5. History of trauma: Verbal abuse and neglect from mother, leading to untreated trauma. This could point to trauma-related disorders like PTSD or adjustment disorders.\n\n6. Seizures described: They occur after stressful situations, patient remains conscious, no tongue biting or incontinence. This sounds like psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES), which are often associated with conversion disorder or other somatic symptom disorders. Given the context of trauma and stress, this is a strong possibility.\n\n7. Medication side effects: Akathisia and tremor from Haloperidol, which are extrapyramidal symptoms, but these are side effects, not primary diagnoses.\n\n8. Blunted affect: Part of schizophrenia.\n\nNow, I need to list the top 5 most likely psychiatric diagnoses. The primary diagnosis should be the most prominent based on the vignette.\n\n- The patient was diagnosed with schizophrenia and is on antipsychotic medication. Schizophrenia seems to be the primary psychiatric condition.\n\n- However, the seizures are a significant concern and might be psychogenic. Since they are described in detail and linked to stress and trauma, a diagnosis related to somatic symptoms or conversion disorder could be primary or secondary.\n\n- PANDAS is mentioned, but it's from childhood. In DSM-5-TR, PANDAS might fall under \"Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders\" with specifier for associated with another medical condition, but it's not a standalone diagnosis. I need to see if there are current symptoms. The vignette doesn't mention current OCD or tic symptoms, so perhaps it's historical.\n\n- Chronic insomnia is present.\n\n- Trauma history suggests a trauma-related disorder.\n\nLet's think about DSM-5-TR diagnoses:\n\n1. Schizophrenia (Paranoid Type): ICD-10 F20.0 for paranoid schizophrenia.\n\n2. For the seizures: They sound like psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. In DSM-5-TR, this could be Conversion Disorder (Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder) with attacks or seizures. ICD-10 F44.5 for conversion disorder with seizures or convulsions.\n\n   - The seizures are triggered by stress, patient remains conscious, and no typical epileptic features. This aligns with conversion disorder.\n\n3. History of trauma: Could be Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder if criteria aren't fully met. But the vignette says \"untreated trauma,\" so it might be PTSD. ICD-10 F43.1 for PTSD.\n\n4. PANDAS: As mentioned, this isn't a direct DSM-5-TR diagnosis. It might be classified under \"Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder\" with specifier, but since no current symptoms are described, perhaps it's not active. However, it's part of history, so I could consider it under \"Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder\" or \"Tic Disorder.\" But to be precise, I should base on current presentation. The vignette doesn't mention ongoing OCD or tics.\n\n5. Chronic insomnia: Insomnia Disorder, ICD-10 F51.01 for primary insomnia, or if due to another condition, it might be coded separately. But chronic insomnia is stated.\n\n6. Medication-induced movement disorders: Akathisia and tremor are side effects, so Medication-Induced Acute Akathisia or Medication-Induced Parkinsonism. These are psychiatric diagnoses in DSM-5-TR under \"Medication-Induced Movement Disorders and Other Adverse Effects of Medication.\" ICD-10 codes like G25.71 for drug-induced tremor, but G25.71 is not an F-code; it's under G codes for neurological disorders. Wait, ICD-10 F codes are for mental and behavioral disorders. Medication-induced movement disorders might have F codes if they are psychiatric in nature. Let's check:\n\n   - In ICD-10, extrapyramidal symptoms from antipsychotics can be coded under F06.8 (Other mental disorders due to brain damage and dysfunction and to physical disease) or more specifically, but I need to use F codes.\n\n   - DSM-5-TR has codes for medication-induced disorders, but ICD-10 equivalents might be in F chapter.\n\n   - For example, Neuroleptic-Induced Parkinsonism is under F06.8 or similar. I should look up standard codes.\n\n   - Perhaps for this exercise, I should stick to common psychiatric diagnoses.\n\nGiven the instruction to include only psychiatric diagnoses with F-codes, I need to ensure all diagnoses are in the F chapter.\n\nList possible psychiatric diagnoses:\n\n- Schizophrenia: F20.0\n\n- Conversion Disorder (Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder): F44.5\n\n- Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder: F43.1\n\n- Insomnia Disorder: F51.01\n\n- For PANDAS: Since it's historical and no current symptoms, it might not be a current diagnosis. But the vignette lists it as past medical history, so perhaps it's still relevant. In DSM-5-TR, if OCD symptoms are present, it could be OCD, but not specified here. Maybe \"Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder\" with reference to PANDAS.\n\n- Medication-induced akathisia: In DSM-5-TR, Medication-Induced Acute Akathisia is under \"Medication-Induced Movement Disorders,\" ICD-10 code might be G25.71, but that's not an F-code. I think for psychiatric purposes, we focus on mental disorders, and movement disorders from medication might be considered adverse effects, but they can be coded in psychiatry.\n\n   - ICD-10 has F06.8 for other mental disorders due to brain damage and dysfunction, which could cover drug-induced disorders. But let's see standard practice.\n\n   - Perhaps in this list, I should include diagnoses that are primary mental disorders.\n\nThe vignette says the patient has schizophrenia, trauma history, seizures likely psychogenic, insomnia, and PANDAS history.\n\nTop 5 most likely:\n\n1. Primary diagnosis: Schizophrenia, as it's the reason for antipsychotic treatment and has clear symptoms.\n\n2. Conversion Disorder with seizures, given the description of seizures.\n\n3. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder or Other Trauma-Related Disorder, due to history of abuse and neglect.\n\n4. Insomnia Disorder.\n\n5. For the fifth, perhaps Medication-Induced Movement Disorder, but since it's a side effect, might not be a standalone diagnosis. Alternatively, given PANDAS history, but no current symptoms, so maybe not. Or Adjustment Disorder if trauma is affecting her.\n\nAnother possibility: Since the seizures are stress-related and she has trauma, it could be part of a somatic symptom disorder. Conversion disorder is a type of somatic symptom disorder.\n\nAlso, note that she has akathisia from medication, which is a movement disorder, but in psychiatric diagnosis, it can be listed.\n\nI need to prioritize based on the vignette. The current concerns are tremor (side effect) and seizures (possibly psychogenic). Schizophrenia is controlled.\n\nLet's list in order of prominence:\n\n- Schizophrenia is the underlying condition.\n\n- Conversion disorder for seizures is a key issue presented.\n\n- PTSD from childhood trauma.\n\n- Insomnia is chronic.\n\n- Fifth could be Medication-Induced Akathisia or something else.\n\nBut the instruction says \"top 5 most likely diagnoses,\" so I should list the most relevant psychiatric conditions.\n\nConfirm ICD-10 codes:\n\n- Schizophrenia, paranoid type: F20.0\n\n- Conversion disorder with seizures: F44.5\n\n- Post-traumatic stress disorder: F43.1\n\n- Insomnia disorder: F51.01\n\n- For PANDAS: If I include it, what code? PANDAS is not a specific ICD-10 code. It might be under F42.8 (Other obsessive-compulsive disorders) or F95.8 (Other tic disorders). But since it's past history and no current symptoms, perhaps omit it.\n\n- Medication-induced akathisia: ICD-10 code G21.1 for neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism, but G21.1 is not an F-code. In ICD-10, drug-induced movement disorders are in G25 series. So, not psychiatric F-code.\n\n   - For psychiatric adverse effects, there might be F codes like F06.8, but it's vague.\n\n   - Perhaps I should avoid including medication side effects as diagnoses in this list.\n\nThe user said \"psychiatric diagnoses,\" so movement disorders from medication might not be considered primary psychiatric diagnoses but rather adverse effects.\n\nIn DSM-5-TR, Medication-Induced Movement Disorders are listed, but for ICD-10, they have specific codes outside F chapter.\n\nTo adhere to the instruction: \"Do not include non-psychiatric diagnoses that do not use F-codes.\" So, only use F-codes.\n\nTherefore, epilepsy is not included because it's neurological with G codes.\n\nSimilarly, medication-induced tremor or akathisia might not have F-codes, so I should not include them.\n\nSo, for psychiatric diagnoses with F-codes:\n\n1. Schizophrenia: F20.0\n\n2. Conversion Disorder: F44.5\n\n3. PTSD: F43.1\n\n4. Insomnia Disorder: F51.01\n\n5. What else? PANDAS is not a standard diagnosis, but it could be classified under OCD or tic disorder. Since no current symptoms, maybe it's not active. But the vignette lists it as past medical history, so it might be considered a lifelong condition. In psychiatry, past diagnoses can be listed if relevant.\n\n   - Alternatively, since she has trauma, perhaps Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder, but PTSD is likely.\n\n   - Or Adjustment Disorder, but with chronic trauma, PTSD is more appropriate.\n\nAnother thought: The seizures might be part of Somatic Symptom Disorder, but conversion disorder is specific for neurological symptoms.\n\nIn DSM-5-TR, Conversion Disorder (Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder) is under Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders.\n\nYes.\n\nFor the fifth diagnosis, perhaps \"Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder\" due to PANDAS history, but I need to see if there's enough information.\n\nThe vignette doesn't mention current OCD symptoms, so perhaps it's not a current diagnosis. But it's part of her history, so it might be listed as a secondary diagnosis.\n\nI think the top five should be:\n\n1. Schizophrenia\n\n2. Conversion Disorder\n\n3. PTSD\n\n4. Insomnia Disorder\n\n5. Either PANDAS-related or Medication-Induced Disorder, but since medication-induced might not have F-code, I'll go with PANDAS under an OCD code.\n\nCheck ICD-10 for OCD: F42 for obsessive-compulsive disorder. But PANDAS is specific, so perhaps F42.8.\n\nUpon second thought, in the vignette, PANDAS is listed as past medical history, but no current symptoms are described, so it might not be an active diagnosis. However, in psychiatric evaluation, past diagnoses are often included if they have ongoing relevance.\n\nSince the instruction is to diagnose based on the vignette, and it's mentioned, I should consider it.\n\nBut let's see the current presentation: The chief concerns are tremor and seizures. Schizophrenia is controlled. So, conversion disorder for seizures is prominent.\n\nI think a reasonable list is:\n\n1. Schizophrenia - F20.0\n\n2. Conversion Disorder (Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder) with seizures - F44.5\n\n3. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder - F43.1\n\n4. Insomnia Disorder - F51.01\n\n5. For the fifth, since she has a history of PANDAS, and it's a neuropsychiatric condition, I could include \"Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder\" - F42.8, but to be precise, perhaps \"Tic Disorder\" if associated, but not specified.\n\n   - Alternatively, given the trauma and stress, \"Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder\" if PTSD criteria aren't fully met, but the vignette says \"untreated trauma,\" implying it's significant.\n\n   - I think PTSD is likely.\n\nAnother idea: The patient has schizophrenia, and sometimes there can be comorbid conditions. Since she has epilepsy diagnosed, but that's neurological, not psychiatric.\n\nWait, the seizures are likely psychogenic, so conversion disorder covers that.\n\nI recall that in DSM-5-TR, for medication-induced movement disorders, there are codes like T43.3X5A for adverse effect of antipsychotics, but that's not an F-code. So, probably not.\n\nSo, I'll proceed with the above.\n\nPrimary diagnosis: Which one is primary? The vignette starts with her presenting for tremor, but the underlying condition is schizophrenia. In psychiatry, the primary diagnosis might be the one requiring most attention. Here, schizophrenia is diagnosed and treated, so it could be primary.\n\nThe seizures are a new concern, but conversion disorder might be secondary.\n\nIn the list, I need to specify primary and secondary. The format says \"primary diagnosis\" and then \"secondary diagnoses\".\n\nSo, primary should be the most significant psychiatric condition. Likely schizophrenia, as it's the reason for her inpatient stay and medication.\n\nBut conversion disorder is also significant. However, in the context, schizophrenia is the established diagnosis.\n\nI think schizophrenia is primary.\n\nThen secondary: conversion disorder, PTSD, insomnia, and PANDAS-related.\n\nFinal list:\n\n1. Schizophrenia, Paranoid Type - ICD-10 F20.0\n\n2. Conversion Disorder with Seizures - ICD-10 F44.5\n\n3. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder - ICD-10 F43.1\n\n4. Insomnia Disorder - ICD-10 F51.01\n\n5. Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder (due to PANDAS history) - ICD-10 F42.8\n\nFor F42.8, it's \"Other obsessive-compulsive disorders\". Alternatively, for tics, F95.8, but PANDAS often involves both.\n\nTo be safe, I'll use F42.8.\n\nI should ensure all are valid F-codes.\n\nInsomnia Disorder: F51.01 is for primary insomnia, but if it's due to another condition, it might be coded as F51.05 for insomnia due to another mental disorder. But chronic insomnia is stated, so F51.01 is fine.\n\nFor PTSD, F43.1 is correct.\n\nFor conversion disorder, F44.5 is for conversion disorder with seizures or convulsions.\n\nFor schizophrenia, F20.0.\n\nFor the fifth, since PANDAS is not a standard code, and no current symptoms, perhaps it's better to include \"Unspecified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder\" or something else.\n\nBut the vignette says \"untreated trauma,\" so PTSD is implied.\n\nI think this list covers the key points.",

    "vignette":"A 12-year-old girl presented with an acute onset of a 1month history of recurrent undesired and intrusive thoughts demanding her to repeat or stop doing certain behaviors to prevent unrelated danger (killing herself or going out in the street). She has stopped eating. The family frequently visited the emergency room (ER) to administer intravenous (IV) fluids. She started dressing and redressing for around 1\u2009hr, repeated washing for around 1\u2009hr, crossing her hands and scratching the wall, and crying and fearing killing herself or going out in the street.

She was doing well in school but had frequent absences in the last month before the presentation. Pregnancy, birth, and early development are unremarkable. Medical history: in this initial visit, the family denied the patient had any medical illnesses. The impression was that the patient had OCD. The treatment was SSRI and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). However, because of the acute onset and severity of her symptoms, the patient was reevaluated in follow-up with consideration of possible pediatric acute neuropsychiatric syndrome. She reported that she had recurrent tonsillitis in the last year before presentation, and her last infection was just before the start of her symptoms. Her recurrent tonsillitis was severe to the extent that a tonsillectomy was advised 6-month ago. The obsessive thoughts were associated with symptoms of separation anxiety, being forgetful, and abnormal sensations (tingling sensation) in her palms and feet.

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me carefully analyze this clinical vignette step by step. The patient is a 12-year-old girl with acute onset of symptoms over one month. She has intrusive thoughts about harming herself or going into the street, which she tries to neutralize through compulsive behaviors like dressing\/redressing for an hour, repeated washing, crossing hands and scratching walls. She's stopped eating, requiring ER visits for IV fluids. There's also separation anxiety, forgetfulness, and abnormal tingling sensations in her palms and feet affecting her shoe-wearing behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to extract all relevant clinical data systematically. The acute onset following recurrent tonsillitis is crucial here - her last infection was just before symptom onset, and she had severe recurrent tonsillitis requiring advised tonsillectomy. The initial impression was OCD, but the reevaluation suggests possible pediatric acute neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS). \n\nLooking at diagnostic criteria: The obsessive thoughts and compulsions clearly meet criteria for OCD. However, the acute onset, preceding streptococcal infection (recurrent tonsillitis), and associated neurological symptoms (tingling sensations, forgetfulness) strongly point toward PANS, which often presents with abrupt OCD symptoms. The separation anxiety could be part of this syndrome too.\n\nFor differential diagnosis, I should consider primary OCD, but the acute post-infectious onset makes PANS more likely as the primary diagnosis. The tingling sensations might suggest conversion disorder or somatic symptom disorder, but they're better explained as part of PANS. The separation anxiety could warrant its own diagnosis, but it appears secondary to the neuropsychiatric condition. The refusal to eat might indicate avoidant\/restrictive food intake, but again seems driven by obsessive thoughts rather than a primary eating disorder.\n\nI need to prioritize based on DSM-5-TR categories. PANS isn't a distinct DSM diagnosis but would fall under \"Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder\" due to the medical etiology. The OCD symptoms are prominent enough to list separately too. The separation anxiety appears clinically significant. The eating disturbance and somatic symptoms should also be considered.\n\nFor ICD-10 codes: F42.2 for mixed obsessional thoughts\/acts, F43.22 for adjustment disorder with anxiety (though separation anxiety disorder might be F93.0), F45.8 for other somatic symptom disorders, and F50.8 for other eating disorders. Wait, I need to check if the eating problem is severe enough for an independent diagnosis or if it's better captured as part of OCD\/PANS.\n\nThe structure should list the most likely primary diagnosis first, then secondary ones. Given the acute onset post-infection and neuropsychiatric features, PANS-related diagnosis should be primary, followed by OCD, separation anxiety, somatic symptoms, and the eating issue.",

    "vignette":"A 44-year-old female patient, without a personal or family history of psychiatric illness, was admitted to a psychiatric ward for a psychotic episode which has started three days before, characterized by perplexity, self-referent and mystical delusions, irritability, disorganized behavior, and aggressiveness, that had emerged shortly after a cluster of nocturnal GTC seizures. Neither Schneider's first-rank symptoms nor negative symptoms of schizophrenia were present. Additionally, some degree of mental confusion with temporal disorientation, as well as sustained, divided attention and memory deficits were noticed during psychiatric hospitalization. Past medical history was relevant for epilepsy since her early thirties, which had developed after a moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). She did not regularly attend follow-up neurology appointments and had poor adherence to antiepileptic treatment. Ancillary tests undergone during a previous hospitalization in a neurology ward (seven years before the hospitalization in psychiatry) had documented a focal slowing activity in the left frontotemporal topography on electroencephalogram (EEG) and a right cortico-subcortical parietooccipital lesion of encephalomalacia on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Additionally, she presented an amnestic mild cognitive impairment, possibly secondary to both the poorly controlled epilepsy and the prior TBI.\n\nDuring the hospitalization in the psychiatric ward for the index psychotic episode, haematological and biochemical screening, thyroid function, folic acid, and cyanocobalamin were normal, serologies for VDRL, HIV, and B and C hepatitis were negative, and valproic acid levels were subtherapeutic.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the clinical vignette. The patient is a 44-year-old woman with no prior psychiatric history, admitted for a psychotic episode that started three days before. The symptoms include perplexity, mystical delusions, irritability, disorganized behavior, and aggression. These emerged after a cluster of nocturnal generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures.\n\nShe has a history of epilepsy since her early thirties due to a moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Poor adherence to antiepileptic treatment and not attending neurology follow-ups are noted. Previous tests show focal slowing on EEG in the left frontotemporal area and a right parietooccipital lesion on MRI. There's also mention of amnestic mild cognitive impairment, possibly from both the epilepsy and TBI.\n\nDuring the current psychiatric hospitalization, lab tests are normal except for subtherapeutic valproic acid levels. No Schneiderian first-rank symptoms or negative symptoms of schizophrenia are present. There's also mental confusion, temporal disorientation, attention, and memory deficits.\n\nFirst, I need to focus on data extraction. The key points are the acute onset of psychosis post-seizures, history of epilepsy from TBI, poor medication adherence, abnormal EEG and MRI findings, cognitive impairment, and no prior psychiatric history. The confusion and orientation issues suggest an organic component.\n\nNow, for diagnostic reasoning. The psychosis started right after seizures, which points to a possible postictal psychosis. Since the epilepsy is due to TBI, and there are structural brain changes, psychosis due to another medical condition (like epilepsy or TBI) is likely. The cognitive deficits and confusion support an organic cause.\n\nSchizophrenia is less likely because of the acute onset, absence of first-rank symptoms, and negative symptoms. The temporal link to seizures and underlying neurological issues make primary psychotic disorders less probable.\n\nOther considerations include delirium given the confusion and disorientation, but the vignette mentions sustained issues, so maybe it's not acute delirium. However, the subtherapeutic antiepileptic levels could contribute to seizure activity and subsequent psychosis.\n\nBipolar disorder with psychotic features is a possibility, but there's no mention of mood symptoms here. The irritability and aggression could be part of the psychosis rather than a mood episode.\n\nSubstance-induced psychosis isn't indicated since labs are normal, and no substance use is mentioned.\n\nSo, the primary diagnosis should be psychosis due to epilepsy or TBI. The cognitive impairment is noted as mild cognitive impairment, possibly due to epilepsy and TBI. The poor adherence to antiepileptics leading to subtherapeutic levels might complicate the picture.\n\nPutting it all together, the top diagnosis is Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition, with epilepsy and TBI as the underlying causes. Then, Mild Cognitive Impairment due to the same. Other differentials include Schizophreniaform Disorder, but the organic factors are strong. Delirium should be considered but might not fit the sustained attention deficits. However, the confusion and disorientation could indicate delirium superimposed on the psychosis.\n\nWait, the vignette says \"some degree of mental confusion with temporal disorientation\" and attention\/memory deficits during hospitalization. That sounds like delirium, especially with subtherapeutic antiepileptic levels possibly leading to ongoing seizure activity or withdrawal.\n\nBut the psychosis started after seizures, which is typical for postictal psychosis. However, postictal psychosis is usually a diagnosis under Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition. Given the history, it's likely the primary issue.\n\nAlso, the cognitive impairment is specified as amnestic mild cognitive impairment, so that should be listed separately.\n\nOther secondary diagnoses could include Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder if the organic cause isn't fully accounted for, but the vignette strongly points to medical etiology.\n\nPersonality disorders aren't indicated since there's no prior history. Anxiety or depressive disorders aren't mentioned either.\n\nSo, the structured list: Primary is Psychotic Disorder Due to Epilepsy and TBI. Then Mild Neurocognitive Disorder due to TBI and epilepsy. Delirium should be considered given the confusion, but it might be part of the psychotic episode. However, the vignette mentions sustained attention deficits, which could be part of the cognitive impairment rather than acute delirium.\n\nMaybe Delirium due to multiple etiologies (epilepsy, medication non-adherence) is possible. But the vignette doesn't specify acute fluctuation, so mild cognitive impairment might be more chronic.\n\nWait, the confusion and disorientation were noticed during hospitalization, which could be acute. But it's described as \"some degree of mental confusion,\" which might not meet full delirium criteria. However, with subtherapeutic antiepileptic levels, there's a risk of seizures or withdrawal contributing to an altered mental state.\n\nGiven the complexity, I'll prioritize Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition as primary, then Mild Neurocognitive Disorder, and consider other psychotic disorders or delirium as secondary.\n\nLet me check the DSM-5-TR codes. Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition is F06.2. Mild Neurocognitive Disorder due to TBI and epilepsy would be F06.7. Delirium due to another medical condition (epilepsy) might be F05. However, the vignette doesn't clearly state delirium, so perhaps it's not the focus.\n\nOther differentials: Brief Psychotic Disorder if it's less than a month, but with the medical history, it's likely due to the medical condition. Schizophrenia requires longer duration, so not applicable.\n\nTherefore, the list: 1. Psychotic Disorder Due to Epilepsy and Traumatic Brain Injury - F06.2. 2. Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Traumatic Brain Injury and Epilepsy - F06.7. 3. Delirium Due to Another Medical Condition (Epilepsy) - F05. 4. Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder (Postictal Psychosis) - F28. 5. Unspecified Neurocognitive Disorder - F09.\n\nBut I need to ensure these are based strictly on the vignette. The patient has epilepsy from TBI, psychosis after seizures, cognitive impairment. Delirium is hinted but not confirmed. Postictal psychosis is a specific type under psychotic disorder due to epilepsy. So, maybe the primary is that, and the others follow accordingly.",

    "vignette":"J is a mid-20s military service member living independently in the community with a partner. J has a history of multiple ACEs (ACE scale score of 10\/10), with caregivers that were both physically and emotionally abusive when J's needs were voiced, resulting in a belief that it was unacceptable, unsafe, and futile to resolve interpersonal problems with caregivers, thus creating a sense of powerlessness and helplessness. Child and family services were never involved, and no legal charges were ever laid against the family for the abuse that J endured. J struggled with containing anger since early childhood resulting in physical and verbal aggression towards peers and teachers at school and family members at home. Caregivers attempted to contain J's aggressive behavior through forced administration of psychiatric medication. While growing up, J feared others and preferred to be alone, despite longing for family and friends. Socialization with peers proved difficult, as J was easily overwhelmed by noise associated with social contact and was frequently ridiculed or misunderstood while trying to verbally communicate.\n\nAs a young adult, J left family to enter the military, which became an immediate source of attachment and social belonging. More recently, J became increasingly unable to cope with anger following an ill-suited work position and a musculoskeletal injury, resulting in frequent angry verbal altercations and threats of violence towards military peers who placed restrictions on his activities. This led to disciplinary action and isolation from the unit, which further increased anger, hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts and led to a psychiatric military assessment. During the assessment, J disclosed feelings of intense anger which eventually manifested in an attack on a family member in an amnestic dissociated state. J's history indicated that pharmacological treatments had either been ineffective or caused significant side effects. The military psychiatrist determined J ought to be considered for military discharge. This triggered flashbacks of past childhood abuse and a significant increase in rage. J refused trials of psychiatric medications in the community due to a childhood history of forced medication administration. Due to significant safety concerns and limited ability to control aggressive behavior in the community, J's military psychiatrist referred J for an inpatient admission.\n\nOn initial assessment for admission, J appeared distrustful, angry, and concerned about acting out on anger and expressed suicidal ideation. On mental status examination, J was tall and appeared neatly dressed in a military uniform. J appeared hypervigilant and intensely watchful and was well spoken, using a \u201csharp\u201d tone of voice. J provided a detailed history, demonstrating a goal-directed thought form and a high level of abstract thinking, logical analysis, and good recall. There were no delusions or hallucinations, but J endorsed prominent active suicidal ideation, with intent to act upon these thoughts if not hospitalized; however, there were no immediate, specific suicide plans.",

The patient presents with multiple layers of trauma, anger issues, and current suicidal ideation. \n\nThe history of severe childhood abuse (ACEs score 10\/10) combined with current dissociative amnesia during violent episodes strongly suggests trauma-related disorders. The chronic interpersonal difficulties, anger containment problems since childhood, and pattern of unstable relationships point toward personality pathology. \n\nFor primary diagnosis, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder fits best given the flashbacks, dissociative episodes, and hypervigilance directly linked to trauma. The recurrent dissociative amnesia during aggressive outbursts is particularly telling. \n\nBorderline Personality Disorder is a close second due to the chronic anger, identity disturbance (shifting from isolated to military attachment), and frantic efforts to avoid abandonment (military discharge triggering crisis). The suicidal ideation under stress is classic. \n\nIntermittent Explosive Disorder explains the lifelong pattern of aggressive outbursts disproportionate to triggers. The amnestic dissociation during the family attack might represent a severe form of this. \n\nPersistent Depressive Disorder seems likely given the chronic hopelessness and negative self-view, though it might be better conceptualized as part of the personality pathology. \n\nAdjustment Disorder captures the acute worsening following military disciplinary actions, though it's probably secondary to the more chronic conditions. \n\nThe military context and lack of psychosis rule out other considerations.

    "vignette":"Our patient was a 41-year-old man with diagnoses of schizoaffective disorder and polysubstance use disorder who was admitted to the inpatient psychiatry unit after an extended stay (24 days) in the psychiatric emergency department, where he presented with manic and psychotic symptoms, including mood lability, pressured speech, grandiosity, paranoia, and disorganized thinking, in the context of medication noncompliance and elopement from his group home. His prolonged psychiatric emergency department course was due to difficulty finding an available inpatient psychiatric bed at or within a reasonable radius of the receiving hospital. Per the patient's guardian, medications confirmed 6 weeks prior to admission included divalproex extended-release (ER) 500\u2009mg twice daily, clonazepam 0.5\u2009mg twice daily, risperidone 4\u2009mg twice daily, risperidone microspheres long-acting injection 25\u2009mg every 2 weeks, quetiapine 400\u2009mg daily, and trazodone 100\u2009mg daily. Based on the fill history and patient report, nonadherence was likely in the weeks prior to admission.\n\nLimited information was available regarding the patient's past psychiatric history, as he was a difficult historian due to his mental state at the time of the initial assessment, as noted above. From a review of available records, he was noted to have been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder in his early twenties and to have been prescribed multiple medications at various points to address manic and psychotic symptoms, including risperidone (up to 8\u2009mg per day of the oral form and up to 25\u2009mg every 14 days of the long-acting injectable form), quetiapine (up to 400\u2009mg per day), and divalproex (up to 1500\u2009mg per day). He was also prescribed trazodone for sleep (up to 50\u2009mg per day) and sertraline for anxiety (unclear dose and duration per records). A note was made of at least partial response to risperidone and divalproex for manic and psychotic symptoms, though the durability of these effects was difficult to assess due to poor compliance. Records documented a history of over 30 psychiatric hospitalizations, usually in the setting of medication noncompliance leading to symptom relapse, with two such hospitalizations in the year prior to presentation. Mention was also made of a suicide attempt three years prior to the presentation, though the circumstances of this were unclear (the patient had reported this to an emergency room provider at an outside hospital; he denied any such history on evaluation in our psychiatric emergency room).\n\nA history of \u201csemi-regular\u201d use of alcohol and cannabis was also noted in his records, beginning in his early twenties, though specific amounts, frequency, adverse consequences, and any treatment for substance use were not documented. Notably, his urine toxicology screen was negative at the time of presentation to our psychiatric emergency room.\n\nMedically, a history of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (for which the patient had refused treatment with medications) was noted, with the last documented CD4 count being in the 430s range at an outside hospital one year prior to presentation.\n\nFamily history was significant for schizophrenia and suicide in a maternal uncle. In terms of social history, records indicated that the patient was an only child and that his parents separated when he was an infant; he was noted to have had no relationship with his father. He reported no history of domestic or family conflicts but also noted no current social support at the time of presentation. There was no documented history of his experiencing physical or sexual abuse, though he referred in a prior emergency room visit to a history of \u201cverbal abuse\u201d (unclear how long ago or by whom). He was also noted to have been married in the past but separated for 20 years prior to the presentation; he had no children. He was noted to have lived in numerous group homes over the prior ten years due to mental health issues, with frequent periods of homelessness between these stays, including for three days prior to presentation after he had absconded from his last group home due to paranoid concerns about the staff and residents there. Educationally, he was noted to have completed high school and college but to have been unemployed for ten years prior to presentation, receiving disability income, and having a guardian appointed to him due to mental health issues.\n\nPhysical examination upon initial presentation in the psychiatric emergency room was unremarkable other than the patient appearing disheveled, irritable, and guarded. Vital signs were within normal limits. Laboratory tests, including electrolytes, liver function tests, complete blood count, thyroid function tests, urine analysis, and urine drug screen, were all within normal limits.\n\nOn mental status examination, he showed loud, pressured speech, guarded and labile affect, irritable and elevated mood, disorganized (tangential, loose) thinking, paranoid delusions that staff and residents at the group home where he had been living were involved in a conspiracy against him, no reported suicidal or homicidal ideation, and poor insight (e.g., denying that he had any mental health issues and that he only needed sertraline to \u201cclear his head\u201d).",

Neurological exam limited due to uncooperativeness.\n\n- Mental state examination: Impaired orientation to time, place, person; attention ill-sustained; increased speech rate with flight of ideas; irritable affect; delusion of grandiosity.\n\n- Investigations: All normal (blood parameters, urine, thyroid, calcium, albumin, magnesium, vitamins B12 and D).\n\n- Scores: DRS-R-98 score 20 (likely Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98, indicating delirium), YMRS score 22 (Young Mania Rating Scale, indicating mania), BFCRS score 5 (Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale, mild catatonia features).\n\nNow, I need to organize this information logically to support diagnosis. Key elements:\n\n- Age: 82 years, elderly.\n\n- Past psychiatric history: Depression, treated and remitted, but antidepressant discontinued 1 month prior.\n\n- Family history: Alzheimer's dementia in first-degree relative.\n\n- Current symptoms: Manic-like symptoms (elevated mood, well-being, talkativeness, overspending, increased appetite, energy, overactivity) for 10 days, followed by confusion, disorientation, psychosis (delusions), behavioral disturbances (aggression, incontinence), sleep disturbance, and catatonic features (stupor, echolalia).\n\n- Normal investigations rule out common medical causes like infections, metabolic disorders, vitamin deficiencies.\n\n- Assessment scores suggest both delirium and mania, with some catatonia.\n\nNow, for diagnostic reasoning. I need to generate a differential diagnosis considering DSM-5-TR criteria.\n\nPrimary considerations:\n\n1. **Manic Episode**: Symptoms like elevated mood, increased energy, talkativeness, overspending, flight of ideas, irritability, delusions of grandiosity. YMRS score of 22 supports mania. However, the context includes elderly age, no prior history of bipolar disorder, and subsequent confusion and delirium-like symptoms.\n\n2. **Delirium**: Confusion, disorientation, agitation, incoherence, impaired attention, sleep-wake disturbance, and rapid onset. DRS-R-98 score of 20 indicates delirium. But manic symptoms preceded delirium, and investigations are normal, so it might be due to a psychiatric condition or other causes.\n\n3. **Neurocognitive Disorder**: Given age and family history of Alzheimer's, but no prior forgetfulness or dementia features. However, acute confusion could be due to delirium superimposed on an undiagnosed neurocognitive disorder, but vignette says no history of dementia.\n\n4. **Psychotic Disorder**: Delusions (grandiosity, poisoning), but manic symptoms are prominent, so it might be part of a mood disorder.\n\n5. **Catatonia**: Stupor and echolalia, BFCRS score of 5, suggesting catatonia. Catatonia can occur in various disorders, including mood disorders, psychotic disorders, or medical conditions.\n\nSince antidepressant was discontinued 1 month prior, consider **antidepressant withdrawal** or **switch to mania** if it was an SSRI or similar, but symptoms started 10 days before presentation, not immediately after discontinuation.\n\nGiven the sequence: manic symptoms for 10 days, then confusion and behavioral changes leading to admission. This could be a manic episode that escalated into a delirious mania or a mixed state.\n\nIn elderly, new-onset mania can be due to medical conditions, but investigations are normal. Also, consider **Bipolar I Disorder, Manic Episode with Psychotic Features**, but age of onset is late.\n\nAnother possibility: **Mood Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition**, but medical workup is negative.\n\n**Substance-Induced Mood Disorder** \u2013 no substance use history.\n\n**Schizoaffective Disorder** \u2013 but mood symptoms are predominant and acute.\n\n**Major Neurocognitive Disorder with Behavioral Disturbance** \u2013 but no prior cognitive decline noted.\n\nGiven the scores and symptoms, the most likely primary diagnosis is **Bipolar I Disorder, Current Episode Manic, with Psychotic Features**, but the delirium aspect complicates it. Alternatively, **Delirium** might be primary due to an unseen cause, but manic symptoms are prominent.\n\nIn DSM-5, catatonia can be specified with various disorders. Here, catatonia features are present.\n\nICD-10 codes: I need to assign F-codes.\n\n- For Bipolar I Disorder, manic episode with psychotic features: F31.2 (Bipolar affective disorder, current episode manic with psychotic symptoms).\n\n- For Delirium: F05 (Delirium due to known physiological condition or unspecified). Since no medical cause found, it might be F05.9 (Unspecified delirium).\n\n- For Catatonia: F06.1 (Catatonic disorder due to known physiological condition) or as a specifier. But in DSM-5, catatonia can be a specifier for mood disorders.\n\n- For Major Neurocognitive Disorder: F03 (Unspecified dementia) but not supported by history.\n\n- For Depression in remission: F33.9 (Major depressive disorder, in remission), but current episode is manic.\n\nPast depression is in remission, so not an active diagnosis.\n\nThe vignette says she was treated for depression and remitted, but antidepressant was stopped 1 month prior. This could indicate a recurrent depressive episode or part of bipolar disorder if mania emerges.\n\nGiven the manic symptoms, it might be a first manic episode in late life, suggesting Bipolar I Disorder.\n\nBut the confusion and delirium-like symptoms could be due to **Delirious Mania**, which is a severe form of mania with catatonic features.\n\nIn DSM-5, delirious mania is not a separate diagnosis but can be considered under Bipolar I Disorder with catatonic features and delirium.\n\nAlso, consider **Schizophreniaform Disorder** or **Brief Psychotic Disorder**, but duration is 10 days of manic symptoms and 4 days of confusion, so over 2 weeks, which might fit acute psychotic disorder, but manic symptoms are key.\n\nTop 5 diagnoses:\n\n1. Primary: Bipolar I Disorder, Current Episode Manic, with Psychotic Features, with Catatonic Features. ICD-10: F31.2 for manic with psychotic symptoms, and catatonia can be specifier, but ICD-10 might code separately for catatonia if due to bipolar.\n\nICD-10 coding: For bipolar disorder, F31.x based on current episode. With psychotic features, F31.2. Catatonia can be added as F06.1 if due to bipolar, but in practice, it might be part of the mood disorder.\n\nI need to list specific F-codes.\n\nCheck ICD-10:\n\n- F31.2: Bipolar affective disorder, current episode manic with psychotic symptoms.\n\n- F05: Delirium, unspecified.\n\n- F06.1: Catatonic disorder due to known physiological condition \u2013 but if due to bipolar, it might be F31.2 with specifier, but ICD-10 may use separate code for catatonia in organic mental disorders.\n\nIn ICD-10, catatonia in mood disorders is included under the mood disorder code, but for organic catatonia, F06.1 is used. Here, no physiological condition identified, so might be due to psychiatric disorder.\n\nPerhaps F06.0 (Organic hallucinosis) or F06.2 (Organic delusional disorder), but not fitting.\n\nBetter to prioritize based on clinical presentation.\n\nGiven the vignette, the patient has manic symptoms, psychosis, catatonia, and delirium. A unifying diagnosis could be **Bipolar I Disorder with Catatonic Features and Delirious Mania**.\n\nBut for differential diagnosis list, I need top 5 most likely.\n\nList:\n\n1. Bipolar I Disorder, Manic Episode with Psychotic Features \u2013 primary.\n\n2. Delirium \u2013 secondary due to manic exhaustion or other cause.\n\n3. Catatonia \u2013 associated feature.\n\n4. Major Depressive Disorder, in remission \u2013 past history.\n\n5. Rule out Neurocognitive Disorder, but not supported, so perhaps Mood Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition, but workup negative.\n\nSince investigations are normal, less likely medical cause.\n\nFor secondary diagnoses, include conditions that are relevant but not primary.\n\nPast depression is in remission, so it's a historical diagnosis.\n\nCurrent active diagnoses are manic episode, delirium, catatonia.\n\nIn DSM-5, catatonia can be diagnosed as Catatonic Disorder Not Elsewhere Classified if not due to another mental disorder, but here it's likely due to mood disorder.\n\nFor ICD-10 codes:\n\n- F31.2: Bipolar affective disorder, current episode manic with psychotic symptoms.\n\n- F05.9: Delirium, unspecified.\n\n- F06.1: Catatonic disorder due to known physiological condition \u2013 but if we assume due to bipolar, it might be part of F31.2. However, in coding, if catatonia is prominent, it can be coded separately.\n\nTo be precise, I'll list based on likelihood.\n\nPrimary diagnosis: Bipolar I Disorder, as it explains manic symptoms, psychosis, and can account for delirium and catatonia as severe features.\n\nSecondary: Delirium, as evidenced by confusion and DRS score.\n\nSecondary: Catatonia.\n\nSecondary: Past Major Depressive Disorder.\n\nSecondary: Rule out something like Schizoaffective Disorder, but less likely.\n\nAnother possibility: **Unspecified Bipolar and Related Disorder** if not full criteria, but seems full.\n\nGiven the age, **Late-Onset Bipolar Disorder** is a consideration.\n\nAlso, since antidepressant was stopped, consider **Antidepressant Discontinuation Syndrome** or **Mania Induced by Antidepressant Withdrawal**, but timeline: antidepressant stopped 1 month prior, symptoms started 10 days before presentation, so not immediate.\n\nFor F-codes:\n\n1. F31.2 \u2013 Bipolar affective disorder, current episode manic with psychotic symptoms.\n\n2. F05.9 \u2013 Delirium, unspecified.\n\n3. F06.1 \u2013 Catatonic disorder due to known physiological condition? Or F06.1 for catatonia associated with bipolar. In ICD-10, catatonia in schizophrenia or mood disorders is coded under the primary disorder, but there is F06.1 for organic catatonic disorder. Since no medical cause found, and it's psychiatric, it might be included in F31.2.\n\nLooking up ICD-10:\n\n- F31.2 includes manic episode with psychotic symptoms.\n\n- For catatonia in mood disorders, the code is still F31.2 if it's part of the episode.\n\n- Delirium can be coded separately if present.\n\nIn practice, for billing, multiple codes can be used.\n\nBut for this exercise, I need to list five diagnoses with F-codes.\n\nPerhaps:\n\n1. F31.2 \u2013 Bipolar I Disorder, Current Episode Manic with Psychotic Features.\n\n2. F05.9 \u2013 Delirium.\n\n3. F06.1 \u2013 Catatonic Disorder (assuming it's due to the bipolar disorder or unspecified).\n\n4. F33.9 \u2013 Major Depressive Disorder, in remission (past history).\n\n5. F09 \u2013 Unspecified mental disorder due to known physiological condition? But workup negative, so not. Or F29 \u2013 Unspecified nonorganic psychosis, but less likely.\n\nAnother thought: Given the acute confusion and normal labs, consider **Late-Life Mania** which is often associated with medical conditions, but here no medical illness found, so primary psychiatric.\n\nPerhaps include **Unspecified Neurocognitive Disorder** as a rule-out, but since no history, not likely.\n\nFor secondary, include **Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD)** but no dementia diagnosis.\n\nBest to stick with what's supported.\n\nFinal list:\n\n1. Primary: Bipolar I Disorder, Manic Episode with Psychotic Features \u2013 F31.2\n\n2. Secondary: Delirium \u2013 F05.9\n\n3. Secondary: Catatonia \u2013 F06.1 (or as specifier, but code separately)\n\n4. Secondary: Major Depressive Disorder, in remission \u2013 F33.9\n\n5. Secondary: Unspecified Mood Disorder \u2013 if not full bipolar, but seems full, so perhaps **Other Specified Bipolar and Related Disorder** \u2013 F31.89, but less likely than the above.\n\nOr include **Schizoaffective Disorder** \u2013 F25.9, but mood symptoms are manic and acute, so bipolar is more fitting.\n\nGiven the vignette, the top diagnoses should reflect the current episode and past history.\n\nI think:\n\n1. F31.2 \u2013 Bipolar affective disorder, current episode manic with psychotic symptoms.\n\n2. F05.9 \u2013 Delirium, unspecified.\n\n3. F06.1 \u2013 Catatonic disorder due to known physiological condition? To be accurate, in ICD-10, if catatonia is due to a mental disorder like bipolar, it is coded under that disorder, but there is no separate code. However, F06.1 is for organic catatonic disorder, which requires a physiological cause. Since no cause found, it might be inappropriate.\n\nInstead, use F06.1 only if we assume an underlying organic cause, but vignette says normal investigations.\n\nPerhaps for catatonia, use F06.1 with the cause unspecified, or as part of F31.2.\n\nIn DSM-5, catatonia can be specified with bipolar disorder.\n\nFor ICD-10, the primary code is F31.2, and catatonia is a feature.\n\nBut the rubric says to list diagnoses, so I can include catatonia as a separate diagnosis if it meets criteria.\n\nFrom the vignette: \"stupor and echolalia\" and BFCRS score 5, so catatonia is present.\n\nIn ICD-10, catatonia in schizophrenia is F20.2, in mood disorders it's under the mood disorder code.\n\nFor other catatonia, F06.1 is used for organic, and F06.0 for non-organic? Actually, F06.1 is \"Catatonic disorder due to known physiological condition\", and if not due to known condition, it might be F06.1 with unspecified cause, but typically coded as such.\n\nTo simplify, since the primary is likely bipolar with catatonic features, I can list catatonia as secondary due to the mood disorder.\n\nBut let's see the scoring: BFCRS score 5 indicates mild catatonia.\n\nFor past depression, it's in remission, so it's a historical diagnosis that should be listed.\n\nFor delirium, it's active.\n\nSo, for the list:\n\n1. Bipolar I Disorder, Current Episode Manic with Psychotic Features - F31.2\n\n2. Delirium - F05.9\n\n3. Catatonic Disorder Associated with Another Mental Condition (Bipolar Disorder) - perhaps F06.1, but better to use F06.1 for catatonia due to bipolar.\n\nICD-10: F06.1 can be used if the catatonia is due to a general medical condition, but here it's due to psychiatric, so in ICD-10, it might be coded under F31.2 with a note for catatonia.\n\nI think for this exercise, I should list distinct diagnoses as per DSM-5-TR.\n\nIn DSM-5, if catatonia occurs in the context of bipolar disorder, the diagnosis is Bipolar I Disorder with Catatonic Features, and code is still F31.2.\n\nSimilarly, delirium might be due to the manic episode or other causes.\n\nTo list five diagnoses, I can include:\n\n1. F31.2 - Bipolar I Disorder, Manic Episode with Psychotic Features\n\n2. F05.9 - Delirium\n\n3. F06.1 - Catatonic Disorder (assuming it's secondary to the mood disorder or unspecified)\n\n4. F33.9 - Major Depressive Disorder, in remission\n\n5. F09 - Unspecified mental disorder due to known physiological condition? Or F99 - Mental disorder, not otherwise specified.\n\nAnother idea: Since there is a family history of Alzheimer's, but no symptoms, include **Unspecified Neurocognitive Disorder** as a rule-out, but not active.\n\nPerhaps **Unspecified Psychotic Disorder** for the delusions, but they are mood-congruent.\n\nI think the top five based on likelihood:\n\n1. Bipolar I Disorder - primary.\n\n2. Delirium - secondary due to severe mania or other factors.\n\n3. Catatonia - associated.\n\n4. Past Major Depressive Disorder.\n\n5. Rule out: Mood Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition, but since workup negative, less likely, so perhaps **Other Specified Bipolar and Related Disorder** if there's uncertainty.\n\nBut given the scores and presentation, bipolar is most likely.\n\nLet's finalize the list.\n\nPrimary diagnosis should be the main condition accounting for most symptoms. Here, manic symptoms are core, so bipolar.\n\nFor formatting: list the diagnoses with F-codes.\n\nI need to ensure ICD-10 F-codes are correct.\n\n- F31.2: Bipolar affective disorder, current episode manic with psychotic symptoms.\n\n- F05.9: Delirium, unspecified.\n\n- F06.1: Catatonic disorder due to known physiological condition. If no physiological condition known, it might still be used, but in this case, since medical workup is negative, it could be considered due to the psychiatric condition. In ICD-10, for catatonia in schizophrenia or mood disorders, the catatonia is not coded separately; the primary disorder is coded. However, for clinical purposes, if catatonia is a focus, it can be coded.\n\nTo adhere to DSM-5-TR, catatonia can be a specifier for bipolar disorder, so the code is F31.2 with catatonia specifier, which doesn't change the code.\n\nBut for listing, I can include catatonia as a separate diagnosis if it meets criteria for Catatonic Disorder Not Elsewhere Classified, which is F06.1 in ICD-10.\n\nIn DSM-5, Catatonic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition is coded separately, but here no medical condition found, so it might be Catatonia Associated with Another Mental Disorder (Bipolar Disorder), which is not a separate diagnosis but a specifier.\n\nSo, for simplicity, I'll list:\n\n1. Bipolar I Disorder, Current Episode Manic with Psychotic Features - F31.2\n\n2. Delirium - F05.9\n\n3. Catatonic Disorder Due to Bipolar Disorder (or Associated) - F06.1 (considering it as organic due to mental disorder, but ICD-10 might require a physiological cause for F06.1)\n\nUpon second thought, in ICD-10, F06.1 is for \"Catatonic disorder due to known physiological condition\", so if no known physiological condition, it should be F06.1 with the cause unspecified, or use F06.1 with a note that it's due to bipolar, but bipolar is not a physiological condition.\n\nTo avoid inaccuracy, perhaps use F06.1 for catatonia and assume an underlying cause, or use F44.2 for dissociative stupor, but not fitting.\n\nBetter to list catatonia as part of bipolar and not separately.\n\nBut the rubric says to list diagnoses, so I need to include all relevant.\n\nPerhaps for catatonia, use F06.1 and in practice, it might be coded if prominent.\n\nI think I'll proceed with:\n\n1. F31.2 - Bipolar I Disorder, Manic Episode with Psychotic Features\n\n2. F05.9 - Delirium\n\n3. F06.1 - Catatonic Disorder (due to the bipolar disorder or unspecified)\n\n4. F33.9 - Major Depressive Disorder, in remission\n\n5. F09 - Unspecified organic or symptomatic mental disorder (as a catch-all for possible underlying medical cause not identified, but less likely)\n\nF09 is \"Unspecified mental disorder due to known physiological condition\", but since no condition known, it might not be appropriate.\n\nAnother code: F29 - Unspecified nonorganic psychosis, but with mood symptoms, bipolar is better.\n\nFor the fifth, I can list **Unspecified Bipolar and Related Disorder** if there's any doubt, but F31.2 is specific.\n\nGiven that the patient is elderly with new-onset mania, consider **Mood Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition**, but workup negative, so code F06.30 (Mood disorder due to known physiological condition, with depressive features) or F06.33 with manic features, but since no condition, use unspecified.\n\nICD-10 for mood disorder due to known physiological condition with manic features is F06.33, but requires a physiological cause.\n\nSince no cause found, it might be F31.9 for unspecified bipolar.\n\nBut in this case, with psychotic features, F31.2 is more specific.\n\nI think the list is:\n\n1. F31.2\n\n2. F05.9\n\n3. F06.1\n\n4. F33.9\n\n5. F06.33 or F31.9 for completeness, but F31.2 covers it.\n\nPerhaps for the fifth, include **Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer's Disease** as a rule-out due to family history, but no symptoms, so not active. Code F00.9, but that's not an F-code? F00.9 is dementia in Alzheimer's disease, unspecified, which is an F-code.\n\nAll codes starting with F are psychiatric in ICD-10.\n\nF00-F09 are organic mental disorders, so neurocognitive disorders are included.\n\nSo, for Alzheimer's, it's F00.9, but since no diagnosis, not listed.\n\nThe vignette says no history of forgetfulness or dementia, so not applicable.\n\nSo, for secondary diagnoses, I'll go with the active ones.\n\nList:\n\n1. Bipolar I Disorder, Current Episode Manic with Psychotic Features - F31.2\n\n2. Delirium - F05.9\n\n3. Catatonic Disorder - F06.1\n\n4. Major Depressive Disorder, in Remission - F33.9\n\n5. Unspecified Mood Disorder - F39 or Other Specified Bipolar and Related Disorder - F31.89\n\nF39 is Unspecified mood [affective] disorder.\n\nBut to make it precise, since the primary is likely bipolar, the fifth could be a rule-out like Schizoaffective Disorder - F25.9, but less likely.\n\nGiven the manic symptoms and psychosis, bipolar is top.\n\nI think I'll use:\n\n1. F31.2 - Bipolar affective disorder, current episode manic with psychotic symptoms\n\n2. F05.9 - Delirium, unspecified\n\n3. F06.1 - Catatonic disorder due to known physiological condition (assuming due to mental stress or unspecified)\n\n4. F33.9 - Major depressive disorder, single episode or recurrent? From vignette, treated for depression 9 months prior, so likely recurrent, but in remission. F33.9 is for recurrent depressive disorder, unspecified.\n\nF33.9 is Major depressive disorder, recurrent, unspecified.\n\n5. F31.9 - Bipolar affective disorder, unspecified, as a fallback or for mild cases, but here specific.\n\nOr F06.33 - Mood disorder due to known physiological condition with manic features, but no condition found.\n\nSince investigations are normal, F06.33 might not be appropriate.\n\nI recall that in elderly, mania can be due to cerebrovascular disease, but no mention of that.\n\nTo be safe, for the fifth, I'll list **Unspecified Bipolar and Related Disorder** with code F31.9.\n\nBut let's see the sequence: manic symptoms first, then delirium, so delirium might be secondary to mania.\n\nIn DSM-5, delirious mania is a specifier for manic episode.\n\nSo, for the list, I'll output as per formatting.\n\nFinal decision:\n\nPrimary: Bipolar I Disorder, Manic Episode with Psychotic Features - F31.2\n\nSecondary: Delirium - F05.9\n\nSecondary: Catatonia - F06.1\n\nSecondary: Major Depressive Disorder, in Remission - F33.9\n\nSecondary: Other Specified Bipolar and Related Disorder (if considering late-onset or atypical features) - F31.89\n\nBut F31.89 is for other bipolar, which might be redundant with F31.2.\n\nPerhaps for the fifth, include **Unspecified Neurocognitive Disorder** as a consideration due to age and family history, but not active, so not listed.\n\nAnother idea: **Acute and Transient Psychotic Disorders** - F23, but duration and manic symptoms point to bipolar.\n\nI think I'll go with the above.\n\nNow, for the response, I need to output only the list without reasoning.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Bipolar I Disorder, Current Episode Manic with Psychotic Features - F31.2\n\n2. Delirium - F05.9\n\n3. Catatonic Disorder - F06.1\n\n4. Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, in Remission - F33.9\n\n5. Other Specified Bipolar and Related Disorder - F31.89\n\nTo make it accurate, for catatonia, since it's associated with bipolar, perhaps it should be part of the primary, but for listing, I'll keep it separate.\n\nI think this is acceptable.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the clinical vignette provided. The patient is a 25-year-old female, currently 20 weeks pregnant, with a known history of schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type. She's presenting with psychosis and catatonia due to medication nonadherence. The key points here are her existing diagnosis, the pregnancy, and the recurrence of symptoms after stopping medications.\n\nFirst, I need to extract all relevant information. She has a history of multiple psychiatric hospitalizations since childhood, a suicide attempt two years ago, and was previously stabilized on paliperidone and lithium. She discontinued meds after moving abroad and returned to the US a month ago. Her symptoms worsened in the week leading to admission, including disorganization, auditory and visual hallucinations, agitation, and resistance to care. Her father petitioned for involuntary admission due to severity.\n\nNow, organizing this data. The primary issue seems to be a recurrence of her known schizoaffective disorder due to nonadherence. The vignette explicitly states this history, and the current symptoms align with that\u2014psychosis with hallucinations, disorganization, agitation. Catatonia is also mentioned, which can be a feature of several psychotic disorders.\n\nConsidering diagnostic reasoning, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, is the most likely primary diagnosis given the history and current psychotic symptoms. The catatonia specifier might apply here since she's showing agitation and resistance, which could be part of catatonic features. However, catatonia itself can be a separate diagnosis if it's prominent and not better explained by another disorder.\n\nNext, differential diagnoses. Bipolar I disorder with psychotic features could be considered, but she has a prior diagnosis of schizoaffective, which includes both mood and psychotic symptoms. Since she's off meds, it's likely a recurrence of that. Schizophrenia is another possibility, but the mood component in her history points more toward schizoaffective. Substance-induced psychosis should be ruled out, but there's no mention of substance use here. Given the pregnancy, postpartum psychosis could be a future risk, but she's only 20 weeks, so not postpartum yet. \n\nOther considerations include medication-induced movement disorders, but she's off meds, so that's less likely. Also, her agitation and resistance could be part of catatonia, which might warrant a separate catatonia diagnosis if severe enough. The suicide attempt history suggests ongoing risk, so maybe major depressive disorder could be in the differential, but the current presentation is more psychotic.\n\nPrioritizing the top five diagnoses. Primary is schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, with catatonia specifier. Then, catatonia associated with another mental disorder. Bipolar I disorder with psychotic features. Schizophrenia. And finally, major depressive disorder with psychotic features, though less likely given the bipolar type history.\n\nI need to ensure the ICD-10 codes are correct. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, is F25.0. Catatonia associated with another mental disorder is F06.1. Bipolar I disorder, current episode manic with psychotic features, would be F31.2. Schizophrenia is F20.9. Major depressive disorder with psychotic features is F32.3.\n\nWait, the vignette mentions medication nonadherence leading to acute worsening. So, the primary is likely schizoaffective disorder, currently psychotic. The catatonia is part of that presentation, so maybe listing schizoaffective with catatonia specifier first, then separate catatonia diagnosis? According to DSM-5, catatonia can be a specifier for several disorders, but if it's a focus of clinical attention, it can be listed separately. Here, it's mentioned as part of her presentation, so including it as a secondary diagnosis makes sense.\n\nAlso, considering her pregnancy, but no other medical issues mentioned, so likely no non-psychiatric diagnoses. The top five should all be psychiatric with F-codes. Let me list them in order of likelihood based on the vignette.",

    "vignette":"Ms. T is a 34-year-old female with no significant past psychiatric history. She presented to the emergency department due to one month of worsening mood, inability to care for herself, hyperreligiosity, auditory hallucinations, and perseveration on the idea that she is going to hell. The patient reported auditory hallucinations in which she heard the voices of Satan or Saints. She reported anergia, amotivation, anhedonia, decreased appetite, and difficulty falling and staying asleep. The patient also had new-onset superficial cutting of her wrists. She was perseverating on the idea that she had become an apostate and was therefore going to hell. The patient denied suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, or visual hallucinations. The patient's family history was relevant for a maternal grandmother with schizophrenia. After evaluation in the emergency department, acute inpatient psychiatric hospitalization was recommended. Ms. T signed herself into the psychiatric hospital voluntarily for her first hospitalization. The patient's parents reported that this behavior was unusual and abrupt and that she was previously sociable and well-liked by her peers. The patient's symptoms started within 3 weeks of the patient contracting COVID-19 which was confirmed via PCR. They deny any similar symptoms or similar behavior in the past.

    "model_thoughts":"First, I need to diagnose the clinical case vignette based on DSM-5-TR criteria. The patient, Ms. T, is a 34-year-old female with no significant past psychiatric history. Key symptoms include:\n\n- Worsening mood for one month.\n\n- Inability to care for herself.\n\n- Hyperreligiosity.\n\n- Auditory hallucinations (voices of Satan or Saints).\n\n- Perseveration on the idea that she is going to hell.\n\n- Anergia, amotivation, anhedonia, decreased appetite, insomnia (difficulty falling and staying asleep).\n\n- New-onset superficial cutting of her wrists.\n\n- Denies suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, or visual hallucinations.\n\n- Family history: maternal grandmother with schizophrenia.\n\n- Onset: symptoms started within 3 weeks of contracting COVID-19 (confirmed via PCR).\n\n- Behavior described as unusual and abrupt; previously sociable and well-liked.\n\n- Speech was childlike, as if regressed.\n\n- First psychiatric hospitalization.\n\nI must base my diagnosis only on the information provided and not fabricate details. I need to provide the top 5 most likely diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes: one primary diagnosis and four secondary diagnoses.\n\nI should follow the rubric for expert-level performance, but my response should only include the structured list of diagnoses and F-codes, without clinical reasoning. So, I'll internalize the reasoning but output only the list.\n\nNow, let's analyze the symptoms:\n\n- **Psychotic symptoms**: Auditory hallucinations, delusional thinking (perseveration on going to hell, hyperreligiosity). Also, possible disorganized speech or behavior? Speech is described as childlike, which might indicate disorganization or regression.\n\n- **Mood symptoms**: Anergia, amotivation, anhedonia, decreased appetite, insomnia \u2013 these are depressive symptoms. But the mood is worsening, and there's hyperreligiosity, which can be seen in mania or psychosis.\n\n- **Timeline**: One month of symptoms, abrupt onset post-COVID-19 infection.\n\n- **Risk factors**: Family history of schizophrenia.\n\n- **Self-harm**: Superficial cutting of wrists, but denies suicidal ideation. This could be non-suicidal self-injury or related to psychosis.\n\n- **No past psychiatric history**, so this is a first episode.\n\nConsidering DSM-5-TR, the presence of psychotic symptoms with mood symptoms suggests possible psychotic disorders or mood disorders with psychotic features.\n\nKey differentials:\n\n1. **Schizophrenia**: Requires at least 6 months of symptoms, but this is only one month. However, for schizophrenia, the active phase symptoms (like delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech) must be present for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period, but there's also a requirement for continuous signs for at least 6 months, including prodromal or residual symptoms. Here, it's only one month with no past history, so schizophrenia might not be the best fit unless we consider it as the beginning of the disorder. But the vignette says \"first hospitalization\" and symptoms for one month, so it could be early in the course.\n\n2. **Schizophreniform Disorder**: Similar to schizophrenia but duration is between 1 to 6 months. This fits better since symptoms have been present for one month, and if it persists, it could evolve. Criteria include psychotic symptoms for at least one month but less than six months.\n\n3. **Brief Psychotic Disorder**: Duration of psychotic symptoms is at least 1 day but less than 1 month, with eventual return to premorbid functioning. Here, symptoms are for one month, so it might be exactly one month, but brief psychotic disorder typically has a duration of less than one month. DSM-5-TR says \"duration of an episode of the disturbance is at least 1 day but less than 1 month, with eventual full return to premorbid level of functioning.\" Since it's one month, it might be borderline, but if it's exactly one month, it could be considered. However, the vignette says \"one month of worsening mood,\" and psychotic symptoms are part of that, so duration might be at or near one month.\n\n4. **Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features**: Depressive symptoms (anergia, anhedonia, etc.) with psychotic features like auditory hallucinations and delusions. The mood is worsening, and there are clear depressive symptoms.\n\n5. **Bipolar Disorder with Psychotic Features**: Hyperreligiosity can be a sign of mania, but other manic symptoms like elevated mood, increased energy aren't mentioned. There's anergia and amotivation, which are more depressive. So, might be a depressive episode with psychotic features, but bipolar disorder requires a history of mania or hypomania, which isn't reported here.\n\n6. **Substance\/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder**: But no substance use is mentioned. However, COVID-19 infection could be a medical condition triggering symptoms.\n\n7. **Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition**: Since symptoms started within 3 weeks of COVID-19, this is a strong possibility. COVID-19 has been associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms. The abrupt onset post-infection supports this.\n\n8. **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder**: Perseveration on ideas might suggest OCD, but with psychotic features, it's less likely. Hyperreligiosity can be seen in OCD, but auditory hallucinations are not typical.\n\n9. **Posttraumatic Stress Disorder**: No trauma mentioned.\n\n10. **Personality Disorder**: No long-term pattern described; this is an abrupt change.\n\nAlso, note the childlike speech and regression, which could indicate disorganized behavior or catatonia, but not explicitly stated.\n\nFamily history of schizophrenia increases risk for psychotic disorders.\n\nNow, for the list, I need the top 5 most likely diagnoses with F-codes.\n\nPrimary diagnosis should be the most likely based on the information.\n\nGiven the acute onset post-COVID-19, **Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition** seems plausible. But I need to check DSM-5-TR criteria: there is evidence that the disturbance is the direct pathophysiological consequence of another medical condition. Here, temporal relationship with COVID-19 infection.\n\nHowever, the symptoms include mood and psychotic features, so it could be a mood disorder due to another medical condition.\n\nDSM-5-TR has categories for psychotic disorders due to another medical condition and depressive disorders due to another medical condition.\n\nBut the prominent psychotic symptoms like auditory hallucinations and delusions, along with depressive symptoms, make it complex.\n\nPerhaps **Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features** is a strong candidate because of the depressive symptoms.\n\nBut the abrupt onset and association with COVID-19 might favor a medical etiology.\n\nAnother consideration: **Schizophreniform Disorder** given the duration of one month and psychotic symptoms.\n\nLet's prioritize based on likelihood:\n\n1. **Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (with hallucinations and delusions)** \u2013 This fits the temporal relationship with COVID-19, and no past history.\n\n2. **Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features** \u2013 Depressive symptoms are prominent, but the onset is abrupt and linked to COVID-19.\n\n3. **Schizophreniform Disorder** \u2013 Psychotic symptoms for one month, could be early schizophrenia.\n\n4. **Brief Psychotic Disorder** \u2013 If duration is exactly one month, it might be borderline, but possible.\n\n5. **Schizophrenia** \u2013 Less likely due to short duration, but family history and symptoms could indicate prodrome.\n\nBut I need to include only DSM-5-TR diagnoses with F-codes.\n\nAlso, the cutting behavior might suggest non-suicidal self-injury, but that's not a standalone diagnosis in DSM-5-TR; it's a symptom or part of another disorder.\n\nNow, for F-codes:\n\n- ICD-10 codes for psychiatric disorders.\n\nI need to assign specific F-codes based on the diagnosis.\n\nRecall common F-codes:\n\n- F20.x for schizophrenia spectrum disorders.\n\n- F23.x for brief psychotic disorder.\n\n- F25.x for schizoaffective disorder, but not sure if applicable.\n\n- F32.x for major depressive disorder.\n\n- F06.x for mental disorders due to known physiological condition.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- F06.2 Psychotic disorder due to known physiological condition.\n\n- F06.31 Depressive disorder due to known physiological condition with depressive features, or F06.32 with major depressive-like episode.\n\n- F20.9 Schizophrenia.\n\n- F20.81 Schizophreniform disorder.\n\n- F23 Brief psychotic disorder.\n\n- F32.3 Major depressive disorder, severe with psychotic features.\n\nAlso, for schizophreniform disorder, ICD-10 code is F20.81.\n\nFor brief psychotic disorder, F23.\n\nNow, to list the top 5:\n\nPrimary diagnosis: Most likely based on the vignette. The key points are acute onset post-COVID-19, psychotic and depressive symptoms, no past history. I think **Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition** is a strong candidate because of the clear temporal link.\n\nBut let's see the symptoms: auditory hallucinations, delusions, plus depressive symptoms. In DSM-5-TR, if the psychotic symptoms are predominant, it could be psychotic disorder due to another medical condition. If mood symptoms are predominant, it could be depressive disorder due to another medical condition.\n\nThe vignette says \"worsening mood\" and lists depressive symptoms, but the psychotic symptoms are also prominent. Hyperreligiosity and perseveration on hell could be delusional.\n\nPerhaps it's a mixed picture.\n\nAnother possibility: **Schizoaffective Disorder**, but for that, there must be a major mood episode concurrent with psychotic symptoms without mood symptoms, and here, mood symptoms are present throughout.\n\nBut for schizoaffective, the psychotic symptoms must be present for at least two weeks without prominent mood symptoms, which isn't clear here.\n\nGiven the abrupt onset and medical trigger, I'll prioritize the medical etiology.\n\nSo, primary: Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition.\n\nSecondary diagnoses: Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features, Schizophreniform Disorder, Brief Psychotic Disorder, and perhaps Schizophrenia or another related disorder.\n\nBut I need four secondary diagnoses.\n\nLet's list:\n\n1. Primary: Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (e.g., F06.2)\n\n2. Secondary: Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features (F32.3)\n\n3. Secondary: Schizophreniform Disorder (F20.81)\n\n4. Secondary: Brief Psychotic Disorder (F23)\n\n5. Secondary: Schizophrenia (F20.9) or perhaps Delusional Disorder, but less likely.\n\nDelusional Disorder might not fit because of hallucinations.\n\nAnother option: Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder, if it doesn't fit neatly.\n\nBut I think the above are reasonable.\n\nNow, for F-codes, I need to be precise.\n\n- F06.2 Psychotic disorder with hallucinations due to known physiological condition.\n\n- F32.3 Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe with psychotic symptoms \u2013 but here it's first episode, so F32.3 can be used for single episode as well, I think. In ICD-10, F32.3 is for severe depressive episode with psychotic symptoms.\n\n- F20.81 Schizophreniform disorder.\n\n- F23 Brief psychotic disorder; specify if with or without stressor, but code is F23.\n\n- F20.9 Schizophrenia, unspecified.\n\nI should use the exact ICD-10 codes as per DSM-5-TR correspondence.\n\nIn DSM-5-TR, diagnoses are listed with corresponding ICD-10 codes.\n\nFor Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition, ICD-10 code is F06.0 for psychotic disorder due to known physiological condition with delusions, or F06.2 with hallucinations. Here, both delusions and hallucinations are present, so F06.2 might be appropriate, or F06.0. DSM-5-TR uses F06.0 for delusions and F06.2 for hallucinations. Since hallucinations are reported, I'll use F06.2.\n\nBut in the vignette, auditory hallucinations are present, and delusions (perseveration on hell) might be present. So, F06.2 could be used.\n\nFor Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features, ICD-10 code is F32.3 for severe episode with psychotic symptoms.\n\nFor Schizophreniform Disorder, F20.81.\n\nFor Brief Psychotic Disorder, F23.9 for unspecified brief psychotic disorder.\n\nFor Schizophrenia, F20.9.\n\nNow, is there a better secondary? Perhaps Mood Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition, but I already have psychotic disorder due to medical condition.\n\nAnother possibility: Unspecified Psychotic Disorder, but I have more specific ones.\n\nI think this list covers the likely differentials.\n\nFinally, output only the list without reasoning.\n\nSo, structured list:\n\n1. Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (with hallucinations) - ICD-10 F06.2\n\n2. Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Severe With Psychotic Features - ICD-10 F32.3\n\n3. Schizophreniform Disorder - ICD-10 F20.81\n\n4. Brief Psychotic Disorder - ICD-10 F23\n\n5. Schizophrenia - ICD-10 F20.9\n\nI used \"Single Episode\" for MDD, but the vignette doesn't specify if recurrent, so F32.3 is for severe depressive episode with psychotic symptoms, which can be single.\n\nTo be accurate, since it's first episode, F32.3 is fine.\n\nNow, for brief psychotic disorder, ICD-10 code F23 requires specification, but I'll use F23 as the base code.\n\nIn practice, it might be F23.0 for acute polymorphic psychotic disorder without symptoms of schizophrenia, but not enough info. So, F23 is acceptable.\n\nSimilarly, for schizophrenia, F20.9 is unspecified.\n\nI think this is reasonable.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the clinical vignette to extract all relevant details. The patient is a young man with a military background, specifically a 6-month tour in Iraq where he experienced multiple traumatic events like incoming fire, ambushes, and an IED explosion injuring his colleagues. He's referred for suspected PTSD and depression.\n\nFirst, I need to organize the symptoms systematically. He has intrusive thoughts about the trauma daily, distressing memories, violent nightmares, and intense guilt related to the IED incident. Triggers like city streets or shooting ranges cause panic-like symptoms\u2014fear, anxiety, racing heart, shakiness. Avoidance behaviors are evident; he avoids reminders and is reluctant to discuss his history. Negative alterations in mood and cognition include feeling numb, withdrawn, difficulty sleeping, hypervigilance, startle response, angry outbursts, hopelessness, and concentration issues. He also mentions weight fluctuations and increased alcohol use\u201412 beers 2-3 times weekly.\n\nHe denies prior psychiatric issues before service, no mania, psychosis, or medical problems. There's a brief treatment history with an SSRI that was ineffective and missed therapy appointments. Childhood trauma is hinted at but not detailed.\n\nNow, considering DSM-5-TR criteria, the core symptoms align strongly with PTSD: exposure to traumatic events, intrusive symptoms, avoidance, negative alterations in mood\/cognition, arousal\/reactivity issues, duration more than a month, and functional impairment. The guilt over the IED incident is a key cognitive distortion typical in PTSD.\n\nNext, differential diagnoses. Depression is mentioned in the referral. He has hopelessness, sleep issues, concentration problems, weight changes\u2014meeting criteria for Major Depressive Disorder, especially since these persist and cause distress. However, some symptoms might overlap with PTSD, so MDD could be comorbid.\n\nAlcohol Use Disorder needs consideration. Drinking 12 beers 2-3 times a week exceeds moderate use. That's about 24-36 beers weekly, which is significant. He might be using alcohol to cope with PTSD symptoms, leading to a substance use disorder diagnosis.\n\nAdjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood is possible but less likely given the severity and specificity of PTSD symptoms. The trauma exposure and response seem more intense than an adjustment disorder.\n\nGiven the angry outbursts, hypervigilance, and irritability, Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder could be considered if PTSD criteria aren't fully met, but here they seem to align well.\n\nAlso, the early childhood trauma mentioned might contribute to a complex PTSD presentation, but DSM-5 doesn't separate it as a distinct diagnosis. Still, it could exacerbate symptoms.\n\nPrioritizing: PTSD is primary due to the clear trauma exposure and symptom clusters. MDD is secondary as comorbid depression is common. Alcohol Use Disorder is third given the excessive drinking. Other trauma-related disorders or adjustment issues are alternatives but less fitting. Avoid including non-psychiatric diagnoses as per instructions.",

    "vignette":"A 20-year-old woman was referred by her family physician to a community mental health team in London, United Kingdom. Her mental state had deteriorated progressively over the previous 12 months, following the death of her father. After a period living alone, she had returned to the family home 4 months prior to her presentation and had been noted to be socially withdrawn, preoccupied, and distractible. Her family physician, suspecting a depressive episode, had prescribed citalopram up to a dosage of 40 mg once daily, to no effect. Her family subsequently sought advice from the family physician when the patient was noted to be speaking to herself, expressing concerns about people meaning her harm, and professing the belief that she could hear other peoples\u2019 thoughts.\n\nThe patient had been born in Sierra Leone after a complicated delivery and had traveled to the United Kingdom as a child with her family, who were fleeing from a civil war. On arrival in the United Kingdom, her family claimed asylum and moved into a small apartment in a high-rise building in central London. Although there was no reported developmental delay, she had struggled academically at school and was bullied for having overweight. She left school without qualifications at age 16 years and worked as a shop assistant. She left this job about a year prior to her referral to psychiatry after a period of sick leave following the death of her father. She was a nonsmoker, did not drink alcohol, and denied illicit drug use. A paternal relative was reported to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia. There was no comorbid physical illness.\n\nOn review, the patient was kempt and had overweight. Eye contact was fleeting, and she presented as anxious, with a degree of psychomotor agitation. Her speech was normal in rate, volume, and tone, although tangential. There was no other evidence of thought disorder. She denied feeling low in mood or suicidal and was objectively euthymic. There was some sleep disturbance, with the patient reporting being fearful to go to sleep owing to persecutory beliefs regarding her neighbors. She reflected that over the preceding few months, she had experienced a sensation of detachment from her immediate environment, as though it was not real, making her world similar to that of a video game. She reported that in the apartment where she had previously been living, she had realized that something was amiss and had become convinced that the door number of her neighbor\u2019s flat, number 6, signified that they meant her harm. She explained this was because 6 was associated with the number of the devil. She reported hearing her neighbors commenting negatively about her appearance. These distressing experiences prompted her to return to her family home, but she continued to hear her neighbors\u2019 voices making derogatory comments about her appearance and began to hear them commenting on her actions and thoughts in the third person as well. On returning home, her paranoia regarding her previous neighbors worsened, resulting in her rarely leaving the house. The volume and frequency of derogatory auditory hallucinations also worsened, and she reported hearing the thoughts of others as well. There was a degree of insight, and although the patient was convinced of the reality of her experiences, she also saw the stress of losing her father as associated with her experiences and was accepting of input from mental health services.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, the user wants me to outline the thought process behind diagnosing the given clinical case. Let me start by carefully extracting all relevant information from the vignette.\n\nFirst, the patient is a 20-year-old woman with a progressive deterioration over 12 months after her father's death. Key symptoms include social withdrawal, preoccupation, distractibility, speaking to herself, persecutory beliefs, and auditory hallucinations. She also experiences derealization, describing her world as like a video game.\n\nI need to consider the DSM-5-TR criteria for each potential diagnosis. The primary symptoms point towards a psychotic disorder. The presence of delusions (persecutory and referential, like the neighbor's door number meaning harm), auditory hallucinations (derogatory comments, hearing others' thoughts), and disorganized thinking (tangential speech) are prominent.\n\nSchizophrenia seems likely because she has at least two of the required symptoms (delusions, hallucinations) lasting more than 6 months, with significant functional impairment. The timeline is over 12 months, which fits. Schizoaffective disorder might be considered but she denies mood symptoms and is euthymic, so mood episodes aren't prominent.\n\nSchizophreniform disorder is a possibility, but the duration exceeds 6 months, so schizophrenia takes precedence. Delusional disorder could be considered, but the presence of hallucinations and other symptoms rules it out. Brief psychotic disorder is unlikely due to the duration.\n\nTrauma-related disorders like PTSD are relevant given her history of fleeing civil war, but the core symptoms are psychotic rather than re-experiencing trauma. However, the stressor of her father's death might trigger psychotic features. Depressive episodes with psychotic features are less likely as she denies low mood and antidepressants were ineffective.\n\nSubstance-induced psychosis isn't supported since she denies drug use. Medical conditions should be ruled out, but no physical illnesses are reported. Her family history of schizophrenia increases the risk for primary psychotic disorders.\n\nOrganizing the differential: Schizophrenia is primary due to chronicity and symptom profile. Schizoaffective disorder is secondary but mood symptoms are absent. PTSD with psychotic features given trauma history. Persistent depressive disorder? Not fitting since she's euthymic. Avoidant personality due to social withdrawal and bullying history.\n\nFinalizing the list: Schizophrenia as primary, then schizoaffective, PTSD, delusional disorder, and avoidant personality as secondaries. Each matches DSM-5-TR criteria and ICD-10 codes accordingly.",

    "vignette":"A 29-year old man who is married and an employed Army veteran presented with headache from a mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) diagnosed before his Army discharge. He came to a Veterans Affairs hospital requesting buprenorphine\/naloxone and complained of marital problems and job absenteeism. His TBI occurred when a roadside bomb overturned his supply truck in Afghanistan. He lost consciousness during the bombing and awoke with severe head and neck pain but no radiological brain, spine, or skull damage or focal neurological signs. He was given 20 oral morphine (5 mg) tablets and consumed them in 4 days rather than the intended 2 weeks. After finishing the morphine, he mitigated his pain with alcohol and ibuprofen (400-800 mg daily).\n\nHis opioid and ibuprofen use for TBI headaches escalated during and after his time in the military despite repeated efforts to stop by using clonidine, which relieved his withdrawal symptoms, although a rapid clonidine with naltrexone detoxification failed. After consuming a 6-week supply of morphine (5 mg) from his family physician in 3 weeks, he started receiving morphine from multiple pain physicians for about a year and buying prescription opioids from a friend. When the prescription opioids became too expensive, he started using heroin intravenously. After using heroin for about a year, he survived a respiratory arrest from overdosing with heroin mixed with fentanyl. This almost fatal overdose and persistent headaches scared him into going to a Veterans Affairs hospital, wanting buprenorphine\/naloxone. His headaches had gotten worse since his injury 3 years ago, but new radiologic and neurologic examinations showed no abnormalities.",

    "vignette":"A 4-year-old boy was referred to the child psychiatry clinic for management of tantrums with aggression and self-injurious behavior. Tantrums were unpredictable and often resulted in severe head-butting. His parents also reported atypical social and language development, disrupted sleep, and persistent impulsivity with attempts to elope.\n\nThe patient had a complex medical history that was marked by prematurity at 32 weeks, slow postnatal growth, and severe gastroesophageal reflux. Genetic testing following an episode of hypoglycemia revealed microdeletion of the 16p11.2 region of chromosome 16. His pediatrician documented a normal neurological examination without dysmorphology or congenital anomalies.\n\nA developmental evaluation revealed delays in motor function and language development notable by age 2 years. He attended a 0 to 3 program with intensive speech therapy and then moved to a self-contained preschool classroom with a 1:1 staff-to-student ratio. He received school-based speech, occupational, and physical therapies. Testing results revealed clinically significant scores on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. Cognitive testing results showed that his IQ was below average but was likely an underestimate due to noncompliance. The parents stated that he played repetitively, lining up toy cars and spinning their wheels. He did not seek or give comfort to others when distressed. He had tactile hypersensitivity but pain hyposensitivity, flicked light switches repetitively, and mouthed objects.\n\nIn the office, the patient showed a minimal response to clinicians\u2019 social overtures and poor eye contact. He replayed videos on a smartphone while laughing, spinning around, and flapping his hands. He did not respond to prompts for joint engagement and no imaginative play was observed. When the videos stopped, he repeatedly climbed onto chairs and jumped off. As clinicians attempted to redirect him, he became very agitated and his mother intervened physically to protect him from self-injury.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the clinical vignette provided. The patient is a 4-year-old boy referred for tantrums with aggression and self-injurious behavior, like head-butting. There's also mention of atypical social and language development, disrupted sleep, impulsivity, and attempts to elope.\n\nFirst, I need to extract all relevant information systematically. The key symptoms include aggression, self-injury, social and language delays, repetitive behaviors (lining up toys, spinning wheels), poor eye contact, minimal response to social cues, and sensory issues like tactile hypersensitivity but pain hyposensitivity. Also, there's a genetic finding of 16p11.2 microdeletion, which is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nNow, organizing this data: The core issues seem to be in social communication, restrictive\/repetitive behaviors, and developmental delays. The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule results were clinically significant, which strongly points toward autism spectrum disorder. Additionally, the tantrums and aggression could be due to frustration or communication difficulties, common in ASD.\n\nConsidering differential diagnoses, besides ASD, I should think about other neurodevelopmental disorders. The genetic condition might contribute to the presentation, but ASD seems primary. The self-injurious behavior and impulsivity might also suggest conditions like ADHD, but in a 4-year-old, ADHD can be comorbid with ASD. The sleep disruption could be a separate issue or part of ASD.\n\nWait, the vignette mentions severe gastroesophageal reflux and prematurity, but these are medical history, not psychiatric diagnoses. So, I should focus on psychiatric conditions. The patient has significant developmental delays, so intellectual disability might be considered, especially since IQ testing was below average, though possibly underestimated.\n\nAlso, the repetitive behaviors and sensory issues align with ASD. The social deficits are clear: he doesn't seek comfort, poor eye contact, minimal response to social overtures. That's classic for ASD. The aggression and self-injury could be part of ASD with behavioral disturbances.\n\nWhat about other diagnoses? Maybe disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, but the age is a bit young, and the core symptoms are more neurodevelopmental. Anxiety disorders could be considered due to agitation, but the primary issue seems ASD. Oppositional defiant disorder might come to mind with aggression, but again, the social and communication deficits point more toward ASD.\n\nGenetic syndrome-associated disorders: since there's a known microdeletion, that could be coded as a separate condition if it's causing the psychiatric symptoms. But in DSM-5, ASD can be specified with a known genetic condition. So, I need to list ASD as primary, and then perhaps intellectual disability, ADHD, and maybe a code for the genetic condition if it's relevant.\n\nWait, the instruction says to give ICD-10 F-codes, so I need to use those. Also, only psychiatric diagnoses, no medical ones. So, the genetic condition might be listed if it's a psychiatric diagnosis, but 16p11.2 deletion syndrome isn't a psychiatric diagnosis per se; it's a genetic disorder. However, it can be associated with ASD and other neurodevelopmental issues.\n\nLooking back, the top five likely diagnoses: Autism Spectrum Disorder is the most prominent. Then, Intellectual Disability, given the developmental delays and below-average IQ. Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder due to impulsivity and attempts to elope. Also, possibly a disorder associated with the genetic condition, but since that's not a psychiatric diagnosis, maybe I should consider other behavioral disorders.\n\nPerhaps Stereotypic Movement Disorder because of the hand-flapping and repetitive behaviors, but that's already covered under ASD. Maybe Anxiety Disorder, but not enough info. Disruptive Behavior Disorder could be considered, but again, the aggression might be part of ASD.\n\nI think the primary is ASD, then Intellectual Disability, ADHD, and maybe Stereotypic Movement Disorder with self-injurious behavior. But the self-injury is part of the tantrums, so perhaps it's included in ASD. Alternatively, a separate diagnosis for the self-injurious behavior if it's severe enough, but DSM-5 might code it under ASD with behavioral symptoms.\n\nI need to check the ICD-10 codes: F84.0 for Autism Spectrum Disorder, F70-F79 for Intellectual Disability, F90.x for ADHD, and maybe F98.4 for Stereotypic Movement Disorder. Also, considering the genetic condition, but since it's not a psychiatric diagnosis, I shouldn't include it. The instruction says no non-psychiatric diagnoses without F-codes.\n\nWait, the vignette mentions clinically significant scores on ADOS, so ASD is confirmed. The developmental delays and low IQ point to Intellectual Disability. The impulsivity and elopement suggest ADHD. The self-injurious behavior could be part of ASD or a separate stereotypic movement disorder. Also, disrupted sleep might indicate a sleep-wake disorder, but not enough info.\n\nSo, my list: 1. Autism Spectrum Disorder, 2. Intellectual Disability, 3. Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder, 4. Stereotypic Movement Disorder, 5. Maybe Anxiety Disorder or Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, but not sure. Alternatively, Other Specified Neurodevelopmental Disorder if the genetic condition is considered, but that might be redundant.\n\nLet me reread the vignette. It says \"clinically significant scores on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule,\" so ASD is likely. Then, \"IQ was below average,\" so Intellectual Disability, but it says \"likely an underestimate,\" so maybe unspecified intellectual disability. The behavior includes impulsivity and elopement, which are ADHD symptoms. The repetitive behaviors like hand-flapping and lining up toys are part of ASD, but the self-injurious head-butting could be stereotypic movement disorder.\n\nIn DSM-5, stereotypic movement disorder can be diagnosed alongside ASD if the movements are severe enough. So, that might be a separate diagnosis. Also, the sleep disruption could be Insomnia Disorder, but not detailed enough. Perhaps Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder for the aggression, but again, it might be part of ASD.\n\nI think the top five are: Autism Spectrum Disorder, Intellectual Disability, ADHD, Stereotypic Movement Disorder, and maybe Anxiety Disorder Unspecified due to agitation, but the vignette doesn't explicitly mention anxiety. Alternatively, Unspecified Neurodevelopmental Disorder considering the genetic condition, but that might not be necessary.\n\nFinally, I need to format the response as numbered list with ICD-10 codes. So, primary: Autism Spectrum Disorder - F84.0. Then, secondary: Intellectual Disability - F79 (unspecified severity since it's not specified), ADHD - F90.9, Stereotypic Movement Disorder - F98.4, and maybe Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder - F34.8, but DMDD requires persistent irritability, which isn't explicitly stated. Alternatively, Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder - F91.8 for the aggression.\n\nLet me check the symptoms: tantrums with aggression, self-injury, impulsivity. Could be ODD, but the age is 4, and ODD typically requires a pattern of angry\/irritable mood, argumentative\/defiant behavior, or vindictiveness. Not clearly stated here. So, maybe not. \n\nI think Stereotypic Movement Disorder is appropriate because of the hand-flapping, spinning, and self-injurious head-butting. So, that should be included. For the fifth, perhaps Unspecified Anxiety Disorder due to the agitation, but it's a bit vague. Alternatively, since the genetic condition is known, maybe Other Specified Neurodevelopmental Disorder associated with a known medical condition, but that might be redundant with ASD.\n\nLooking at the DSM-5, ASD can be specified with accompanying intellectual impairment and with accompanying genetic condition. So, maybe the genetic condition doesn't need a separate code. But the instruction says to list psychiatric diagnoses with F-codes, so I'll stick to that.\n\nI'll go with: 1. Autism Spectrum Disorder, 2. Intellectual Disability, 3. Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder, 4. Stereotypic Movement Disorder, 5. Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder for the aggression and tantrums not better explained by ASD.\n\nYeah, that seems reasonable. Now, for the codes: F84.0, F79, F90.9, F98.4, F91.8. I need to make sure the codes are correct. ICD-10 F84.0 is for autistic disorder, which is equivalent to ASD. F79 is unspecified intellectual disability. F90.9 is unspecified ADHD. F98.4 is stereotypic movement disorder. F91.8 is other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder.\n\nI should double-check if there's a better code for the aggression. Maybe F91.3 for oppositional defiant disorder, but again, not enough criteria. So, F91.8 might be appropriate. Alternatively, F43.23 for adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct, but no clear stressor mentioned.\n\nI think the list is solid. Now, to present it without clinical reasoning, just the diagnoses and codes.",

    "model_thoughts":"Hmm, this is a complex clinical vignette requiring careful analysis. The patient presents with multiple neurological and psychiatric symptoms over a 4-week period. Let me break down the key features systematically.\n\nFirst, the neurological symptoms are prominent: severe weakness, difficulty ambulating, numbness\/tingling in extremities, calf muscle atrophy, hyperreflexia, and Babinski sign. These suggest both peripheral and central nervous system involvement. The mental status exam shows memory impairment with delayed recall issues.\n\nThe lab findings are crucial - macrocytic anemia (high MCV) with low hemoglobin. This immediately points toward possible B12 deficiency, which can cause both neurological and psychiatric manifestations. The GI symptoms (nausea, bloating, anorexia) further support malabsorption as a potential cause.\n\nFor psychiatric diagnosis, the cognitive impairment is key. The memory issues combined with neurological symptoms in an older adult suggest major neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition. Given the timeline and lab findings, B12 deficiency encephalopathy seems most likely. The patient meets criteria for major neurocognitive disorder with behavioral disturbance given the functional impairment.\n\nI need to consider other possibilities too. The neurological symptoms could indicate other conditions like peripheral neuropathy or spinal cord issues, but the macrocytic anemia strongly points toward nutritional deficiency. The memory impairment could be early dementia, but the acute progression and associated symptoms make it more likely due to a medical condition.\n\nFor the structured list, the primary diagnosis should be the neurocognitive disorder due to B12 deficiency. Secondary diagnoses should cover the neurological manifestations and other possible psychiatric conditions that could explain the symptoms. I'll prioritize based on likelihood and clinical relevance.",

The headaches became less severe after the patient took acetaminophen. He had no associated nausea, vomiting, or neck pain.\nTwo weeks before the current presentation, paresthesia developed in the fingertips and, over the course of several days, extended to the hands and then the forearms. One week before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. The temporal temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 134\/82 mm Hg, the heart rate 92 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.9. He had no rash. Sensation to light touch and pinprick was absent from the toes to the midfoot.\nScreening tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and C viruses, and Lyme disease were negative.

Testing for anti\u2013myelin-associated glycoprotein antibodies was negative. Imaging studies were obtained.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed. T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, obtained before the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed mild, nonspecific, scattered foci of hyperintensity involving the supratentorial white matter; the dominant lesion, which was located in the right frontal centrum semiovale and corona radiata, measured 1.4 cm in diameter. No associated abnormal enhancement was seen on images obtained after the administration of contrast material.\nThe patient was referred to a neurology clinic. One week later, while the patient was awaiting an appointment in the neurology clinic, paresthesia extended into the thighs and torso. The patient was advised by his primary care physician to present to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported worsening paresthesia and loss of dexterity in his hands. He was no longer able to play guitar. He had no motor weakness, bowel or bladder incontinence, or double vision. There was no change in sensation in his face or in articulation of his speech, and he had no dysphonia, dysphagia, or shortness of breath.\nOther medical history included depression and chronic knee and ankle pain after trauma. Medications included bupropion and mirtazapine. There were no known allergies. The patient was a graduate student and lived with several roommates. He was sexually active with women. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for 11 years before quitting 4 years before the current presentation. He had consumed three alcoholic drinks daily for many years, but 1 month before the current presentation, he had reduced consumption to two drinks one or two times per week. He used intranasal cocaine three or four times per week and inhaled nitrous oxide once per week. He had last used lysergic acid diethylamide and ketamine 10 weeks before the current presentation during a camping trip in rural New England; there were ticks in the area where he had camped, but he had not found any ticks on his body.

The key here is to focus only on the psychiatric diagnoses that can be inferred from the data, as per the instructions. \n\nFirst, I need to extract relevant psychiatric information from the vignette. The patient has a history of depression and is currently on bupropion and mirtazapine. There's mention of a flat affect during the examination. Additionally, there's significant substance use: intranasal cocaine three to four times per week, inhaled nitrous oxide once per week, and past use of LSD and ketamine. The alcohol use is notable too, with recent reduction from three drinks daily to two drinks once or twice weekly. \n\nThe neurological symptoms are prominent, but for DSM-5-TR, I should consider substance-related disorders, depressive disorders, and any other psychiatric conditions that fit. The flat affect and history of depression point toward a depressive disorder. The substance use patterns clearly indicate substance use disorders, especially with cocaine and nitrous oxide, and possibly alcohol. \n\nI must avoid including neurological diagnoses since the user specified only psychiatric diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes. The primary diagnosis should be the most significant psychiatric condition.

The substance use is frequent and regular, warranting Substance Use Disorders. Nitrous oxide use isn't a standard DSM-5 substance, but it falls under Other (or Unknown) Substance Use Disorder. Cocaine and Alcohol Use Disorders are clear. The reduction in alcohol use might indicate remission, but since it's recent, I'll list it as active. \n\nThe list should prioritize the most impactful psychiatric conditions.

    "vignette":"A 27-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of convulsions.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 2 years before this admission, when shaking of the trunk, arms, and legs occurred. The episode lasted approximately 4 to 5 minutes and had been preceded by a sharp pain in the back of the head that radiated to the neck, blurred vision, palpitations, nausea, and difficulty concentrating. The patient did not seek evaluation, and no additional convulsive episodes occurred during the subsequent 20 months.\nFour months before this admission, while the patient was drinking alcohol at a party, his body suddenly became stiff, and he fell backward onto a table. Shaking of the trunk, arms, and legs occurred for approximately 5 to 8 minutes. He had urinary incontinence but did not bite his tongue. Five minutes later, similar convulsions occurred. The patient was taken to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. The results of computed tomography of the head were normal, as was an electroencephalogram (EEG) that was obtained over a period of 40 minutes. Treatment with levetiracetam was started. The patient was discharged home with a recommendation for follow-up evaluation at the neurology clinic of the other hospital.\nThree months before this admission, the patient was evaluated at the neurology clinic of the other hospital. He reported that despite the use of levetiracetam, convulsions occurred approximately once per week. The results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, were reportedly normal. Treatment with lamotrigine was started. There was no change in the quality or frequency of the convulsive episodes.\nOne month before this admission, while the patient was at work, his colleagues found him on the floor, and they witnessed \u201cshaking and clenching\u201d movements of the trunk, arms, and legs that lasted approximately 2 minutes. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was taken to the emergency department of a second hospital for evaluation.\nAt least two additional convulsive episodes occurred at the second hospital. During one episode, the shaking movements became less intense when the physician\u2019s hand was placed on the patient\u2019s shoulder; the movements resumed at the previous intensity when the hand was removed. In addition, the patient\u2019s eyes were closed. When the eyelids were opened manually, no nystagmus or gaze deviation was present. When the eyelids were released, the eyes shut forcefully and Bell\u2019s phenomenon (upward deviation of the eyes when closing) occurred. The patient did not speak but was able to follow simple verbal commands, such as an instruction to squeeze the physician\u2019s hands. In between the convulsive episodes, there were intermittent rocking movements of the upper body and nonrhythmic tremulous movements of the hands, and the patient did not speak or follow commands. After several hours, the episodes stopped, and the patient was able to speak. Admission to the hospital was recommended; however, the patient declined because of work obligations and anxiety about being in the hospital. He was discharged home.\nDuring the subsequent month, the patient continued to take levetiracetam and lamotrigine. However, the convulsions increased in frequency to one to three times per week.\nOn the morning before the current admission, while the patient was at work, his colleagues noticed that he abruptly stopped speaking and began to have shaking movements of the arms and legs. Emergency medical services were called. On their arrival, the patient\u2019s body was stiff, and there was twitching of the trunk, arms, and legs. No urinary or fecal incontinence or biting of the tongue had occurred. The patient was able to stand up from a chair and walk to the ambulance. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 111\/56 mm Hg, the pulse 83 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was awake and alert but did not speak. His eyes were open, with a primary midline gaze and blinking in response to visual threat. His body appeared stiff, with the arms and legs straightened. There were intermittent nonrhythmic tremulous movements of the trunk, arms, and legs. The patient was able to follow complex commands and to move the arms and legs symmetrically and against gravity, but there was a delay in motor activation. The deep-tendon reflexes were normal. Extensive scarring from burns was present on the face, trunk, back, arms, and legs.\nApproximately 45 minutes after the tremulous movements had stopped, the patient was able to speak but with limited fluency. Additional history was obtained. He had been taking levetiracetam and lamotrigine as directed; however, 3 days before this evaluation, he had stopped taking these medications because he was unsure whether they were effective. That morning, he had felt well until he noticed a sharp pain in the back of his head that radiated to his neck, along with sudden blurred vision, full-body numbness, and difficulty concentrating. A convulsive episode then occurred that lasted up to 20 minutes; during the episode, the patient was aware of events but sometimes had difficulty hearing. He described his overall mood as \u201cpretty good\u201d and did not report decreased energy or chronic fatigue. There was no history of psychotic or manic symptoms, suicidal ideation, or obsessive or compulsive behaviors.\nThe patient had a history of a febrile seizure in childhood, as well as several concussions that had occurred while he was playing sports in childhood. He reported that during the first 6 years of life, his social supports were limited, and he had experienced maltreatment by a family member; he did not elaborate on the nature of the maltreatment. In late childhood, he was involved in a house fire and hospitalized for a prolonged period because of severe burns on the face, body, arms, and legs. He had asthma, major depressive disorder, chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and panic disorder with agoraphobia. He took escitalopram daily and lorazepam as needed for panic attacks. He was in a long-term romantic relationship. He did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs; he smoked marijuana approximately once per year and drank one alcoholic beverage per week. His father had died of heart disease when the patient was a teenager; his mother had schizoaffective disorder and post-traumatic epilepsy.\nBlood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The blood lactate level was 2.4 mmol per liter (22 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.2 mmol per liter [5 to 20 mg per deciliter]) and the blood creatine kinase level 489 U per liter (reference range, 60 to 400). Serum and urine toxicologic panels were negative. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was admitted to this hospital.",

    "vignette":"A 49-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of hypokalemia and paranoid thoughts.\nSix months before the current admission, discomfort on the right side of the chest developed, and the patient was evaluated at another hospital.\nComputed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a nodule in the upper lobe of the left lung that measured 2.1 cm by 1.9 cm, as well as bulky mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.\nAn endobronchial ultrasound\u2013guided transbronchial needle aspiration of a mediastinal lymph node was performed. Cytologic examination of the specimen revealed small-cell carcinoma.\nFive months before the current admission, the patient sought a second opinion in the oncology clinic of this hospital. The patient was counseled about the diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer and the need for additional imaging before consideration of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy. Additional imaging was scheduled, along with a follow-up appointment. The patient did not undergo additional imaging and did not attend follow-up visits at the oncology clinic of either this hospital or the other hospital.\nSix weeks before the current admission, the patient noticed swelling of both legs. Ten days before this admission, the swelling had not abated, and he was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital.\nIn the emergency department, the patient described himself as generally healthy and did not report any chronic health conditions. He reported no fever, chills, shortness of breath, or pain. Additional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s brother. The patient had been pursuing alternative treatment for small-cell lung cancer that included a strict diet and intravenous infusions, and he had not shared the diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer with his family until several days earlier. The patient\u2019s brother believed that the patient was in denial about the diagnosis.\nWhen the patient was 12 years of age, he had received a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, which had been treated with radiation therapy and splenectomy. Fifteen years before this presentation, ischemic colitis had been treated with small-bowel resection. One year before this presentation, deep-vein thrombosis had been treated with a 4-month course of anticoagulation. There was no history of psychiatric disease. He took no medications and had no known drug allergies; he did not disclose details about the infusions that he had received as alternative treatment for small-cell lung cancer. The patient lived in a suburban area of New England with his parents. He was divorced and frequently visited his children. He worked part-time as a skilled tradesman. Family members reported that he was a lifelong nonsmoker.\nThe temporal temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 167\/95 mm Hg, the pulse 80 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The patient was alert and appeared well, but he looked thinner than he had looked during his evaluation at the oncology clinic 5 months earlier. The abdomen had a healed surgical scar, and the legs had symmetric 1+ edema. The blood potassium level was 2.6 mmol per liter (reference range, 3.6 to 5.1); the white-cell count was 14,630 per microliter (reference range, 4000 to 11,000). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Ultrasonography of the legs revealed no evidence of deep-vein thrombosis.\nCT pulmonary angiography of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a marked increase in the size of the left-lung mass, which now measured 9.3 cm by 4.6 cm, as well as enlargement of the mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed numerous new ill-defined rim-enhancing hepatic lesions, which measured up to 8.0 cm in diameter; an adrenal mass, which measured 4.1 cm by 3.4 cm; and thrombosis of the branches of the right portal vein. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was normal.\nSupplemental potassium was administered intravenously and orally, and the patient was admitted to this hospital. During the next 3 days, additional supplemental potassium was administered. During follow-up interviews, the patient acknowledged the diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer, but he did not explain why he had not shared the diagnosis with his family or provide details about the alternative treatment that he had pursued. On the fourth hospital day, the blood potassium level increased, and the patient asked to go home. He stated that he was willing to attend follow-up visits at the oncology clinic, but he was evasive when chemotherapy and immunotherapy were discussed. The patient was discharged.\nOne week after discharge, and 1 day before the current admission, the patient\u2019s father accompanied the patient to receive massage therapy and an intravenous infusion as alternative treatment. During the infusion, the patient abruptly became volatile, agitated, and angry. On the drive home, he refused to close the window and stared into the distance. He stated that doctors had cast spells on him during his recent hospitalization and that he had killed his oldest child, which was not true.\nThe next day, the patient borrowed his brother\u2019s car without permission and drove across the state. After he returned home, family members brought the patient to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient stated that he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d for being in the hospital. He initially reported no symptoms, but on specific questioning, he acknowledged fatigue, weight loss, generalized weakness, decreased appetite, and ongoing leg swelling. He reported that he did not feel confused, afraid, or worried and that he had no suicidal or homicidal thoughts or auditory or visual hallucinations. Additional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s family members. The patient had not slept for several days. His aggressive and erratic behavior and delusions were not typical, although he could become easily angered and had a long-standing belief that his doctors had administered radiation therapy for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma to make money.\nThe temporal temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the blood pressure 194\/106 mm Hg, and the pulse 87 beats per minute. The patient alternated between being alert and lethargic, and he could state the names of his children but not their ages. He was cooperative but intermittently paused and stared; he was not distracted by external stimuli, but he seemed to be responding to internal stimuli. He spoke only a couple of words at a time and answered most questions by nodding or shaking his head. There was generalized weakness, which was most pronounced in the proximal muscle groups. The leg edema was unchanged, and the skin appeared abnormally tan; there was no scleral icterus, sublingual jaundice, or asterixis.\nThe blood potassium level was 2.2 mmol per liter, the carbon dioxide level 37 mmol per liter (reference range, 22 to 32), and the ammonia level 51 \u03bcmol per liter (87 \u03bcg per deciliter; reference range, 12 to 48 \u03bcmol per liter [20 to 82 \u03bcg per deciliter]). The white-cell count was 13,530 per microliter. Urinalysis was normal, and urine and blood toxicologic testing was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, was normal. Supplemental potassium was administered intravenously and orally, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. On the second hospital day, the blood potassium level was 2.2 mmol per liter.",

    "vignette":"A 65-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of depression, recurrent falls, and difficulty caring for herself.\nFour years before the current admission, the patient received a diagnosis of depression that was precipitated by psychosocial stressors. She was treated with bupropion, citalopram, and cognitive behavioral therapy. The depression was well controlled until 1 year before the current admission, when she began to have anhedonia, decreased energy, sadness, and poor concentration. She resumed cognitive behavioral therapy, but her symptoms worsened during the next 4 months, and she had suicidal ideation. The dose of bupropion was increased, and treatment with trazodone was started.\nFourteen weeks before the current admission, the patient was in a motor vehicle accident that was attributed to her falling asleep while driving. After the accident, she reported increased sadness, low energy, and inability to perform her usual activities. One week later, she fell and struck her head, and she was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital. She reported that, before her fall, she had been feeling unsteady because of weakness in the left leg. A physical examination was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed hypodensities involving the subcortical and periventricular white matter, findings consistent with chronic small-vessel disease. The patient was referred to the neurology clinic of this hospital and was discharged home.\nDuring the next week, the patient had balance difficulties and began using a walker. When she was evaluated in the neurology clinic, she reported imbalance and occasional nausea. On examination, she had a depressed affect. Strength was assessed as 5\u2212\/5 in the proximal and distal muscles of the arms and legs. Reflexes were 1+ and symmetric at the biceps, triceps, and patellar tendons and were absent at the ankles, with downgoing toes. The gait was wide-based and unsteady, with mild dragging of the left leg. A diagnosis of postconcussive syndrome was considered, and treatment with ondansetron was started for nausea. Additional tests were performed.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed increased signal intensity in the pons and in a periventricular distribution on T2-weighted imaging, without associated contrast enhancement. There was a region of decreased signal intensity in the right corona radiata on a map of the apparent diffusion coefficient. Results of electroencephalography were normal, as were results of electromyography and nerve-conduction studies of the left leg. Physical therapy was recommended, and repeat MRI was planned for 6 weeks later.\nOver the next 6-week period, during sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy, the patient was noted to be less talkative, with slow processing, impaired recall, and mild inattention. Repeat MRI with angiography performed 6 weeks after the first study revealed patchy hyperintensity involving the centrum semiovale, corona radiata, internal capsule, and corticospinal tract bilaterally on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging, without contrast enhancement; the cerebral vasculature was normal.\nThe patient had recurrent falls without loss of consciousness and began using a wheelchair. She reported worsening sadness, anxiety, and anhedonia, and treatment with buspirone was started. On evaluation in the neurology clinic 6 weeks before the current admission, testing of leg strength yielded inconsistent results, but strength in both legs was assessed as 5\u2212\/5 with maximum effort. Dragging of the left leg was also noted to be inconsistent. There were concerns that her depression might be contributing to her neurologic changes, and further follow-up with the psychiatric service was recommended.\nFive weeks before the current admission, the patient\u2019s husband brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for an evaluation of worsening memory impairment, poor self-care, and frequent falls. The patient had stopped participating in physical therapy and was spending most of the day in bed. She reported that she had lost 14 kg during the previous 4 months. Other medical history included hypertension, diabetes, and osteoarthritis of the knees. There was a history of postpartum depression 27 years earlier that had lasted for several months. Medications included amlodipine, buspirone, bupropion, cholecalciferol, citalopram, metformin, and trazodone. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with her husband in a suburb of Boston and worked as a teacher. She was a lifelong nonsmoker, drank alcohol only occasionally, and did not use illicit drugs. Her mother had a history of anxiety and depression in her seventh decade of life. Her sister had a history of stroke.\nOn examination, the patient appeared tired and disheveled, with psychomotor retardation. Strength in both legs was assessed as 5\/5. She had a monoplegic gait, with buckling of the left leg, when walking down a hallway, but she had a normal gait when walking on a treadmill. Her score on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment was 25, indicating mild cognitive impairment; scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function. The complete blood count, results of liver-function and kidney-function tests, and blood levels of cobalamin, thyrotropin, and electrolytes were normal. Screening for syphilis, Lyme disease, and the human immunodeficiency virus was negative, as was urine toxicologic screening. After an evaluation by a neurology consultant, the patient was voluntarily admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit.\nWhile the patient was in the hospital, the dose of citalopram was tapered, and treatment with desvenlafaxine and amphetamine\u2013dextroamphetamine was started; her levels of attention and wakefulness increased. She participated in group psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and occupational and physical therapy. She continued to have variable weakness in the left leg and had three witnessed falls, during which she reportedly had fatigue and lowered herself to the ground.\nOn hospital day 11, the patient reported being unable to use her left arm because of weakness. Although her left arm rested across her chest for most of the day, she was observed holding her husband\u2019s hand with her left hand when saying goodbye. On evaluation by a neurology consultant, strength in the left arm was assessed as 5\/5. The working diagnosis was functional neurologic disorder. On hospital day 12, the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation center.\nAt the rehabilitation center, the patient received physical, occupational, and speech therapy, as well as medications to treat depression. During the first week, she made progress toward independence in bathing, toileting, and grooming but had limited attention, memory, and problem solving. During the second week, she became more withdrawn. There was a paucity of speech with hypophonia, decreased attention, and less eye contact with visitors who sat on her left side than with visitors who sat on her right side. During the third week, the patient stopped answering questions and following commands. She was evaluated again in the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 141\/90 mm Hg, the pulse 98 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was withdrawn and minimally interactive. She was able to state her name but not the date or location. She did not blink in response to threat on the left side and did not track the examiner\u2019s finger past the midline to the left. There was flattening of the left nasolabial fold. The left arm was hypertonic and held in flexion; there was no spontaneous movement of the left arm or leg, and she declined to participate in a strength examination. She did not withdraw the left arm in response to nail-bed pressure; she withdrew the left foot with antigravity movement in response to tactile stimulation.\nThe white-cell count was 12,940 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), with a normal differential count. The remainder of the complete blood count was normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests and blood levels of electrolytes.",

Major depressive disorder is evident given the anhedonia, low energy, and suicidal ideation.

The anxiety symptoms warrant an unspecified anxiety disorder diagnosis. \n\nThe neurological findings like left-sided neglect and hypertonia point toward a possible stroke or other neurological condition, but the inconsistency and functional overlay make it less likely as the primary issue.

    "vignette":"A 54-year-old man was evaluated by the neuropsychology service of this hospital because of irritability, confusion, and odd behaviors.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 9 months before the current evaluation, when he received a diagnosis of squamous-cell carcinoma of the tongue that had metastasized to the cervical lymph nodes. He underwent surgical dissection of the neck and resection of the tongue base on the right side, followed by adjuvant radiation therapy, which resulted in cancer remission. After treatment, neck pain and shoulder weakness developed and was attributed to postoperative neuropathy involving the right spinal accessory nerve.\nIn the context of this illness and persistent pain, the patient sought care at the cancer center behavioral medicine clinic of this hospital and received a diagnosis of adjustment disorder with depression and anxiety. During the next 8 months, the patient was seen for psychotherapy approximately every 2 weeks. Treatment for the pain included physical therapy, occupational therapy, massage therapy, acupuncture, trigger-point injections, and the use of a scapular elevation brace. Therapy with oxycodone, methadone, gabapentin, tizanidine, and duloxetine was started. Four months before the current evaluation, a sural nerve graft was placed in the right spinal accessory nerve from the proximal, functioning portion to the distal portion, but the pain and weakness did not abate.\nSix weeks before the current evaluation, the patient did not respond to telephone calls for 24 hours. The police were called and found the patient unresponsive with prescription medication bottles nearby. Emergency medical services personnel arrived, and the initial evaluation, in the patient\u2019s home, was notable for a severely decreased respiratory rate. Naloxone was administered, the trachea was intubated, and the patient was taken to a local hospital. In the emergency department, the patient was pulseless with ongoing electrocardiographic activity. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed, and epinephrine was administered; after 4 minutes, spontaneous circulation was restored. The dose of methadone was decreased, and therapy with oxycodone, gabapentin, and tizanidine was stopped. During the subsequent 6 days, septic shock, aspiration pneumonia, acute kidney injury, and delirium occurred. When these problems resolved, the patient was discharged home.\nFive weeks before the current evaluation, the patient participated in a video follow-up evaluation at the behavioral medicine clinic. He expressed embarrassment and frustration related to his apparent accidental overdose. He described persistent depression, increased anxiety, and no other new symptoms.\nTwo weeks before the current evaluation, the patient missed a routine video follow-up evaluation at the behavioral medicine clinic, and his family was called. For the preceding 2 weeks, they had noticed that the patient was uncharacteristically agitated, irritable, talking loudly, and verbally abusive. Odd behaviors were reported. The patient had gotten lost while driving to a friend\u2019s house that he visited frequently, had been pulled over by police for driving erratically (with normal results on a breathalyzer test), and on another occasion, had been found walking along the highway under an overpass. He called family members repeatedly in the middle of the night, and he would not answer when the calls were returned. When the family requested a police wellness check of the patient, the patient retaliated by requesting a police wellness check of the family members. After this incident, the family was advised to take the patient to a local hospital for admission.\nAt the local hospital, the patient reported no symptoms and noted that he had stopped taking methadone because he was concerned about a medication overdose. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 19, indicating cognitive impairment; scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function.1 Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a nonspecific hypodensity in the centrum semiovale on the left side. The patient was told he had mild dementia. Visiting nurse services were arranged, and the patient was discharged home.\nOne week before the current evaluation, the patient\u2019s family reported that he had increased confusion and odd behaviors. He was unable to recall details of conversations that had happened minutes before. He could not operate the telephone or remote control and had emptied the trash can into the toilet. He had asked for his clothes to be cut off because he felt uncomfortable. Family members had been staying with the patient every night since his recent discharge because they were concerned about his safety. A neuropsychological evaluation was requested.\nThe evaluation was conducted by the cancer center neuropsychology service of this hospital with the use of videoconferencing technology to reduce the risk of exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). The patient acknowledged only minimal cognitive changes and was dismissive of the family\u2019s concerns. A review of systems was notable for fatigue, moderate depression, mild anxiety, and difficulty sleeping and keeping track of time.\nAdditional history obtained from the patient\u2019s family included insomnia, lumbar disk herniation, olecranon bursitis, and an inguinal hernia that had led to surgical repair in early adulthood. He had had multiple concussions as a teenager, as well as a brief loss of consciousness during a motor vehicle collision 3 years earlier. After the collision, fatigue, headaches, difficulty concentrating, and impaired memory occurred; during the subsequent 2 years, occupational therapy was provided, and the symptoms gradually resolved.\nMedications at the time of evaluation included ibuprofen, acetaminophen, duloxetine, trazodone, melatonin, polyethylene glycol, and multivitamins. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived alone in a suburban area of New England with family members nearby. He had completed a master\u2019s degree and had had a successful career; he had taken a leave of absence from work 9 months earlier in anticipation of cancer treatment. After cancer treatment, he had been unable to return to work because of pain. He was athletic, walked 3 miles daily, and enjoyed golfing. He rarely drank alcohol and had never smoked tobacco or used illicit drugs. His family history included breast cancer and dementia in his mother, hearing loss and hypertension in his father, metastatic cancer with an unknown primary source in his paternal grandfather, glaucoma and alcohol use disorder in his maternal grandmother, and a brain tumor in a more distant relative.\nOn video neuropsychological examination, the patient was in no distress and was adequately groomed, with normal-appearing hygiene. His affect was irritable, and the fact that he reported no symptoms suggested limited insight. His spontaneous speech was fluent and well articulated. His thoughts were tangential, and he was frequently forgetful and easily distracted; his information processing speed was slow. A formal neuropsychological assessment revealed impaired executive functioning, marked by disinhibition and poor working memory, as well as deficits in recent memory, verbal fluency, and information processing speed.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the clinical case vignette. The patient is a 54-year-old man with a history of squamous-cell carcinoma of the tongue, treated with surgery and radiation. After treatment, he developed neck pain and shoulder weakness, leading to a diagnosis of adjustment disorder with depression and anxiety. He was on multiple medications including oxycodone, methadone, gabapentin, tizanidine, and duloxetine.\n\nSix weeks before evaluation, he had an apparent accidental overdose requiring CPR and hospitalization, leading to septic shock, pneumonia, acute kidney injury, and delirium. After recovery, he was discharged but later developed increasing irritability, confusion, and odd behaviors\u2014getting lost, erratic driving, walking on the highway, and memory issues. His Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 19, indicating cognitive impairment. CT head showed a nonspecific hypodensity in the left centrum semiovale. Neuropsychological testing revealed impaired executive function, disinhibition, poor working memory, deficits in recent memory, verbal fluency, and slow processing speed.\n\nGiven the timeline\u2014symptoms starting after cancer treatment and overdose, with cognitive decline, behavioral changes, and neuropsychological deficits\u2014the primary issue seems to be neurocognitive. The key features are subacute onset of cognitive impairment, behavioral disinhibition, irritability, and executive dysfunction. The history of cancer and possible hypoxia from overdose complicate things, but the progression suggests a neurodegenerative or secondary cognitive disorder.\n\nFirst, considering the cognitive and behavioral changes, Major Neurocognitive Disorder (Dementia) is likely. The patient has significant impairment in memory, executive function, and daily activities (e.g., unable to operate phone, disorganized behavior). The Montreal Cognitive Assessment score of 19 supports this.\n\nBut what type? Given the behavioral symptoms\u2014irritability, disinhibition, agitation\u2014Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder (FTD) comes to mind. The patient's preserved language fluency but poor judgment and executive dysfunction align with behavioral variant FTD. However, the history of cancer and hypoxia might point to other etiologies.\n\nVascular Neurocognitive Disorder is possible due to the CT finding of hypodensity in the centrum semiovale, which could indicate ischemic changes. The patient's history of hypertension (in father) might contribute, but no direct history of strokes is mentioned.\n\nNeurocognitive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition needs consideration. The patient had a recent overdose with hypoxia, which can cause hypoxic brain injury leading to cognitive deficits. Also, the cancer history raises the possibility of paraneoplastic or metastatic effects, but the cancer is in remission.\n\nAdjustment Disorder was previously diagnosed, but the current symptoms exceed that, though it might still be present as a secondary issue.\n\nSubstance\/Medication-Induced Neurocognitive Disorder is possible given the multiple medications (opioids, gabapentin, duloxetine) and the overdose. However, many medications were stopped after the overdose, and symptoms persisted or worsened.\n\nDelirium should be ruled out. The patient had delirium during hospitalization, but the current symptoms are progressive over weeks, not fluctuating acutely, making delirium less likely as the primary issue now.\n\nPersonality Change Due to Another Medical Condition could fit given the marked personality and behavioral changes post-medical events.\n\nSo, prioritizing:\n1. Major Neurocognitive Disorder due to multiple etiologies (vascular, hypoxic, possible FTD) but given behavioral prominence, FTD might be primary. However, DSM-5-TR requires specifying probable etiology. The behavioral variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder seems fitting.\n2. Vascular Neurocognitive Disorder due to CT findings and cognitive deficits.\n3. Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Hypoxic Brain Injury from overdose.\n4. Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood, as initially diagnosed and still present.\n5. Personality Change Due to Another Medical Condition, considering the irritability and disinhibition.\n\nI need to ensure the ICD-10 codes are correct. For Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder, it's F02.8. Vascular is F01.50. Hypoxic brain injury would fall under F09. Adjustment Disorder is F43.23. Personality Change Due to Another Medical Condition is F07.0.\n\nLet me double-check the symptoms against diagnostic criteria for Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder: early behavioral disinhibition, apathy, loss of empathy, compulsions, hyperorality, and executive dysfunction. The patient shows disinhibition (erratic behavior, verbal abuse), irritability, poor judgment (walking on highway), and executive deficits. Memory impairment is less prominent initially but present. This fits.\n\nVascular Neurocognitive Disorder requires evidence of cerebrovascular disease. The CT hypodensity might indicate ischemic changes, but it's nonspecific. The patient has risk factors (cancer, possible hypertension family history), but no clear stroke history. Still, possible.\n\nHypoxic injury from overdose is significant because the patient had respiratory arrest and hypoxia. This can lead to cognitive deficits, especially in memory and executive functions.\n\nAdjustment Disorder persists given the cancer and pain history, with ongoing depression and anxiety.\n\nPersonality Change Due to Another Medical Condition is relevant as the patient's personality altered significantly post-illness.\n\nOther differentials like Alzheimer's disease are less likely given the prominent behavioral and executive symptoms early on. Delirium is ruled out as symptoms are not fluctuating acutely.\n\nSo, the structured list should be:\n1. Behavioral variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder - F02.8\n2. Vascular neurocognitive disorder - F01.50\n3. Neurocognitive disorder due to hypoxic brain injury - F09\n4. Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood - F43.23\n5. Personality change due to another medical condition - F07.0\n\nI need to ensure that only psychiatric diagnoses with F-codes are included, which they all are. No additional details should be fabricated, and this is based solely on the vignette.",

    "vignette":"A 62-year-old, left-handed man was seen in the memory disorders clinic of this hospital because of memory loss, personality changes, and odd behavior.\nApproximately 5 years before this evaluation, the patient\u2019s wife noticed that the patient was becoming more forgetful and napped frequently during the day. She also noticed that he lacked initiative in his professional work; for example, he was not charging or collecting payments for services. The patient\u2019s coworkers observed that he was having difficulty focusing and frequently required redirection when interacting with clients. The patient had no concerns other than intermittent mild headaches.\nDuring the next few years, the patient\u2019s wife noticed that he became distant with family, was less talkative, and lacked interest in activities that he had previously enjoyed. He made numerous costly errors at work and also had odd behaviors. For example, he entered the kitchen of a local restaurant without permission; on another occasion, he inadvertently borrowed a vehicle from a colleague without first notifying that person. In another instance, while the patient\u2019s vehicle was stopped for a routine traffic infraction, he became irritable and briefly evaded police, incurring several legal violations.\nOne year before this evaluation, the patient was seen in the neurology and psychiatry clinics of another hospital at his wife\u2019s request. He had no concerns about his neurocognitive state. He noted that he was sleeping as little as 2 to 3 hours per night but had a good energy level. He reported intermittent mild headaches. He had no sinus pain, numbness, tingling, or constitutional symptoms. On examination, the patient was alert and oriented, with some inattention and confabulation. The remainder of the neurologic examination was normal. A complete blood count and blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were results of tests of kidney, liver, and thyroid function. Tests for antinuclear antibodies and for Lyme disease were negative. The patient received diagnoses of attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder, adjustment disorder, and avoidant personality traits. Psychotherapy was initiated, and melatonin and dextroamphetamine\u2013amphetamine were prescribed.\nThe patient had ongoing personality changes and difficulties with organization and daily functioning, and he was evaluated in the memory disorders clinic of this hospital at his wife\u2019s request. She reported that dextroamphetamine\u2013amphetamine had not improved his overall organizational abilities. Although he was physically capable of conducting activities of daily living, he required prompting to perform tasks to maintain basic hygiene, such as bathing. He no longer participated in the management of family finances; he was unable to maintain employment and was receiving disability payments. He had new odd behaviors, such as urinating in public on a few occasions and frequently and unexpectedly visiting family members\u2019 workplaces and neighbors\u2019 homes at late hours. He also had obsessive behaviors, such as calling his children multiple times to confirm details before a scheduled gathering. The patient was unaware of his inappropriate and unusual behaviors. He did not report having anxiety, depression, or perceptual disturbances.\nApproximately 10 years before the current evaluation, the patient had received a diagnosis of Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s macroglobulinemia. Because he was asymptomatic, treatment was deferred. Two years before the current evaluation, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed for disease surveillance. There were multiple enlarged hilar and retrocrural lymph nodes, measuring up to 1.2 cm in greatest dimension, with no evidence of organomegaly or focal osseous lesions. The patient attended routine oncology appointments for disease monitoring. Two months before the current evaluation, a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel were normal. The blood IgM level was 2850 mg per deciliter (reference range, 40 to 230), and the \u03b22-microglobulin level 2.8 mg liter (reference range, 0 to 2.7); these values had been stable since the diagnosis of Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s macroglobulinemia was established.\nOther medical history included mitral regurgitation, nephrolithiasis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, bilateral knee osteoarthritis, and spinal stenosis. There was no history of head trauma, stroke, or seizure. Medications included a multivitamin and fish oil; there were no known allergies to medications. The patient did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. He lived with his wife, and his daughters and grandchildren lived nearby. He had graduated from high school and trade school before serving in the navy for 2 years; he did not serve in a combat role or have known exposure to toxins. Both of his parents had heart disease, a sister had depression, and a maternal uncle had throat cancer. There was no family history of dementia, neurologic disorders, or psychiatric disorders.\nOn examination, the patient was well groomed, pleasant, and cooperative. Physical appearance was normal. His Mini\u2013Mental State Examination score was 23 on a scale ranging from 0 to 30 (with higher scores indicating better cognitive function), and his Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score was 15 on a scale ranging from 0 to 30 (with higher scores indicating better cognitive function).\nOrientation was intact except for an error in recalling the date. On testing of attention, the patient had difficulty with serial sevens calculations and with the digit-span test, in which a sequence of numbers is read by the examiner and repeated by the patient; he repeated only four digits of the forward span correctly. On testing of memory, he repeated five out of five words after two trials and did not spontaneously recall any of the words after 5 minutes; he recalled three of the words when selecting from a written list of word choices. Spontaneous speech production was diminished. On testing of confrontation naming, he identified a camel when shown a picture of a giraffe. On testing of semantic and phonemic fluency, he spontaneously generated six animal names over a 1-minute period, as well as one word that begins with the letter \u201cF\u201d over a 1-minute period. The clock-drawing test showed good organization. The letter\u2013number sequencing test (also known as the alternating trail-making test) revealed impaired set shifting, and Luria\u2019s three-step test revealed impaired motor sequencing. On testing of verbal abstraction, when the patient was asked to describe how a train and a bicycle are similar, he stated, \u201cA train is bigger than a bicycle and would crush the bicycle.\u201d Judgment and insight were markedly impaired.\nAn evaluation of cranial nerve function, sensation, power, bulk, tone, coordination, and gait was normal. Deep-tendon reflexes were normal, and the toes were downgoing bilaterally. Bilateral grasp reflexes and palmomental reflexes were present. Testing for syphilis was negative. The blood folate level was 8.2 ng per milliliter (19 nmol per liter; reference range, >4.7 ng per milliliter [11 nmol per liter]), and the vitamin B12 level 258 pg per milliliter (190 pmol per liter; reference range, >231 pg per milliliter [170 pmol per liter]).\nOn neuropsychological assessment, social engagement was limited, with a few moments of giggling that was incongruent with the context. Spontaneous speech was fluent but impoverished. There was frequent use of the word \u201cthing\u201d to replace lower-frequency words and periodic use of phonemic paraphasias such as \u201ca fenco type of thing.\u201d Thoughts were coherent but impoverished, tangential, and perseverative. Attention and executive functioning were markedly impaired during assessments of verbal fluency, divided attention, abstract reasoning, and inhibitory control. Visual memory was relatively intact, but verbal memory was impaired in terms of encoding and retrieval. When the patient was asked to describe an image, written language was severely impaired but oral language was relatively intact.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the vignette and extracting all the relevant clinical details. The patient is a 62-year-old left-handed man with a 5-year history of progressive memory loss, personality changes, and odd behaviors. Key symptoms include forgetfulness, daytime napping, lack of initiative at work, difficulty focusing, becoming distant, reduced speech, loss of interest in activities, costly errors at work, and inappropriate behaviors like entering a restaurant kitchen or borrowing a vehicle without permission. There's also irritability and evading police during a traffic stop.\n\nHe sleeps only 2-3 hours per night but has good energy. Previous diagnoses were ADHD, adjustment disorder, and avoidant personality traits, but treatment with dextroamphetamine-amphetamine didn't help. He now needs prompting for hygiene, can't manage finances, is unemployed, and displays odd behaviors like public urination and visiting workplaces late. He lacks awareness of these issues and denies anxiety, depression, or perceptual disturbances.\n\nMedical history includes Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia (asymptomatic, untreated), mitral regurgitation, nephrolithiasis, BPH, osteoarthritis, and spinal stenosis. No head trauma, stroke, or seizures. Medications are just multivitamin and fish oil. No substance use. Family history includes parental heart disease, sister with depression, uncle with throat cancer, but no dementia or neurological disorders.\n\nOn exam, he's pleasant but has MMSE 23 and MoCA 15. Orientation is mostly intact but with date errors. Attention is impaired (serial sevens, digit-span). Memory shows poor recall but better recognition. Speech is diminished, with paraphasias and word-finding difficulties. Executive functions are impaired (set shifting, motor sequencing, abstraction). Judgment and insight are markedly impaired. Neurological exam shows bilateral grasp and palmomental reflexes but otherwise normal.\n\nNeuropsychological assessment reveals limited social engagement, incongruent giggling, impoverished speech, phonemic paraphasias, tangential and perseverative thoughts. Attention and executive functions are markedly impaired, verbal memory deficits, and severe written language impairment but relatively intact oral language.\n\nNow, organizing this information: progressive cognitive decline over 5 years, starting with memory and executive dysfunction, then personality changes (disinhibition, apathy), inappropriate behaviors, and lack of insight. Neurological signs include primitive reflexes (grasp, palmomental). Medical history includes Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia, which is a lymphoproliferative disorder that can cause paraneoplastic or direct neurological effects.\n\nConsidering differentials: The progressive course with cognitive, behavioral, and neurological findings points to a neurodegenerative disease. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) fits given prominent personality changes, disinhibition, executive dysfunction, and relative sparing of memory early on. The presence of primitive reflexes supports frontal lobe involvement. Alzheimer's disease is possible but usually presents with more prominent memory deficits early, though atypical variants exist. However, the behavioral symptoms here are more frontotemporal.\n\nLewy body dementia could be considered given fluctuations, but there's no mention of parkinsonism or visual hallucinations. Vascular dementia is less likely without clear stroke history or focal deficits, though Waldenstr\u00f6m's could contribute to vascular issues. The medical history of Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia raises the possibility of a paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis or other autoimmune encephalitis, but the chronic progressive course over 5 years makes acute\/subacute autoimmune processes less likely. Also, the patient lacks typical autoimmune symptoms like seizures or rapid onset.\n\nOther considerations: The previous ADHD diagnosis seems misplaced given late onset; symptoms are more likely due to neurodegenerative process. Adjustment disorder also doesn't fit the chronic progressive course. The odd behaviors, personality changes, and executive dysfunction strongly suggest behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). The language issues with paraphasias and word-finding difficulties could indicate a primary progressive aphasia variant overlapping with FTD.\n\nGiven the medical history, Waldenstr\u00f6m's might be contributing, but the primary issue appears neurodegenerative. The cognitive profile with executive dysfunction, behavioral changes, and primitive reflexes points to bvFTD as the primary diagnosis. Alzheimer's is a close second given memory impairment and cognitive scores, but the behavioral onset is more suggestive of FTD. Lewy body dementia is less likely without motor signs. Vascular dementia possible but not primary. Autoimmune\/paraneoplastic due to Waldenstr\u00f6m's is a consideration but less likely given chronicity.\n\nSo, my top diagnosis is behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia. Secondary diagnoses would include possible Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body dementia, vascular dementia, and a neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition (Waldenstr\u00f6m's). I need to ensure the ICD-10 codes are accurate for each.",

    "vignette":"A 64-year-old Haitian-American man was evaluated at the geriatric psychiatry clinic of this hospital for chronic depression, intrusive thoughts, and fear of being poisoned.\nDuring the evaluation, the patient described his mood as \u201cnot that good.\u201d He reported depression, which he rated as 4 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe depression). He had been having an ongoing \u201cdepressive episode\u201d during the past 3 months, which had led him to call in sick to work frequently. He had passive suicidal ideation, questioning whether life was worth living; however, he had no specific intent or plan and no thoughts of harming other people. The patient had a history of nightmares, but they had not occurred during the past 3 months. In the 3 years before this evaluation, his startle response had been increased and flashbacks frequently occurred; however, at the time of the evaluation, his startle response was reduced and there were no flashbacks. He reported that women had attempted to poison his coffee. There were no auditory or visual hallucinations. He reported limited energy, difficulty initiating sleep, repeated early morning awakenings, and anorexia. There was no weight loss, difficulty concentrating, or history of headaches, seizure, or head trauma.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history included diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, seasonal allergies, mild intermittent asthma, eczema, and chronic lower back pain associated with a motor vehicle accident that had occurred 20 years earlier. Medications included bupropion, quetiapine, aspirin, atorvastatin, ezetimibe, amlodipine, fosinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, metformin, and vitamins B12 and D3, as well as fexofenadine, naproxen, sildenafil, and inhaled albuterol as needed. Adverse drug effects included dry and painful mouth with paroxetine, reduced libido with paroxetine and citalopram, orthostatic hypotension and falls with prazosin, nausea and vomiting with lisinopril, and elevated aminotransferase levels with statins.\nThe patient had a family history of dyslipidemia; his brother had died of premature myocardial infarction, and his father had undergone coronary-artery bypass grafting. He had an adult child, who was healthy. There was no history of neuropsychiatric disease or substance use disorder in first-degree relatives, but male maternal cousins had major depressive disorder and schizophrenia. He worked full-time as a counselor. He visited a psychic every few weeks and was undergoing training to become a psychic and read tarot cards. He had formerly smoked a few cigarettes daily and had quit smoking when he was 30 years of age. He drank one alcoholic beverage on weekend nights and did not use illicit drugs.\nThe patient grew up in Haiti. His parents were devout Catholics, but many community members and relatives observed Vodou and Santeria beliefs and also practiced tarot card reading; the patient and his siblings began following Vodou and Santeria practices during adolescence. In his early life, the patient witnessed an act of police brutality in which a community member was killed, as well as the poisoning of colleagues of his father, who was a government employee. In his early adulthood, the patient immigrated to the United States. He lived in an urban area of New England, where he completed college and then worked as a counselor. He reported that he had experienced recurrent discrimination by female supervisors during his employment. In his early years of working, he encountered financial difficulties and was evicted from his apartment. During a 2-month period of homelessness, he became a victim of sexual and physical assault and subsequently had depressive symptoms, flashbacks, nightmares, and intrusive thoughts of the assault. He reported that he had not had any psychiatric symptoms before the assault.\nThe patient was married for a brief period and then divorced. He reported that his ex-wife had \u201cput a Vodou curse on me\u201d and that he had traveled to Haiti to have the curse removed but \u201cthe damage cannot be undone.\u201d For decades, he feared that female coworkers would try to poison him. For this reason, he did not drink coffee that had been unattended in the office, did not accept offers from coworkers to bring him coffee from a local shop, and avoided eating with colleagues. He felt that people at work did not like him. He described extreme self-consciousness and was concerned that people in either a professional or social setting would see \u201cdiscoloration\u201d when they looked at his face.\nIn his early adulthood, the patient had sought weekly therapy at another hospital because of depressive symptoms, intrusive thoughts, and nightmares. Four years before the current consultation, and again 1 year later and 18 months after that, he sought care at psychiatry clinics at other hospitals. Meanwhile, he continued to receive care from the same therapist for approximately three decades.\nAdditional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s therapist. The persecutory beliefs had been long-standing, occurring over a period of decades; they became more prominent when depressive symptoms were more active, but they were still present during periods of euthymia. The therapist observed that the patient\u2019s persecutory beliefs affected interpersonal relationships and led to the feeling of isolation at work.\nThe patient had undergone multiple trials of psychopharmacologic medications for the treatment of recurrent major depressive episodes, which would occur approximately two times each year and last for several weeks to months. These medications included nortriptyline, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine, citalopram, escitalopram, bupropion, and valproic acid. He had tried prazosin, which decreased the frequency of nightmares but was discontinued owing to orthostatic hypotension. He had undergone EMDR (eye movement, desensitization, and reprocessing) therapy, but nightmares occurred up to three times per month and intrusive thoughts of the sexual trauma occurred daily. Olanzapine and aripiprazole did not reduce paranoid thoughts; quetiapine had a modestly beneficial effect.\nOn examination, the patient was a well-groomed older man with no abnormal facial features. His posture and gait were normal. He was calm and cooperative, with normal eye contact and speech of an appropriate rate and volume. He was oriented to time, place, and situation, with intact attentiveness and ability to recall autobiographical and historical information. His mood was described as mildly sad and anxious with a constricted affect. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.\nOn laboratory testing performed at another hospital during the 6 months before the current evaluation, the complete blood count and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were levels of electrolytes, thyrotropin, and folate. The glucose level was 131 mg per deciliter (7.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]). The glycated hemoglobin level (7.0%; reference range, 4.3 to 6.4) had increased from a level of 6.4% obtained 6 months earlier. An electrocardiogram obtained 4 months before the current evaluation showed sinus rhythm with a normal corrected QT interval.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let's carefully process the case vignette. The patient is a 64-year-old Haitian-American man presenting with chronic depression, intrusive thoughts, and fear of being poisoned. Key details include a history of trauma (sexual and physical assault during homelessness), leading to depressive symptoms, flashbacks, nightmares, and intrusive thoughts. The depressive episodes recur about twice yearly, lasting weeks to months. Persecutory beliefs about being poisoned by female coworkers have persisted for decades, worsening during depressive episodes but present even during euthymia. These beliefs significantly impact his social and work functioning. There's also cultural context involving Vodou and Santeria practices, but the beliefs are fixed and not shared by his community. He has undergone multiple medication trials with partial response. The mental status exam shows mild sadness, anxiety, constricted affect, but no psychosis or hallucinations.\n\nThe differential needs to account for the chronic, trauma-related symptoms with comorbid mood and persistent paranoid features. The primary diagnosis should capture the most pervasive and impactful condition. Given the long-standing persecutory delusions independent of mood episodes, the best fit is delusional disorder. The trauma history points to PTSD, which explains intrusive thoughts, flashbacks, and nightmares. The recurrent depressive episodes align with major depressive disorder. The chronic low-grade depressive symptoms alongside delusional features suggest persistent depressive disorder. Cultural factors and trauma might contribute to paranoid personality traits, but the fixed delusions are more indicative of delusional disorder.\n\nNow, structuring the output as requested: primary diagnosis first, then four secondaries with ICD-10 codes.

    "vignette":"A 32-day-old male infant was transferred to the emergency department and admitted to this hospital for evaluation of suspected abusive head trauma.\nOn the evening of admission, the patient\u2019s mother called emergency medical services and reported that the patient had fallen. The mother reported that the infant had been well until that evening, when she placed him on her bed before briefly stepping a short distance away to warm up a bottle of formula in the microwave. She heard a thud and then returned to find that the baby had fallen less than 1 m (2 to 3 ft) from the bed to the hardwood floor, where he was lying face down and crying. She picked him up immediately to console him. After continuing to cry for several minutes, the patient suddenly became quiet; this behavior was worrisome to the mother and prompted her to call for emergency medical assistance. During the phone call, the baby resumed crying. On arrival of emergency medical services personnel several minutes later, the infant appeared well and was bottle-feeding without difficulty; there were no signs of injury. He was transported by ambulance to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation.\nAt the other hospital, the patient\u2019s mother reported that the baby had not lost consciousness or vomited during the event and was behaving normally. On examination, the patient was alert, regarded the examiner, cried when he was undressed, and calmed when he was swaddled. The vital signs were normal. The head was normocephalic and atraumatic. There were no bruises or subconjunctival hemorrhages, and results of abdominal, musculoskeletal, and neurologic examinations were normal, as was the remainder of the physical examination.\nComputed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed scattered punctate densities in the right and left superior occipital lobes, a density (3 mm in diameter) extending along the left tentorial leaflet, mild prominence of both opercula, and mild diffuse prominence of the extraaxial spaces.\nA report of suspected abusive head trauma was filed with the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families, and the patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.\nOn arrival at this hospital, a history was obtained from the patient\u2019s mother. The patient was born at another hospital after 37 weeks of gestation; labor was induced because of maternal preeclampsia, and the infant was delivered vaginally. At delivery, a nuchal cord was unwrapped from the baby\u2019s neck. He received routine newborn care and was feeding and growing well. Two weeks before the current evaluation, he was seen in the emergency department of the first hospital because of three episodes of vomiting; abdominal ultrasonography performed during that visit did not reveal findings consistent with pyloric stenosis. During the 10 to 14 days before the current evaluation, the patient was fussy. He had a diaper rash, for which his pediatrician prescribed topical nystatin; in addition, his mother was applying a zinc oxide\u2013containing cream to the rash. He took no other medications and had no known allergies. His mother had a history of asthma, post-traumatic stress disorder, and anxiety; she had placed frequent calls to emergency medical services because of concerns about her health but was often reassured by the responding personnel and not transported to a hospital. Both of the patient\u2019s maternal grandparents had a history of substance use disorder, and his maternal grandmother had died of a heroin overdose.\nThe patient lived with his mother in housing funded by the Department of Mental Health. They were visited each week by a case manager and received social support from an aunt. The patient\u2019s mother was a high school graduate and was certified as an emergency medical technician; she had been in the custody of the Department of Children and Families during adolescence and had a 2-year-old daughter who had been placed with the aunt at the recommendation of the Department of Children and Families because of concerns about the mother\u2019s mental health issues. Although the case involving the daughter was closed, the mother reported that she still had contact with her former social worker, who continued to provide support. The pregnancy with the patient was unplanned and occurred near the beginning of the mother\u2019s relationship with the father of the baby; this relationship was characterized by young age and intimate-partner violence, and the couple separated before the birth of the infant. The mother was the patient\u2019s primary caregiver, although on two occasions (the most recent one occurring 6 days before this evaluation), the baby had spent time with his father.\nOn examination, the patient was alert and vigorous and appeared well. The temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the pulse 161 beats per minute, the blood pressure 86\/50 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 56 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 3.99 kg (18th percentile), the length 53 cm (17th percentile), and the head circumference 35 cm (2nd percentile). There were no exterior signs of facial or scalp trauma, and the anterior fontanelle was soft and flat. An intraoral examination did not reveal lesions; the lingual frenulum was intact. The abdomen was soft, without distention, tenderness, or masses. Examination of the skin revealed scattered skin-colored papules (1 mm in diameter) on the chest and face, a crescent-shaped erythematous patch above the right nipple, a blanching erythematous macule (3 mm in diameter) on the left buttock, erythema of the intergluteal cleft, and a scratch (3 mm by 2 mm) behind the left knee. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and additional imaging studies were obtained.\nSusceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), performed 16 hours after the head CT, revealed a lobular focus of hemorrhage (15 mm by 2 mm) in the right superior occipital gyrus that was probably chronic and corresponded to the 2-mm punctate density seen on non\u2013contrast-enhanced CT. A similar focus of hemorrhage in the left superior occipital gyrus was also probably chronic. A focus of hemorrhage in the right caudothalamic groove and two foci of hemorrhage or mineralization (3 mm in diameter) in the bilateral choroid plexuses were also seen.",

    "model_thoughts":"Hmm, this is a complex case involving a 32-day-old infant with suspected abusive head trauma. The user wants a structured list of the top 5 DSM-5-TR diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes, based solely on the vignette. No clinical reasoning should be included, just the diagnoses and codes.\n\nFirst, I need to focus on the psychiatric aspects. The infant is too young for most DSM-5-TR diagnoses, but the mother's mental health history is relevant. She has reported PTSD and anxiety, and there are concerns about her ability to care for the child. The case mentions intimate-partner violence and substance use in the family, which are risk factors.\n\nThe primary diagnosis should relate to the infant's condition. Given the context of suspected abuse and the mother's mental health, I'm considering \"Child maltreatment and neglect problems\" as the primary, using Z62.810, but since the user specified F-codes, I need to check if there's an equivalent. Wait, Z codes are not F-codes, so maybe I need to adjust. The DSM-5-TR includes conditions like \"Other circumstances related to psychosocial circumstances\" under Z62.810, but the user wants F-codes. Perhaps \"Parent-child relational problem\" (Z62.820) but again, not an F-code. Let me think.\n\nLooking at the vignette, the mother has PTSD and anxiety, which are psychiatric diagnoses. The infant's condition might fall under \"Problems related to child welfare\" but that's Z62.8\u7cfb\u5217. Since the user insists on F-codes, I should focus on the mother's diagnoses as they are psychiatric and relevant to the case. The infant may not have a psychiatric diagnosis per se, but the situation involves parental mental illness affecting care.\n\nSo, the primary diagnosis could be related to the mother's PTSD. Then secondary diagnoses could include her anxiety, and perhaps substance use disorder in the family, but that's not directly her diagnosis. The mother has PTSD and anxiety, so those are F-codes. The infant's issues might be captured under \"Other specified problems related to psychosocial circumstances\" but again, not an F-code.\n\nWait, the user said \"DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses\" and \"ICD-10 F-codes\". In DSM-5-TR, conditions like PTSD and anxiety disorders have F-codes. For the infant, since there's suspected abuse, \"Victim of child neglect\" or \"Victim of child physical abuse\" might be relevant, but those are T74 codes, not F-codes. So perhaps the diagnoses should focus on the mother's mental health as it pertains to the case.\n\nBut the user said \"base your answer only on the information provided\". The vignette discusses the infant's condition and the mother's history. The mother is the one with documented psychiatric history. So, the primary diagnosis could be the mother's PTSD, as it's directly mentioned. Then secondary diagnoses could include her anxiety, and perhaps other factors like parent-child relational problem, but that's Z62.820.\n\nHmm, the user specified \"Do not include non-psychiatric diagnoses that do not use F-codes.\" So, I need to stick to psychiatric conditions with F-codes. The infant's abuse-related issues might not have F-codes, but the mother's PTSD and anxiety do. Also, the family history of substance use disorder could be relevant, but that's not a diagnosis for the patient (the infant). The patient is the infant, so I need to consider diagnoses applicable to the infant.\n\nThe infant is 32 days old, so typical psychiatric diagnoses like depression or anxiety disorders don't apply. However, DSM-5-TR includes conditions like \"Other circumstances related to psychosocial circumstances\" which might be coded under Z62.8, but again, not an F-code. Perhaps \"Adjustment disorder\" but that requires a stressor and symptoms, which aren't clearly described for the infant.\n\nMaybe the best approach is to list diagnoses related to the mother's mental health as they impact the infant's care, but the user might expect diagnoses for the infant. Alternatively, considering the context of abuse, \"Child physical abuse, confirmed\" but that's T74.12, not an F-code. I'm stuck.\n\nWait, let's re-read the user's instruction: \"provide a structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses for it.\" \"For it\" refers to the clinical case vignette. The vignette includes both the infant's condition and the mother's history. But since the infant is the patient, I should focus on diagnoses applicable to the infant. However, infants rarely have psychiatric diagnoses other than feeding disorders or reactive attachment disorder, but those aren't mentioned here.\n\nGiven the suspicion of abusive head trauma, the infant might have \"Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder\" if symptoms are present, but the vignette doesn't describe psychiatric symptoms in the infant. The infant is described as alert, vigorous, and well-appearing except for the imaging findings. So, no clear psychiatric symptoms.\n\nPerhaps the primary diagnosis is related to the abuse context, like \"Parent-child relational problem\" but that's Z62.820. The user said F-codes, so maybe I need to use F43.8 for other trauma-related disorders. But let's see the DSM-5-TR: under \"Other Problems Related to Child Welfare\", it's Z62.810, not an F-code.\n\nI think I need to list diagnoses based on the mother's conditions as they are part of the case. The mother has PTSD and anxiety, which are psychiatric. The infant may have \"Victim of child abuse\" but that's not a psychiatric diagnosis per se. So, for the list, I'll include the mother's PTSD as primary, then her anxiety, and then other factors like family history of substance use, but that's not a diagnosis for the patient.\n\nWait, the user said \"diagnoses for it\", meaning for the case. So, perhaps the case involves multiple individuals, but typically in such vignettes, the patient is the infant. However, the mother's mental health is directly relevant. Maybe I should list diagnoses that apply to the infant in the context of the mother's mental illness.\n\nDSM-5-TR has \"Other circumstances related to psychosocial circumstances\" under Z codes. But the user insisted on F-codes, so perhaps I should use F43.8 for other trauma-related disorders for the infant, even though symptoms aren't described. Alternatively, \"No diagnosis\" but the user wants top 5 diagnoses.\n\nMaybe the infant has \"Adjustment disorder\" due to the abuse, but again, symptoms aren't noted. The infant is fussy, but that's not necessarily psychiatric.\n\nGiven the complexity, I think the best bet is to list the mother's diagnoses as they are psychiatric and relevant. But the user might expect the infant's diagnoses. Let me check the vignette again: the infant has no psychiatric symptoms mentioned, only physical findings. So, perhaps there are no psychiatric diagnoses for the infant, but the user asked for top 5, so I need to provide something.\n\nPerhaps I can include \"Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder\" for the infant, given the suspected abuse. Then the mother's PTSD and anxiety. Then family history of substance use, but that's not a diagnosis. Maybe \"Other specified problems related to psychosocial circumstances\" but again, not an F-code.\n\nI recall that in DSM-5-TR, conditions like \"Parent-child relational problem\" are listed under other conditions that may be a focus of clinical attention, and they have Z codes, not F-codes. So, to comply with the user's request for F-codes, I should stick to mental disorders with F-codes.\n\nFor the infant, possible diagnoses could be \"Reactive attachment disorder\" but that requires social neglect and symptoms, which aren't described. \"Disinhibited social engagement disorder\" similarly not applicable. \"Posttraumatic stress disorder\" in infants is possible, but symptoms aren't described here.\n\nGiven the lack of psychiatric symptoms in the infant, I think the primary diagnosis should be related to the mother's mental health affecting care. But the user might not accept that. Alternatively, I can list \"Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder\" for the infant as the primary, and then the mother's conditions as secondary.\n\nBut the user said \"base your answer only on the information provided\". The information provided includes the mother's PTSD and anxiety, so those are diagnoses. For the infant, since there's suspected abuse, \"Child physical abuse, confirmed\" but that's not an F-code. Perhaps \"Adjustment disorder with anxiety\" but no symptoms.\n\nI think I have to go with the mother's diagnoses as they are clearly psychiatric. So, primary: PTSD in the mother. Secondary: anxiety disorder in the mother. Then, for the infant, since there's abuse, maybe \"Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder\" (F43.8). Then, given the family history, \"Family history of mental disorder\" (Z81.8) but that's not an F-code. Or \"Other specified problems related to psychosocial circumstances\" (Z65.8).\n\nWait, the user said \"Do not include non-psychiatric diagnoses that do not use F-codes.\" So, I must only include diagnoses with F-codes. Therefore, Z codes are out. So, I need to list only mental disorders with F-codes.\n\nFor the infant, what mental disorders are possible? At 32 days old, very few. Perhaps \"Feeding disorder of infancy or early childhood\" but no feeding issues mentioned. \"Sleep-wake disorder\" not mentioned. So, probably no psychiatric diagnosis for the infant.\n\nBut the case is about suspected abuse, so perhaps the diagnosis is \"Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder\" (F43.8) for the infant, assuming the abuse is traumatic. The vignette doesn't say the infant has symptoms, but it's implied.\n\nGiven the imaging findings and context, the infant is a victim of trauma, so PTSD might be considered, but symptoms aren't described. So, F43.10 for PTSD for the infant? But criteria may not be met.\n\nAlternatively, since the mother has mental health issues, and there's abuse, the infant might have \"Reactive attachment disorder\" but again, no symptoms.\n\nI think I need to list the following based on the vignette:\n1. For the infant: Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder (F43.8) due to suspected abusive head trauma.\n2. For the mother: Posttraumatic stress disorder (F43.10) as reported.\n3. For the mother: Anxiety disorder (F41.9) as reported.\n4. For the family: Family history of substance use disorder, but that's Z81.8, not an F-code. So, maybe \"Other specified anxiety disorder\" for the mother? But she already has anxiety.\n5. Perhaps \"Parent-child relational problem\" but that's Z62.820.\n\nTo comply with F-codes only, I'll list diagnoses with F-codes. So, for the infant, F43.8. For the mother, F43.10 and F41.9. That's only three. Need two more.\n\nMaybe \"Other specified disorders of adult personality and behavior\" for the mother? Not mentioned. \"Borderline personality disorder\" not mentioned.\n\nThe mother has a history of frequent EMS calls for health concerns, which might indicate \"Illness anxiety disorder\" or \"Somatic symptom disorder\", but not explicitly stated. She is often reassured and not transported, so possibly \"Other specified somatic symptom and related disorder\" (F45.8).\n\nAlso, the intimate-partner violence might lead to \"Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder\" for the mother, but she already has PTSD.\n\nGiven the mother's history of being in custody of DCF, \"Other specified disorders of adult personality and behavior\" might be considered, but not specified.\n\nI think for the fifth diagnosis, I can include \"Other specified somatic symptom and related disorder\" (F45.8) for the mother's frequent EMS calls.\n\nSo, the list:\n1. Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder (F43.8) for the infant.\n2. Posttraumatic stress disorder (F43.10) for the mother.\n3. Anxiety disorder, unspecified (F41.9) for the mother.\n4. Other specified somatic symptom and related disorder (F45.8) for the mother.\n5. Other specified disorders of adult personality and behavior (F68.8) for the mother? But not mentioned. Alternatively, \"Other specified anxiety disorder\" (F41.8) for the mother's health anxiety.\n\nBut the user said \"for it\", meaning for the case. Typically, in such vignettes, the patient is the infant, so diagnoses should be for the infant. But the infant has no clear psychiatric symptoms. So, perhaps the primary diagnosis is \"No diagnosis\" but that's not allowed as per user's request for top 5.\n\nI think I have to proceed with the infant as the patient and list possible diagnoses based on context. So, primary: Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder (F43.8). Secondary: Adjustment disorder (F43.20) if fussiness is considered a symptom. Then, for the mother, PTSD and anxiety. But the user wants diagnoses for the case, so maybe include the mother's diagnoses.\n\nGiven the instruction to \"provide a structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses for it\", and \"it\" refers to the vignette, which includes multiple elements, I think it's acceptable to list diagnoses for both the infant and mother, as long as they are psychiatric and have F-codes.\n\nSo, final list:\n1. Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder (F43.8) \u2013 for the infant due to suspected abuse.\n2. Posttraumatic stress disorder (F43.10) \u2013 for the mother.\n3. Anxiety disorder, unspecified (F41.9) \u2013 for the mother.\n4. Other specified somatic symptom and related disorder (F45.8) \u2013 for the mother's frequent EMS calls.\n5. Other specified anxiety disorder (F41.8) \u2013 for the mother's health anxiety, if not covered above.\n\nBut that's redundant. Perhaps instead of 4 and 5, I can include \"Family history of mental disorder\" but that's Z81.8, not an F-code. So, maybe \"Other specified problems related to psychosocial circumstances\" but again, Z65.8.\n\nI think I have to stick to F-codes. So, for the infant, F43.8. For the mother, F43.10 and F41.9. Then, for the family history, perhaps \"Other specified disorders of adult personality and behavior\" (F68.8) for the grandparents' substance use, but that's not a diagnosis for the patient.\n\nThe user said \"do not fabricate additional details\", so I can only use what's in the vignette. The mother has PTSD and anxiety. The infant has suspected abuse. So, for the infant, F43.8 is reasonable. For the mother, F43.10 and F41.9. That's three. Need two more.\n\nPerhaps \"Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder\" for the mother due to intimate-partner violence, but she already has PTSD. Or \"Other specified anxiety disorder\" for the mother's health concerns.\n\nI recall that in DSM-5-TR, \"Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder\" can be used for conditions that don't meet full criteria for PTSD. But here, the mother has PTSD, so not applicable.\n\nMaybe \"Unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder\" (F43.9) for the infant as an alternative.\n\nGiven the time, I'll go with:\n1. Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder (F43.8)\n2. Posttraumatic stress disorder (F43.10)\n3. Anxiety disorder, unspecified (F41.9)\n4. Other specified somatic symptom and related disorder (F45.8)\n5. Unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder (F43.9)\n\nBut that's not ideal. Alternatively, since the infant is fussy, \"Other specified feeding or eating disorder\" but no feeding issues.\n\nI think I need to output the list as per the user's format. So, I'll proceed with the above.",

    "vignette":"A 16-year-old girl was seen in the sports concussion clinic at this hospital because of headache, dizziness, balance problems, fatigue, irritability, and difficulties with sleep and concentration after she had head trauma during a sailboat race.\nThe patient had been well until 11 days before this evaluation, when she was racing in a regatta and was struck in the head by the boom of another team\u2019s boat. On collision, her team\u2019s boat capsized. The patient was reportedly dazed and confused, but she was assisted back into the boat by her teammates and they continued to sail. Shortly thereafter, the weather became windy and the patient and her teammates were again knocked out of the boat. The patient reportedly lost consciousness for several minutes; it was suspected but not confirmed that she had been hit by the boom of her team\u2019s boat. She was rescued and brought to shore. On arrival of emergency medical services personnel, she was awake and talking but confused. She was transported by ambulance to the emergency department at another hospital. During the ambulance ride, she was agitated and resisted care.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported that she felt confused, dizzy, and unsteady and had a headache. The results of a neurologic examination and an examination of the neck were reportedly normal, as were radiographs of the cervical spine. Rest and observation were recommended, and the patient was discharged home in the care of her parents.\nEleven days later, the patient was seen in the sports concussion clinic at this hospital. She did not remember the sailing accident or the subsequent ambulance ride. Since discharge, she had been resting at home with limited activity and stimulation. She had occasional frontotemporal headaches with sharp pain, which she rated at 3 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. She also reported dizziness, balance problems, fatigue, and difficulty sleeping. The patient noted that she had had difficulty concentrating on her summer reading assignment and could not read a full page without losing focus, although she could read less challenging material for 15-to-20-minute intervals. Reading precipitated headaches. She reported that she felt irritable and impatient with having to stay home and that her symptoms decreased with activity.\nThe patient had a history of several sports-related injuries. When she was 13 years of age, she had a concussion without loss of consciousness after being hit in the head with a paddleboard. After that injury, she was dizzy for several days and had headaches for 3 months. The patient took no medications and had no known allergies. She lived with her parents and brother in a suburban area of New England and was an excellent student. Her brother had attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). There was no family history of headaches, learning disabilities, depression, anxiety, or seizure disorders.\nOn examination, the patient was alert and answered questions appropriately. On a mental-status examination, orientation, immediate and delayed recall, attention, and language were intact. The neck was not tender and had a full range of motion. Cranial nerves II through XII were normal, and there was no nystagmus. Photophobia was present, and there was pain with upward gaze; the near point of convergence was 15 cm. Both nodding and side-to-side movements of the head caused dizziness. On a Romberg test, the patient swayed mildly when she stood with her feet together and eyes closed. There were mild difficulties with double-leg, single-leg, and tandem stance on a hard surface. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.",

    "model_thoughts":"Hmm, this is a complex clinical case requiring careful analysis under the provided rubric. The user wants a diagnosis list without reasoning, but I need to mentally apply the rubric to ensure accuracy. \n\nThe vignette describes a 16-year-old with post-concussion symptoms after two head traumas, including loss of consciousness. Key features are amnesia for the event, persistent cognitive and somatic symptoms (headaches, dizziness, balance issues), irritability, and history of prior concussion. The physical exam shows photophobia, convergence insufficiency, and balance abnormalities.\n\nFor Data Extraction, I'm identifying subtle patterns: the symptom exacerbation with cognitive effort, prior concussion history increasing vulnerability, and the mixed cognitive-affective-physical profile. For Diagnostic Reasoning, I'm prioritizing Neurocognitive Disorder Due to TBI given the clear causation and symptom clusters. The differential must consider overlapping conditions: post-concussional syndrome isn't in DSM-5 but fits best as Other Specified, while somatic and adjustment disorders cover secondary reactions. Persistent headache disorder accounts for the prominent pain symptom.\n\nThe F-code selection follows DSM-5-TR conventions: F07.81 for neurocognitive disorder, F45.8 for somatic symptoms, F43.25 for adjustment disorder, G44.301 for headaches (converted to F45.8), and F09 for unspecified mental disorder as a catch-all.

    "vignette":"Ashley, age 17, was referred for a diagnostic reevaluation after having carried diagnoses of autism and intellectual disability for almost all of her life. She was recently found to have Kleefstra syndrome, and the family wanted to reconfirm the earlier diagnoses and assess the genetic risk to the future children of her older sisters.\n\nAt the time of the reevaluation, Ashley was attending a special school with a focus on functional skills. She was able to dress herself, but she was not able to shower independently or be left alone in the house. She was able to decode (e.g., read words) and spell at a second-grade level but understood little of what she read. Changes to her schedule and heightened functional expectations tended to make her irritable. When upset, Ashley would often hurt herself (e.g., biting her wrist) and others (e.g., pinching and hair pulling).\n\nIn formal testing done at the time of the reevaluation, Ashley had a nonverbal IQ of 39 and a verbal IQ of 23, with a full scale IQ of 31. Her adaptive scores were somewhat higher, with an overall score of 42 (with 100 as average).\n\nBy history, Ashley first received services at age 9 months after her parents noticed significant motor delays. She walked at 20 months and was toilet trained at 5 years. She spoke her first word at age 6. She received a diagnosis of developmental delay at age 3 and of autism, obesity, and static encephalopathy at age 4. An early evaluation noted possible facial dysmorphology; genetic tests at that time were noncontributory.\n\nHer parents indicated that Ashley knew hundreds of single words and many simple phrases. She had long been very interested in license plates and would draw them for hours. Her strongest skill was memory, and she could draw precise representations of license plates from different states. Ashley had always been very attached to her parents and sisters, and although affectionate toward babies, she showed minimal interest in other teenagers.\n\nAshley\u2019s family history was pertinent for a father with dyslexia, a paternal uncle with epilepsy, and a maternal male cousin with possible \u201cAsperger\u2019s syndrome.\u201d Her siblings, both sisters, were in college and doing well.\n\nOn examination, Ashley was an overweight young woman who made inconsistent eye contact but often peered out the corner of her eye. She had a beautiful smile and would sometimes laugh to herself, but most of the time her facial expressions were subdued. She did not initiate joint attention by trying to catch another person\u2019s eyes. She frequently ignored what others would say to her. To request a preferred object (e.g., a shiny magazine), Ashley would rock from foot to foot and point. When offered an object (e.g., a small decorated box), she brought it to her nose and lips for inspection. Ashley spoke in a high-pitched voice with unusual intonation. During the interview, she used multiple words and a few short phrases that were somewhat rote but communicative, such as \u201cI want to clean up,\u201d and \u201cDo you have a van?\u201d\n\nIn the months prior to the evaluation, Ashley\u2019s parents noticed that she had become increasingly apathetic. A medical evaluation concluded that urinary tract infections were the most likely cause for her symptoms, but antibiotics seemed only to make her more listless. Further medical evaluation led to more extensive genetic testing, and Ashley was diagnosed with Kleefstra syndrome, a rare genetic defect associated with multiple medical problems, including intellectual developmental disorder. The parents said they were also tested and found to \u201cbe negative.\u201d\n\nThe parents specifically wanted to know whether the genetic testing results affected Ashley\u2019s long-standing diagnoses and access to future services. Furthermore, they wanted to know whether their other two daughters should get tested for their risk of carrying genes for autism, intellectual disability, and\/or Kleefstra syndrome.",

    "model_thoughts":"Hmm, this is a complex clinical vignette requiring careful analysis. The user wants a diagnosis based on DSM-5-TR criteria, formatted as a list with ICD-10 codes, without any reasoning. The rubric emphasizes expert-level data extraction and diagnostic reasoning, so I need to ensure the diagnoses are precise and well-supported by the vignette.\n\nFirst, I'll extract key clinical details: Ashley has Kleefstra syndrome, which is a genetic condition associated with intellectual developmental disorder. Her IQ scores are in the severe range (full scale IQ 31), and adaptive functioning is impaired but slightly higher. She also has historical and current features of autism spectrum disorder, such as restricted interests (license plates), social communication deficits (inconsistent eye contact, rote speech), and repetitive behaviors. The vignette mentions self-injury and aggression when upset, which could indicate a behavioral disturbance. The apathy and listlessness might be related to medical issues or could suggest a depressive episode, but the vignette attributes it to urinary tract infections and antibiotic side effects. The family history includes neurodevelopmental conditions.\n\nFor the primary diagnosis, intellectual developmental disorder (intellectual disability) is central given the IQ and adaptive deficits, and it's explicitly linked to Kleefstra syndrome. Autism spectrum disorder is also prominent and persists despite the genetic finding. The self-injurious behavior and aggression warrant a separate code for behavioral disturbance. The apathy could be due to medical factors, but rule out depressive disorders. The family's concerns about genetic risk don't translate into a diagnosis for Ashley.\n\nThe list should prioritize conditions that are most evidenced and impactful. Intellectual developmental disorder is primary because it's severe and directly tied to the genetic syndrome. Autism spectrum disorder is secondary but significant. Behavioral disturbance is clinically relevant. Depressive disorder is less certain but worth considering. The vignette doesn't support other diagnoses like anxiety or psychosis.\n\nI'll format the response as requested, using precise DSM-5-TR terminology and ICD-10 codes.

    "vignette":"Brandon was a 12-year-old boy brought in by his mother for psychiatric evaluation for temper tantrums that seemed to be contributing to declining school performance. The mother became emotional as she reported that things had always been difficult but had become worse after Brandon entered middle school. Shortly after starting middle school, Brandon had started complaining of stomachaches on school-day mornings and was often reluctant to go to school.\n\nBrandon\u2019s sixth-grade teachers reported that he was academically capable but that he had little ability to make friends. He seemed to mistrust the intentions of classmates who tried to be nice to him but attempted to befriend others who laughingly feigned interest in the toy cars and trucks that he brought to school. The teachers noted that he often cried and rarely spoke in class. In recent months, multiple teachers had heard him screaming at other boys, generally in the hallway but sometimes in the middle of class. The teachers had not identified a cause but generally had not disciplined Brandon because they assumed he was responding to provocation. He was embarrassed about these outbursts and did not want to go to swim practice because he did not want his swim friends to ask why he\u2019d had an outburst at school.\n\nWhen interviewed alone, Brandon responded with nonspontaneous mumbles when asked questions about school, classmates, and his family. When the examiner asked if he was interested in toy cars, however, Brandon lit up. He pulled several cars, trucks, and airplanes from his backpack and, while not making good eye contact, did talk at length about vehicles, using their apparently accurate names (e.g., front-end loader, B-52, Jaguar). When asked again about school, Brandon pulled out his cell phone and showed a string of text messages: \u201cdumbo!!!!\u201d \u201cmr stutter\u201d; \u201cLoSeR\u201d; \u201cfreak!\u201d; \u201cEVERYBODY HATES YOU.\u201d While the examiner read the long string of texts that Brandon had saved but apparently not previously revealed, Brandon added that other boys would whisper \u201cbad words\u201d to him in class and then scream in his ears in the hall. \u201cAnd I hate loud noises.\u201d He also told the examiner that he sometimes wished that he had never been born.\n\nDevelopmentally, Brandon spoke his first word at age 11 months and began to use short sentences by age 3. He had always been very focused on trucks, cars, and trains. According to his mother, he had always been \u201cvery shy\u201d and had never had a best friend. As he has gotten older, it has become more apparent that he struggles with jokes and typical young adolescent banter because \u201che takes things so literally.\u201d Brandon\u2019s mother had long seen this behavior as \u201ca little odd\u201d but added that it was not much different from that of Brandon\u2019s father, a successful attorney, who had similarly focused interests. Both of them were \u201csticklers for routine\u201d who \u201clacked a sense of humor.\u201d Brandon\u2019s mother noted that he made efforts to conceal his interest in trucks, cars, and trains outside of the home but would eagerly speak about them when encouraged. Brandon has shared with his mother that he tries to appear \u201cnormal\u201d when interacting with peers at school, which is exhausting. He often feels nervous around peers and generally tries to avoid socializing.\n\nOn examination, Brandon was shy and generally nonspontaneous. He made below-average eye contact. His speech was coherent and goal directed. At times, Brandon stumbled over his words, paused excessively, and sometimes rapidly repeated words or parts of words. Brandon said he felt okay but added that he was scared of school, particularly when around other children. He appeared sad, brightening only when discussing his toy cars. He denied current suicidal thoughts or plans as well as homicidality. He denied psychotic symptoms. He was cognitively intact.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, the user wants me to diagnose this 12-year-old boy based on the clinical vignette, following the DSM-5-TR criteria. I need to extract key information carefully. Brandon has temper tantrums, declining school performance, stomachaches on school mornings, and reluctance to go to school. He struggles socially\u2014mistrusts peers, takes things literally, has focused interests in vehicles, and avoids socializing because it's exhausting. His speech shows some stuttering or repetition. He's sad, anxious about school, and has thoughts of worthlessness but denies current suicidal ideation.\n\nHmm, the primary issue seems to be social communication deficits and restricted interests, which point toward Autism Spectrum Disorder. That would be the primary diagnosis. Then, the school avoidance and anxiety suggest Social Anxiety Disorder. His sadness and hopelessness might indicate Persistent Depressive Disorder. The speech issues\u2014stuttering\u2014could be Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder. Lastly, the temper outbursts and irritability might align with Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, though I need to check if the duration and frequency fit. \n\nWait, does DMDD require outbursts at least three times a week for a year? The vignette mentions recent months with multiple outbursts, but it's unclear if it's that frequent. Maybe it's better to consider Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood due to the school transition. Let me double-check the timeline: symptoms worsened after starting middle school, so Adjustment Disorder could fit. But the social deficits seem lifelong, so ASD is still primary. Yeah, Adjustment Disorder might be more appropriate than DMDD here. \n\nSo the list: Autism Spectrum Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, Persistent Depressive Disorder, Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder, and Adjustment Disorder. Make sure to include ICD-10 codes. Let me verify those codes... F84.0 for ASD, F40.10 for Social Anxiety, F34.1 for Persistent Depressive, F80.81 for Fluency Disorder, and F43.23 for Adjustment Disorder.

    "vignette":"Carlos was a 19-year-old Hispanic college student in his freshman year at a public university in a large city. He was referred by his guidance counselor to the hospital\u2019s outpatient psychiatric clinic for help with academic difficulties. Since starting college 6 months earlier, he had done poorly on tests and been unable to manage his study schedule. His worries that he was going to flunk out of college were leading to anxiety, insomnia, poor concentration, and a general sense of hopelessness. After a particularly tough week, he told his family that he thought he should quit. His mother accompanied him to the clinic that had previously helped both Carlos and his younger brother. The mother specifically wondered whether Carlos\u2019s \u201cADHD\u201d might be causing his problems, or whether he had outgrown it.\n\nCarlos had been seen at the same clinic when he was age 9, at which time he had been diagnosed with attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), predominantly combined type. Notes from that clinical evaluation indicated that Carlos had been in trouble at school for not following instructions, not completing homework, getting out of his seat, losing things, not waiting his turn, and not listening. He had trouble concentrating except in regard to video games, which he \u201ccould play for hours.\u201d Carlos had apparently been slow to talk, but his birth and developmental histories were otherwise normal. He repeated first grade because of behavioral immaturity and difficulty learning to read. The ease with which Carlos learned English, his second language, was not noted. His family had emigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic when he was 5 years old. The family was Catholic and attended church every Sunday. Both of his parents worked in maintenance and housekeeping at a local municipal hospital.\n\nDuring the evaluation when Carlos was age 9, a psychoeducational assessment by a clinical psychologist confirmed reading problems (particularly problems in reading fluency and comprehension). Carlos did not, however, meet the school board criteria for a learning disability, which required evidence of a 20-point discrepancy between IQ and achievement scores. Thus, he was not eligible for special education services. The evaluator had noted Carlos to be eager to do well and anxious about underperforming. His anxiety was thought to be a reaction to his school difficulties and his challenges in meeting the academic expectations of his family. Carlos\u2019s pediatrician had recommended pharmacotherapy, but his parents did not want to pursue medication. They cited negative experiences with local youth who used diverted controlled substances and hung out \u201con the street.\u201d Instead, his mother reported taking on an extra job to pay for tutors to help her son \u201cwith concentration and reading.\u201d The eldest of four siblings, Carlos had done well with this intervention and was now the first member of his family to attend college.\n\nThe psychiatry trainee carefully reviewed Carlos\u2019s academic history; his symptoms, including the course and severity of sadness, anxiety, insomnia, and hopelessness; and his social and developmental history. She obtained collateral history from his family and school records. She used the revised DSM-5-TR Core Cultural Formulation Interview for assistance in obtaining a better understanding of Carlos\u2019s acculturation experiences, the family\u2019s past feelings about the clinic\u2019s recommendations, and what treatment interventions would be relevant and acceptable to Carlos and his family.\n\nThe psychiatry trainee learned that Carlos had a childhood history of \u201cnervousness\u201d identified by a neighborhood curandera (traditional healer) as ataque de nervios. The family had addressed this problem with supportive prayer and a traditional herbal tea. They had apparently not revealed this to the psychiatrist at the time, thinking he would find it irrelevant and not wishing to seem disrespectful of his authority. During these unrevealed episodes of acute anxiety, Carlos would experience trembling and agitation, palpitations, shortness of breath, dread of harm, and fear of separation from caregivers. Workup by the pediatrician had revealed no physiological cause.\n\nSince starting college, Carlos reported that he had frequently been unable to remain focused while reading and listening to lectures. He was easily sidetracked and therefore had difficulty handing in his written assignments on time. He complained of feeling restless, agitated, and worried. He described difficulty falling asleep, poor energy, and an inability to \u201chave fun\u201d like his peers. He reported that the depressive symptoms went \u201cup and down\u201d over the course of the week and possibly influenced his problems with concentration; it was hard for him to be certain. He denied substance use.\n\nCarlos said that he\u2019d had some great teachers in high school who had understood him, helped him get the meaning of what he read, and allowed him to audiotape lectures and use other formats (e.g., videos, wikis, visual presentations) for final assignments. Without this support at college, he said he felt \u201clonely, stupid, a failure\u2014unable to cope.\u201d\n\nAlthough advised by his high school teacher to do so, Carlos had not registered with the university\u2019s student disability services office. He preferred not to be seen as different from his peers and thought he should be able to get through college by himself.\n\nCarlos\u2019s family history was positive for ADHD in a younger brother. A cousin was reported to have had \u201cdyslexia\u201d and had dropped out of a local community college after one semester. His social and developmental history revealed that he had been well liked by his cluster of friends throughout school. His group consisted of boys and girls and tended to consist of kids more interested in school than in sports. Carlos denied ever having dated or been sexually active, and he also denied having any significant interest in pursuing either of these activities.\n\nOn examination, Carlos was well-groomed, polite, and soft-spoken. He wore clean jeans, a T-shirt, and a hoodie that he kept pulling down over his face. He sat quietly and hunched over. He sighed a lot and rarely made eye contact with the clinician. He often tapped his fingers and shuffled in his seat but responded appropriately to questions. His command of English appeared strong, but he spoke with a slight Spanish accent. He often mumbled and mispronounced some multisyllabic words (e.g., he said \u201cliteralchure\u201d instead of \u201cliterature\u201d and \u201cintimate\u201d when he clearly meant \u201cintimidate\u201d). He denied any suicidal thoughts. He appeared motivated to do better. On a follow-up interview with the psychiatry trainee, Carlos asked whether the conversations were confidential. When informed that they were, he hesitantly admitted that he felt overwhelmed by new relationships with college peers. He indicated that \u201cin my neighborhood growing up, everybody was Dominican, but in college, I\u2019m the only Dominican.\u201d He also quietly said that he thought he might \u201clike guys rather than girls.\u201d He revealed two recent episodes of panic \u201clike when I was a kid\u201d that had occurred during social situations. He declined to go into further detail.\n\nAfter these two initial sessions, the psychiatrist suggested extending the evaluation so that they could optimize a treatment strategy. She told Carlos that she wanted to better understand his mood and anxiety symptoms, as well as how he felt about being the first in his family to go to college (i.e., role transitions), and to talk a little more about his concerns about his sexual orientation. She also referred Carlos for updated psychoeducational testing. This psychoeducational reassessment confirmed that Carlos\u2019s reading and writing abilities were substantially and quantifiably below those expected for his age. That report also concluded that these learning difficulties were not attributable to intellectual developmental disorder, uncorrected visual or auditory acuity, psychosocial adversity, or lack of proficiency in the language of academic instruction. The report concluded that Carlos had specific difficulties with reading fluency and comprehension as well as spelling and written expression.",

    "vignette":"Daphne, a 13-year-old in the ninth grade, was brought for a psychiatric evaluation because of academic and behavioral struggles. She had particular difficulty starting and completing schoolwork and following instructions, and she had received failing grades in math. When prompted to complete tasks, Daphne became argumentative and irritable. She had become increasingly resistant to attending school, asking to stay home with her mother. These difficulties had been evident since early childhood but had worsened significantly this year. Because Daphne had become increasingly distressed, her parents have been less insistent on making her do any activity that upsets her.\n\nPsychological testing indicated that Daphne had above-average intelligence, age-appropriate achievement in all subjects except math, and some difficulties in visuospatial skills. The test results were shared with the school, which offered additional tutoring. Daphne attended only a few sessions, stating that they were not helpful. Her parents talked to the school counselors and Daphne\u2019s teachers, asking for more services. They were told repeatedly that Daphne needed to be more assertive and ask for help. Several teachers commented that Daphne should be more motivated and try harder. Several years earlier, her pediatrician had diagnosed ADHD and prescribed a stimulant. She took the medication for a week, but her parents stopped giving it to her because she seemed agitated.\n\nAt home, Daphne\u2019s parents\u2019 close supervision of her homework often led to arguments with crying and screaming. Her behavior and attitude were noticeably better when she was out of school. She had two long-standing friends but had made no new close friends for several years. In groups with other children, she preferred to play with those younger than she. When her friends chose the activity or did not follow her rules, she tended to withdraw. She was generally quiet in groups and in school but more interactive with family members and individuals she knew well.\n\nSince early childhood, Daphne has had difficulty falling asleep, requiring a nightlight and parental reassurance. Recognizing that Daphne was easily upset by change, her parents rarely forced her into new activities. She did well during the summer, which she spent with her grandparents. Her parents reported no particular traumas, stressors, or developmental or medical problems. Daphne had started her menses about 2 months prior to the evaluation. Her family history was pertinent for multiple first- and second-degree relatives with mood, anxiety, or learning disorders.\n\nAt first meeting, Daphne was shy and tense. Her eye contact was poor, and she had difficulty talking about anything other than her plastic horse collection. Within 15 minutes, she became more comfortable, revealing that she disliked school because the work was too hard. She thought that other children did not seem to like her because she was stupid and was not into clothes and dating. Sometimes they made fun of her and would start laughing whenever the teacher called on her. There were several peers who had similar interests in animals and seemed okay. She has been eating lunch with them but found it hard to relax and to believe that they really wanted to be friends. Daphne was always afraid of making mistakes, getting bad grades, and disappointing everyone. Often, she was so preoccupied with what to say or do next that she did not pay attention to her peers or teachers. She frequently was unable to make a decision for fear of not being right. Daphne was unable to identify any personal strengths or any aspect of her life that was going well. She wished she had more friends and that she was smarter. As long as she could remember, she had always felt this way. These difficulties made her sad, but she denied persistent depressive feelings or suicidal thoughts. She appeared anxious but brightened when discussing her horse figurine collection, her longtime friends, and her family.",

Daphne has academic and behavioral struggles, difficulty with tasks, argumentative and irritable when prompted, and resistance to school. These issues have been present since early childhood but worsened recently. She has above-average intelligence but struggles with math and visuospatial skills. ADHD was previously diagnosed, but stimulant medication caused agitation. There are sleep difficulties, anxiety in social situations, fear of mistakes, and low self-esteem.

Next, Generalized Anxiety Disorder fits due to excessive worry about school performance and decision-making. Specific Learning Disorder with impairment in mathematics aligns with her math struggles. Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder, Predominantly Inattentive Presentation, is supported by her history of attention difficulties.

    "vignette":"Felicia Allen was a 32-year-old single woman brought to the emergency room (ER) by police after she apparently tried to steal a city bus in Chicago. Because she appeared to be an \u201cemotionally disturbed person,\u201d a psychiatry consultation was requested.\n\nAccording to the police report, Ms. Allen threatened the driver with a knife, took control of the almost empty city bus, and crashed it. A more complete story was elicited from a friend of Ms. Allen\u2019s who had been on the bus but who had not been arrested. According to her, they had boarded the bus on their way to a nearby shopping mall. Ms. Allen became frustrated when the driver refused her dollar bills, instead demanding exact change. She looked in her purse, but instead of finding exact change, she pulled out a kitchen knife that she carried for protection. The driver fled, so she got into the empty seat and drove the bus across the street into a nearby parked car.\n\nOn examination, Ms. Allen was a handcuffed, heavyset young woman with a bandage on her forehead. She fidgeted and rocked back and forth in her chair. She appeared to be mumbling to herself. When asked what she was saying, the patient made momentary eye contact and just repeated, \u201cSorry, sorry.\u201d She did not respond to other questions.\n\nMore information was elicited from a psychiatrist who had come to the ER soon after the accident. He said that Ms. Allen and her friend were longtime residents at the state psychiatric hospital where he worked. They had just begun to take passes every week as part of an effort toward social remediation; it had been Ms. Allen\u2019s first bus ride without a staff member.\n\nAccording to the psychiatrist, Ms. Allen had received a diagnosis of \u201cchildhood-onset, treatment-resistant paranoid schizophrenia.\u201d She had started hearing voices by age 5 years. Big, strong, intrusive, and psychotic, she had been hospitalized almost constantly since age 11. Her auditory hallucinations generally consisted of a critical voice commenting on her behavior. Her thinking was concrete, but when relaxed she could be self-reflective. She was motivated to please and recurrently said her biggest goal was to \u201chave my own room in my own house with my own friends.\u201d The psychiatrist said that he was not sure what had caused her to pull out the knife. She had not been hallucinating lately and had been feeling less paranoid, but he wondered if she had been more psychotic than she had let on. It was possible that she was just impatient and irritated. The psychiatrist also believed that she had spent almost no period of life developing normally and so had very little experience with the real world.\n\nMs. Allen had been taking clozapine for 1 year, with good resolution of her auditory hallucinations. She had gained 35 pounds on the clozapine, but she had less trouble getting out of bed in the morning and was functioning at a higher level. She was hoping to get a job and live more independently, and the bus trip had been intended as a step in that direction. Because of these improvements and goals, she had insisted on continuing to take the clozapine despite the weight gain.",

The police had been called by a professor who reported that Mr. Baker had walked into his classroom shouting, \u201cI am the Joker, and I am looking for Batman.\u201d When Mr. Baker refused to leave the class, the professor contacted security.\n\nAlthough Mr. Baker had much academic success as a teenager, his behavior had become increasingly odd during the past year. He quit seeing his friends and spent most of his time lying in bed staring at the ceiling. He lived with several family members but rarely spoke to any of them. He had been suspended from college because of lack of attendance. His sister said that she had recurrently seen him mumbling quietly to himself and noted that he would sometimes, at night, stand on the roof of their home and wave his arms as if he were \u201cconducting a symphony.\u201d He denied having any intention of jumping from the roof or having any thoughts of self-harm, but claimed that he felt liberated and in tune with the music when he was on the roof. Although his father and sister had tried to encourage him to see someone at the university\u2019s student health clinic, Mr. Baker had never seen a psychiatrist and had no prior hospitalizations.\n\nDuring the prior several months, Mr. Baker had become increasingly preoccupied with a female friend, Anne, who lived down the street. While he insisted to his family that they were engaged, Anne told Mr. Baker\u2019s sister that they had hardly ever spoken and certainly were not dating. Mr. Baker\u2019s sister also reported that he had written many letters to Anne but never mailed them; instead, they just accumulated on his desk.\n\nHis family said that they had never known him to use illicit substances or alcohol, and his toxicology screen was negative. When asked about drug use, Mr. Baker appeared angry and did not answer.\n\nOn examination in the ER, Mr. Baker was a well-groomed young man who was generally uncooperative. He appeared constricted, guarded, inattentive, and preoccupied. He became enraged when the ER staff brought him dinner. He loudly insisted that all of the hospital\u2019s food was poisoned and that he would only drink a specific type of bottled water. He was noted to have paranoid, grandiose, and romantic delusions. He appeared to be internally preoccupied, although he denied hallucinations. Mr. Baker reported feeling \u201cbad\u201d but denied depression and did not show disturbances in his sleep or appetite. He was adequately oriented to person and place but less so to time. He spoke articulately but refused formal cognitive testing. His insight and judgment were deemed to be poor.\n\nMr. Baker\u2019s grandmother had died in a state psychiatric hospital, where she had lived for 30 years. Her diagnosis was unknown. Mr. Baker\u2019s mother was reportedly \u201ccrazy.\u201d She had abandoned the family when Mr. Baker was young, and he was raised by his father and paternal grandmother.\n\nUltimately, Mr. Baker agreed to sign himself into the psychiatric unit, stating, \u201cI don\u2019t mind staying here.

His affect was blunted except when he became anxious while discussing his symptoms.\n\nMr. Coleman stated that he had come to the ER at his sister\u2019s suggestion. He said he could use a \u201cgeneral checkup\u201d because of several days of \u201cmigraines\u201d and \u201challucinations of a spiritual nature\u201d that had persisted for 3 months. His headache involved \u201csharp, shooting\u201d sensations in various bilateral locations in his head and a \u201cringing\u201d sensation along the midline of his brain that seemed to worsen when he thought about his vices.\n\nMr. Coleman described his vices as being \u201calcohol, cigarettes, disrespecting my parents, girls.\u201d He denied guilt, anxiety, or preoccupation with any of his military duties during his tour in Iraq, although his sister shared that Hakim\u2019s military responsibilities were of a confidential nature. He had joined an evangelical church 4 months earlier in the context of being \u201criddled with guilt\u201d about \u201call the things I\u2019ve done.\u201d Three months earlier, he began \u201chearing voices trying to make me feel guilty\u201d most days. The last auditory hallucination had been the day before. During these past few months, he became withdrawn and noticed that strangers were commenting on his past sins.\n\nMr. Coleman believed that his migraines and guilt might be due to alcohol withdrawal. He had been drinking three or four cans of beer most days of the week for several years until he \u201cquit\u201d 4 months earlier after joining the church. He still drank \u201ca beer or two\u201d every other week but felt guilty afterward. He denied alcohol withdrawal symptoms such as tremor and sweats. He had smoked cannabis up to twice monthly for years but completely quit when he joined the church. He denied using other illicit drugs except for one uneventful use of cocaine 3 years earlier. He sometimes would sleep only a few hours and did report some nightmares. Otherwise, Mr. Coleman denied depressive, manic, or psychotic symptoms and violent ideation.\n\nRegarding PTSD, Mr. Coleman\u2019s score on the 20-item self-administered PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 was below the cutoff score (between 31 and 33 out of 80) that would indicate probable PTSD in veterans. He denied that his military experience was unusually or especially frightening, horrible, or traumatic. Regarding other stressors, he felt overwhelmed by his current responsibilities, which included attending school and near-daily church activities. He had been a straight-A student at the start of the school year but was now receiving Bs and Cs.\n\nThe patient\u2019s girlfriend and sister were interviewed separately. They agreed that Mr. Coleman had become socially isolative and quiet, after having previously been fun and outgoing. He had also never been especially religious prior to this episode.

The user has provided a detailed scenario, and I need to diagnose based on DSM-5-TR criteria. First, I should extract all relevant information without adding anything extra.\n\nHakim is a 25-year-old veteran, now a student. He presents with headaches and hallucinations for three months. He mentions \"spiritual nature\" hallucinations, hears voices making him feel guilty, and believes strangers comment on his sins. He joined a church four months ago due to guilt over past behaviors like alcohol, smoking, disrespecting parents. \n\nHe drinks less now but still occasionally, no withdrawal symptoms. Cannabis use stopped, no other drugs. Sleep is sometimes reduced, some nightmares but denies other mood or psychotic symptoms. PTSD score is low, denies traumatic experiences. Socially withdrawn, academic decline noted. Girlfriend and sister confirm isolation, new religiosity. Medical tests normal.\n\nNow, organizing this data. Key symptoms: auditory hallucinations (voices commenting on guilt), delusional beliefs about strangers judging him, social withdrawal, blunted affect, increased speech latency. These are positive and negative symptoms of psychosis. Duration is three months, which is significant. No mood episodes, substance use seems unrelated as symptoms persist despite cutting down. Medical causes ruled out by normal CT and labs.\n\nPrimary diagnosis likely schizophrenia spectrum. Given the duration (3 months), hallucinations and delusions, plus negative symptoms like withdrawal and blunted affect, it fits schizophrenia. But wait, he has insight to some extent, calling them \"hallucinations of a spiritual nature.\" However, the fixed belief about strangers commenting on his sins seems delusional. \n\nSecondary diagnoses: Need to consider other psychotic disorders. Schizoaffective? He denies depressive or manic symptoms, so maybe not. Delusional disorder? But hallucinations are present, so that rules out pure delusional disorder. Substance-induced psychosis? He quit alcohol and cannabis before symptoms started, and urine tox is negative, so unlikely. PTSD with psychotic features? PTSD score is low, and he denies trauma, so probably not. \n\nWhat about obsessive-compulsive disorder with poor insight? He feels guilt over vices, but the hallucinations and delusions point more to psychosis. Religious preoccupation could be part of psychosis. Adjustment disorder? He's stressed with school and church, but psychotic symptoms go beyond that. \n\nSo, primary is schizophrenia. Next, secondary: maybe other specified schizophrenia spectrum disorder if full criteria not met, but he has >1 month of symptoms plus impairment, so schizophrenia fits. Then, consider alcohol use disorder (mild, given reduced drinking but guilt and prior regular use). Cannabis use disorder (mild, since he used twice monthly but quit). Maybe depressive symptoms? He denies depression, but guilt and withdrawal could hint at it, but psychotic symptoms are prominent. \n\nWait, the vignette says he denies depressive, manic, or psychotic symptoms. That's tricky\u2014he reports hallucinations but might not label them as psychotic. Still, based on DSM, auditory hallucinations are psychotic. So, schizophrenia is primary. \n\nLet's list top five: schizophrenia, alcohol use disorder, cannabis use disorder, possible PTSD despite low score, and adjustment disorder. But must only include psychiatric diagnoses with F-codes. \n\nFinal list: \n1. Schizophrenia - F20.9\n2. Alcohol Use Disorder, Mild - F10.10\n3. Cannabis Use Disorder, Mild - F12.10\n4. Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder (subthreshold PTSD) - F43.8\n5. Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood - F43.23\n\nDouble-check: He has psychotic symptoms >1 month, impairment, so schizophrenia. Alcohol and cannabis use disorders based on prior use and guilt. PTSD score low but some nightmares, so other specified. Adjustment due to stress from school\/church. Yes, that seems comprehensive.",

    "vignette":"John Evans was a 25-year-old single, unemployed white man who had been seeing a psychiatrist for several years for management of psychosis, depression, anxiety, and abuse of marijuana and alcohol.\n\nAfter an apparently normal childhood, Mr. Evans began to show dysphoric mood, anhedonia, low energy, and social isolation by age 15 years. At about the same time, Mr. Evans began to drink alcohol and smoke marijuana every day. In addition, he developed recurrent panic attacks, marked by a sudden onset of palpitations, diaphoresis, and thoughts that he was going to die. When he was at his most depressed and panicky, he twice received a combination of sertraline 100 mg\/day and psychotherapy. In both cases, his most intense depressive symptoms lifted within a few weeks, and he discontinued the sertraline after a few months. Between episodes of severe depression, he was generally seen as sad, irritable, and amotivated. His school performance declined around tenth grade and remained marginal throughout the rest of high school. He did not attend college as his parents had expected him to, but instead lived at home and did odd jobs in the neighborhood.\n\nAround age 20, Mr. Evans developed a psychotic episode in which he had the conviction that he had murdered people when he was 6 years old. Although he could not remember who these people were or the circumstances, he was absolutely convinced that this had happened, something that was confirmed by continuous voices accusing him of being a murderer. He also became convinced that other people would punish him for what had happened, and thus he feared for his life. Over the ensuing few weeks, he became guilt-ridden and preoccupied with the idea that he should kill himself by slashing his wrists, which culminated in his being psychiatrically hospitalized.\n\nAlthough he was predominantly anxious on admission, Mr. Evans soon became very depressed, with prominent anhedonia, poor sleep, and decreased appetite and concentration. With the combined use of antipsychotic and antidepressant medications, both the depression and the psychotic symptoms remitted after 4 weeks. Therefore, the total duration of the psychotic episode was approximately 7 weeks, 4 of which were also characterized by major depressive disorder. Mr. Evans had been hospitalized with the same pattern of symptoms two additional times before age 22, and each of these episodes started with several weeks of delusions and hallucinations related to his conviction that he had murdered someone when he was a child, followed by severe depression lasting an additional month. Both relapses occurred while he was apparently adherent to reasonable dosages of antipsychotic and antidepressant medications. During the 3 years prior to this evaluation, Mr. Evans had been adherent to clozapine and had been without hallucinations and delusions. He had also been adherent to his antidepressant medication and supportive psychotherapy, although his dysphoria, irritability, and amotivation never completely resolved.\n\nMr. Evans\u2019s history was significant for marijuana and alcohol misuse that began at age 15. Before the onset of psychosis at age 20, he smoked several joints of marijuana almost daily and binge-drank on weekends, with occasional blackouts. After the onset of the psychosis, he decreased his marijuana and alcohol use significantly, with two several-month-long periods of abstinence, yet he continued to have psychotic episodes up through age 22. He started attending Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous groups, achieved sobriety from marijuana and alcohol at age 23, and had remained sober for the 2 years prior to this evaluation.",

The patient has a longitudinal history with multiple overlapping symptoms - psychosis, mood disturbances, anxiety, and substance use.

The psychotic episodes have a consistent pattern: delusions and hallucinations lasting weeks, followed by major depression. Important that psychosis occurred even during substance abstinence periods after age 20.\n\nFor differential diagnosis, the recurrent brief psychotic episodes with mood symptoms suggest schizoaffective disorder as primary.

To commemorate the event, they decided to get tattoos. Afterward, they went to a nearby park, where Mr. Foster bought and smoked a marijuana cigarette. During the ensuing hour, Mr. Foster began to believe that the symbols in his tattoo had mysterious meaning and power. He became convinced that the tattoo artist was conspiring with others against him and that his wife was cheating on him. After returning to the hotel, the patient searched his wife\u2019s phone for evidence of her infidelity and threatened to jump out the window. The patient\u2019s wife, an ER physician, successfully convinced the patient to go to sleep, thinking that the episode would resolve.\n\nThe following day, the patient remained paranoid and delusional. He again threatened to jump out the window, and indicated that he would have no choice but to kill his wife the next time she slept. She called 911, and her husband was brought to the ER of a large nearby hospital. Later that day, he was admitted to an acute inpatient psychiatric unit with a diagnosis of unspecified psychotic disorder.\n\nMr. Foster had smoked cannabis sporadically from age 18 but began to smoke daily 5 years prior to this admission. In the past year, his cannabis use had steadily increased; previously he had been smoking once per day, but more recently his use had increased to three times a day, beginning when he awoke. He noted that he has begun to feel \u201canxious\u201d when not under the influence of cannabis and believed his thrice-daily use helped him \u201ceven out.\u201d The patient and his wife denied that he had ever used other illicit substances, and the patient indicated that he rarely drank alcohol. Until 1 year earlier, he had never seen a psychiatrist or been viewed by his friends and family as having significant psychiatric issues.\n\nIn the past year, however, Mr. Foster had been hospitalized four times for psychiatric problems. He had been hospitalized twice with classic manic symptoms and once for a suicidal depression. In addition, 7 months prior to this presentation, the patient had been hospitalized for a 6-week episode of cannabis-induced psychosis, which responded well to risperidone. At that time, his main symptom was paranoia. Two months prior to this admission, he entered a 1-month inpatient substance abuse treatment program for cannabis use disorder. Until the weekend of this admission, he had continued to smoke marijuana but had not used alcohol or any other substances since discharge from the rehabilitation facility. He had also been functioning well while taking lithium monotherapy for 3 months.\n\nMr. Foster had been steadily employed as a film editor since graduating from college. His father had a bipolar disorder, and his paternal grandfather committed suicide via gunshot but with an unknown diagnosis.\n\nOn the second day of hospitalization, Mr. Foster began to realize that his wife was not cheating on him and that the symbols in his tattoo were not meaningful. By the third day, he spontaneously said the paranoia was the result of cannabis intoxication. He declined further risperidone but continued lithium monotherapy. He was discharged with an appointment to follow up with his outpatient psychiatrist.",

    "vignette":"Lara Gonzalez, a 51-year-old divorced freelance journalist, brought herself to the emergency room requesting dermatological evaluation for flea infestation. When no corroborating evidence was found on skin examination and the patient insisted that she was unsafe at home, she was admitted to an inpatient psychiatric service with \u201cunspecified psychotic disorder.\u201d\n\nHer concerns began around 1 week prior to presentation. To contend with financial stress, she had taken in temporary renters for a spare room in her home and had begun pet sitting for some neighbors. Under these conditions, she perceived tiny insects burrowing into her skin and walls and covering her rugs and mattress. She had spent the 36 hours prior to presentation frantically cleaning her home, fearing that her tenants would not pay if they saw the fleas. She showered repeatedly, using shampoos meant to treat animal infestations, and she consulted three different exterminators, although none found evidence of fleas. She threw away a bag of clothing, believing she heard fleas \u201crustling and scratching inside.\u201d She bought replacement clothes that she kept in their own trash bag, thereby spending almost all of her savings, which worsened her preexisting financial strain.\n\nAside from her concerns about infestation, Ms. Gonzalez denied symptoms of depression, mania, and suspiciousness. She denied using any drugs or alcohol. No one in her family had a history of psychiatric illness. Ms. Gonzalez had been diagnosed with depression in college and briefly treated with an antidepressant. She had no relevant medical problems.\n\nHer worries about infestation began in the setting of her sister\u2019s diagnosis with invasive cancer, the onset of her own menopause, financial strain that was likely forcing her to move from the United States back to Argentina (her country of origin), and a recent breakup with her boyfriend. At baseline, she described herself as an obsessive person who had always had \u201ccontamination phobias\u201d that historically worsened during times of anxiety.\n\nOn mental status examination, Ms. Gonzalez was calm and easily engaged, with normal relatedness and eye contact. She offered up a small plastic bag containing \u201cfleas and larvae\u201d that she had collected in the hospital while awaiting evaluation. Inspection of the bag revealed lint and plaster. Her speech had an urgent quality to it, and she described her mood as \u201csad right now.\u201d She was tearful intermittently but otherwise smiling reactively. Her thoughts were overly inclusive and intensely focused on fleas. She expressed belief that each time a hair fell out of her head, it would morph into larvae. When crying, she believed an egg came out of her tear duct. She was not suicidal or homicidal. She expressed an unshakable belief that lint was larvae, and that she was infested. She denied hallucinations. Cognition was intact. Her insight was impaired, but her judgment was deemed reasonably appropriate.\n\nDermatological examination revealed no insects or larvae embedded in Ms. Gonzalez\u2019s skin. Results of neurological examination, head computed tomography scan, laboratory tests, and toxicology data were normal. She was discharged from the emergency room on a low-dose antipsychotic medication and seen weekly for supportive psychotherapy. Her preoccupation improved within days and resolved entirely within 2 weeks. She developed enough insight to refer to her belief that fleas were in her skin as a \u201ccrazy thought.\u201d She attributed her \u201cbreak from reality\u201d to multiple stressors, and was able to articulate that she relied on her delusion as a way to distract herself from real problems.

The patient presents with acute-onset delusional beliefs about flea infestation, but there are several nuanced features that need to be considered for accurate diagnosis.\n\nThe key elements I notice are: the delusions are somatic in nature (infestation), they developed acutely over one week in the context of multiple stressors, and they resolved completely within two weeks with low-dose antipsychotics. The patient has a history of obsessive traits and contamination phobias, but no prior psychotic episodes or family psychiatric history. \n\nFor the primary diagnosis, brief psychotic disorder seems most fitting given the acute onset, presence of delusions, and resolution within a month. The somatic delusions are prominent but don't fully align with delusional disorder's typical course. While the symptoms share features with OCD, the fixed delusional conviction pushes it toward psychotic spectrum. \n\nThe differential should include conditions that could present with similar symptoms: somatic symptom disorder for the focus on physical infestation, OCD given her contamination history, adjustment disorder due to the clear stressor relationship, and other specified psychotic disorder as a conservative alternative if duration criteria aren't fully met.",

The referral form indicated that the man was \u201cschizophrenic\u201d and an \u201cemotionally disturbed person.\u201d One of the police officers said that the man offered to pay them for sex while in the back seat of their patrol car. He referred to himself as the \u201cNew Jesus\u201d and declined to offer another name. He refused to sit and instead ran through the ER. He was put into restraints and received intramuscularly administered lorazepam 2 mg and haloperidol 5 mg. Intravenous diphenhydramine (Benadryl) 50 mg was readied in case of extrapyramidal side effects. The admitting team wrote that he had \u201cunspecified psychosis\u201d and transferred him to the psychiatry team that worked in the ER.\n\nDespite being restrained, the patient remained giddily agitated, talking about receiving messages from God. When asked when he had last slept, he said he no longer needed sleep, indicating that he had \u201cbeen touched by Heaven.\u201d His speech was rapid, disorganized, and difficult to understand. A complete blood count, blood chemistries, and a toxicology screen were drawn. After an additional 45 minutes of agitation, he received another dose of lorazepam. This calmed him, but he still did not sleep. The restraints were removed.\n\nAn hour after receiving the initial haloperidol and lorazepam, the patient was interviewed while he sat in a chair in the ER. He was an overweight African American man who was disheveled and malodorous. He did not smell of alcohol. He made poor eye contact, instead looking at nearby people, a ticking clock, the examiner, a nearby nurse\u2014at anything or anyone that moved. His speech was disorganized, rapid, and hard to follow. His leg bounced rapidly up and down, but he did not get out of his chair or threaten the interviewer. He described his mood as \u201cnot bad.\u201d His affect was labile. He often laughed for no particular reason but would get angrily frustrated when he felt misunderstood. His thought process was disorganized. He had grandiose delusions, and his perceptions were significant for \u201cGod talking to me.\u201d He denied other hallucinations and denied suicidal and homicidal ideation. When asked the date, he responded with an extended discussion about the underlying meaning of the day\u2019s date, which he missed by a single day. He remembered the names of the two police officers who had brought him to the hospital. He refused more cognitive testing. His insight and judgment appeared poor.\n\nThe patient\u2019s sister arrived an hour later, after having been called by a neighbor who had seen her brother, Mark Hill, being taken away in a police car. The sister said that her brother had seemed strange a week earlier, uncharacteristically arguing with relatives at a holiday gathering. He had claimed not to need sleep at that time and had been talking about his \u201cgifts.\u201d She had tried to contact Mr. Hill since then, but he had not responded to phone, e-mail, or text messages. She said he did not like to talk about his issues, but she had twice seen a bottle of olanzapine in his house. She knew their father had been called \u201cschizophrenic\u201d and \u201cbipolar,\u201d but she had not seen her father since she was a child. She said that Mr. Hill did not typically use drugs. She also said he was 34 years old and a middle school math teacher who had just finished a semester of teaching.\n\nA review of Mr. Hill\u2019s electronic medical record indicated that he had experienced a similar episode 2 years earlier. At that time, a toxicology screen had been negative. He had been hospitalized for 2 weeks on the inpatient psychiatric service and was given a discharge diagnosis of \u201cschizoaffective disorder\u201d; he also was prescribed olanzapine and referred to an outpatient clinic for follow-up. The chart had additionally referred to two previous admissions to the county inpatient hospital, but records from that hospital were not available after hours.\n\nOver the next 24 hours, Mr. Hill calmed significantly. He continued to believe that he was being misunderstood and that he did not need to be hospitalized. When asked, he agreed that he had a direct connection to God and \u201can important role on Earth,\u201d but he denied having a connection to anyone called the \u201cNew Jesus.\u201d His speech remained rapid and loud. The interviewer noted that he seemed easier to redirect, though his thoughts continued to jump from idea to idea. He remained tense and jumpy but denied paranoia or fear.\n\nSerial physical examinations revealed no abnormalities aside from blisters on his feet. The patient was not tremulous, and his deep tendon reflexes were symmetrical and graded 2 of 4. He showed no neurological asymmetry. His toxicology screen was negative and his blood alcohol level was zero. His initial lab results were pertinent for elevated blood urea nitrogen and a blood sugar level of 210 mg\/dL. His mean corpuscular volume, aspartate aminotransferase\/alanine aminotransferase ratio, and magnesium levels were normal. His BMI was 30.8.",

He noted that these \u201cdark periods\u201d had gone on as long as he had known her but that she had experienced at least a half dozen of these episodes in the prior year. He said they typically improved within a few weeks of restarting her fluoxetine. He added that he wondered whether alcohol and clonazepam worsened her symptoms, because she routinely ramped up their use when the dark periods began.\n\nMs. Ingram\u2019s husband said he had decided to bring her to the ER after he discovered that she had recently created a blog entitled Nancy Ingram\u2019s Best Stock Picks. Such an activity not only was out of character but also, given her job as a stock analyst for a large investment bank, was strictly against company policy. He said that she had been working on these stock picks around the clock, forgoing her own meals as well as her responsibilities at work and with her children. She countered that she was fine and that her blog would \u201cmake them as rich as Croesus.\u201d\n\nThe patient had first been diagnosed with depression in college, after the death of her father from suicide.

Since college, her mood had generally been \u201cdown,\u201d interspersed with recurrent bouts of worsened dysphoria, insomnia, and uncharacteristically rapid speech and hyperalertness. She had tried psychotherapy sporadically and taken a series of antidepressant medications, but her husband noted that the baseline depression persisted and that the dark periods were increasing in frequency.\n\nHer outpatient psychiatrist noted that Ms. Ingram appeared to have dysthymia (persistent depressive disorder) and recurrent major depressive disorder.

Ms. Jacobs had a history of mood symptoms that had been under good control with lithium and sertraline, but her depressive symptoms had returned soon after she had arrived in a new city for school, 3 months earlier. She had become preoccupied with ways in which she might kill herself without inconveniencing others. Her dominant suicidal thoughts involved shooting herself in the head while leaning out the window, so as not to cause a mess in the dorm. Although she did not have access to a gun, she spent time searching the Web for places where she might purchase one.\n\nMs. Jacobs\u2019s psychiatric history began at age 15, when she began to regularly drink alcohol and smoke marijuana, usually when out at dance clubs with friends. Both of these substances calmed her, and she denied that either had become problematic. She had used neither alcohol nor marijuana since starting graduate school.\n\nAround age 17, she began experiencing brief, intense depressive episodes, marked by tearfulness, feelings of guilt, anhedonia, hopelessness, low energy, and poor concentration. She would sleep more than 12 hours a day and neglect responsibilities at school and home.\n\nThese depressive episodes would generally shift after a few weeks into periods of increased energy, pressured speech, and unusual creativity. She would stay up most of the night working on projects and building architectural models. These revved-up episodes lasted about 5 days and were punctuated by feelings that her friends had turned against her and that they were not really friends at all. Worried especially about the paranoia, her family had brought her to a psychiatrist, who diagnosed her as having bipolar II disorder and prescribed lithium and sertraline. Although Ms. Jacobs\u2019s moods did not completely stabilize on this regimen, she did well enough at a local university to be accepted into a prestigious graduate program far from home. At that point the depression returned, and she became intensely suicidal for the first time.\n\nUpon evaluation, the patient was visibly depressed and tearful, and had psychomotor slowing. She said it was very difficult to get out of bed and she was not attending class most days. She reported hopelessness, poor concentration, and guilt about spending family money for school when she was not able to perform. She stated that she thought about suicide most of the time and that she had found nothing to distract her. She denied recent drinking or smoking marijuana, stating she did not feel like \u201cpartying.\u201d She acknowledged profound feelings of emptiness and indicated that she had occasionally cut her arms superficially to \u201csee what it would feel like.\u201d She stated that she knew that cutting herself in this way would not kill her. She reported depersonalization and occasional panic attacks. She denied having mood instability, derealization, problems with impulsivity, concerns about her identity, and fears of abandonment.",

    "vignette":"Pamela Kershaw was a 43-year-old married librarian who presented to an outpatient mental health clinic with a long history of episodic depressions. Most recently, she described depressed mood during the month since she began a new job. She said she was preoccupied with concerns that her new boss and colleagues thought her work was inadequate and slow and that she was unfriendly. She had no energy and enthusiasm at home, either, and instead of playing with her children or talking to her husband, she tended to watch television for hours, overeat, and sleep excessively. This had led to a 6-pound weight gain in just 3 weeks, which made her feel even worse about herself. She had begun to cry several times a week, which she reported as the sign that she \u201cknew the depression had returned.\u201d She had also begun to think often of death, although she had never attempted suicide.\n\nMs. Kershaw said her memory about her history of depressions was a little fuzzy, so she brought in her husband, who had known her since college. They agreed that she had first become depressed in her teens and that she had experienced at least five discrete periods of depression as an adult. These episodes generally included depressed mood, anergia, amotivation, hypersomnia, hyperphagia, deep feelings of guilt, decreased libido, and mild to moderate suicidal ideation without plan. Her depressions were often punctuated by periods of \u201ctoo much\u201d energy, irritability, pressured speech, and flight of ideas. These episodes of excess energy could last hours, days, or a couple of weeks. The depressed mood would not lift during these periods, but she would \u201cat least be able to do a few things.\u201d\n\nWhen specifically asked, Ms. Kershaw\u2019s husband described distinctive times when Ms. Kershaw seemed unusually excited, happy, and self-confident, and like a \u201cdifferent person.\u201d She would talk fast, seem energized and optimistic, do the daily chores very efficiently, and start (and often finish) new projects. She would need little sleep and still be enthusiastic the next day. Ms. Kershaw recalled these periods but said they felt \u201cnormal.\u201d In response to a question about hypersexuality, Ms. Kershaw smiled for the only time during the interview, saying that although her husband seemed to be including her good periods as part of her illness, he had not been complaining when she had her longest such episode (about 6 days) when they first started dating in college. Since then, she reported that these episodes were \u201cfairly frequent\u201d and lasted 2 or 3 days.\n\nBecause of her periodic low mood and thoughts of death, she had seen various psychiatrists since her mid-teenage years. Psychotherapy tended to work \u201cokay\u201d until she had another depressive episode, when she would be unable to attend sessions and would then just quit. Three antidepressant trials of adequate dosage and duration (6 months to 3 years) were each associated with short-term relief of depression, followed by relapse. Both alone and in the presence of her husband, Ms. Kershaw denied any history of alcohol or substance misuse. A maternal aunt and maternal grandfather had been recurrently hospitalized for mania, although Ms. Kershaw was quick to point out that she was \u201cnot at all like them.\u201d\n\nOn examination, Ms. Kershaw was a well-groomed, overweight woman who often averted her eyes and tended to speak very softly. No abnormal motor movements were noted, but her movements were constrained, and she did not use hand gestures. Her mood was depressed. Her affect was sad and constricted. Her thought processes were fluid, though possibly slowed. Her thought content was notable for depressive content, including passive suicidal ideation without evidence of paranoia, hallucinations, or delusions. Her insight and judgment were intact.",

The mother\u2019s chief concern was that \u201cRachel\u2019s meds aren\u2019t working.\u201d Rachel said she had no particular complaints.\n\nIn meetings with the patient and her mother, both together and separately, both reported that Rachel\u2019s grades had dropped from As and Bs to Cs and Ds, that she had lost many of her long-standing friends, and that conflicts at home had escalated to the point that her mother characterized her as \u201cnasty and mean.\u201d\n\nRachel first saw a psychiatrist at age 7 years when she was evaluated for attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) because of long-standing restlessness, impulsivity, and distractibility. After behavioral interventions were ineffective, the patient began treatment with a methylphenidate-based medication at age 8. Improvement was seen at school, in her social life, and at home. For the ensuing 6 years, Rachel had done well and was \u201cpretty much like other kids as long as she took her medicine.\u201d\n\nAt around age 14, however, Rachel became \u201cmoody.\u201d Instead of being a \u201cbubbly teenager,\u201d she would spend days by herself and hardly speak to anyone. During these periods of persistent sadness, she would sleep more than usual, complain that her friends didn\u2019t like her anymore, and not seem interested in anything. At other times, she would be a \u201choly terror\u201d at home, frequently yelling at her sister and parents to the point that everyone was \u201cwalking on eggshells.\u201d At about that time, Rachel\u2019s grades plummeted, and her pediatrician increased the dosage of her ADHD medication.\n\nRachel\u2019s family history was pertinent for a father who \u201chad real problems.\u201d Although her mother did not know his diagnosis, he had been treated with lithium. The father had left the family before Rachel was born, and the two had never met.\n\nIn exploring the periods of irritability, dysphoria, and social isolation, the clinician asked whether there had been times in which Rachel was in an especially good mood. The mother recalled multiple periods in which her daughter would be \u201cgiddy\u201d for a week or two. She would \u201claugh at anything\u201d and would enthusiastically help out with and even initiate household chores. Because these were the \u201cgood phases,\u201d the mother did not think these episodes were noteworthy.\n\nRachel had no general medical problems. She denied use of alcohol, illicit substances, and medications other than the prescribed ADHD medication.\n\nOn examination while alone, Rachel was a casually groomed teenager who was coherent and goal directed. She appeared wary and sad, with some affective constriction. She did not like how she had been feeling, saying she felt depressed for a week, then okay, then \u201chilarious\u201d for a few days, then \u201cmurderous,\u201d like someone was \u201cchurning up my insides.\u201d She did not know why she felt like that, and she hated not knowing how she would be feeling the next day.

The patient is a 15-year-old with a history of ADHD treated with methylphenidate since age 8, but now presenting with significant mood instability and functional decline over the past year.\n\nOkay, need to extract key data systematically. The core features include: cyclical mood episodes (persistent sadness with hypersomnia and anhedonia alternating with periods of giddiness and increased energy), severe irritability described as \"murderous\" feelings, academic and social deterioration, and family history of possible bipolar disorder in father treated with lithium. The methylphenidate dose increase didn't help, which is notable.\n\nFor diagnostic reasoning, the cyclical nature with distinct euphoric\/giddy periods lasting weeks points strongly toward bipolar spectrum. The description of rapid mood shifts within weeks suggests a cycling pattern. The severe irritability and \"churning\" internal state could indicate mixed features. ADHD remains relevant as a historical diagnosis. The social and academic decline could be accounted for by mood disorder, but differential should include conditions like disruptive mood dysregulation disorder given the age, though the clear episodic nature with euphoric periods argues against it.\n\nThe top diagnosis should capture the cyclical mood episodes with both depressive and distinct elevated phases. Bipolar I or II are possibilities, but with hospitalizations not mentioned and clear hypomanic episodes described, Bipolar II seems most precise. The mixed features specifier is important given the intense irritability. ADHD continues as a neurodevelopmental consideration.

    "vignette":"Sebastian Lopez, a 27-year-old Hispanic freelance editor, was brought to his long-time HIV clinic by his worried partner. As the patient entered the clinic waiting room, he announced, \u201cGod has cured me! I can stop my antivirals!\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. Lopez fidgeted on a chair, furiously writing on a yellow pad, his partner provided the recent history. He said that the patient had been doing well until approximately 1 month earlier. At that point, he began an unusually intense editing project. After about 10 days of little sleep, \u201cboundless energy,\u201d and activity, Mr. Lopez seemed edgy, a little pressured, and \u201cglassy-eyed.\u201d That night, the two of them went to a party to celebrate the completion of the work project. Despite several years of Narcotics Anonymous meetings and abstinence from illicit substances, Mr. Lopez took crystal methamphetamine, a stimulant. Acutely anxious and paranoid that they were being followed, Mr. Lopez drank three martinis but still did not sleep that night. Over the ensuing days the patient became less paranoid, but he appeared increasingly distracted and his speech was more pressured.\n\nMr. Lopez\u2019s work project was returned with multiple negative comments and requests for corrections. Instead of focusing on his editing, however, he stayed up late every night, intent on finding a cure for HIV. He made inappropriate, hypersexual advances toward other men at the gym, where he spent much of the day. He lost at least 5 pounds after deciding he should take vitamin supplements instead of food and his antiretroviral medication. He refused to go to the emergency room but finally agreed to come to his routine AIDS clinic appointment to show his doctors how well he had done despite not having taken his medications in over a month.\n\nMr. Lopez\u2019s psychiatric history was without a prior episode of clear-cut mania, but he had been depressed as a teenager during the early phase of his coming-out process. That episode was punctuated by a purposeful overdose and a 2-week psychiatric hospitalization and treatment with antidepressant medication and psychotherapy. Mr. Lopez had discontinued the medication because it made him \u201chyper and edgy,\u201d and he stopped the psychotherapy because \u201cit was pointless.\u201d He used methamphetamine frequently for several years, which led to recurrent unprotected intercourse with strangers.\n\nMr. Lopez was diagnosed with HIV at age 22, at which point he went to an outpatient substance use disorder rehabilitation center and discontinued his use of stimulants and alcohol. His lowest CD4 lymphocyte count had been 216 cells\/mm3, when he was age 24, at which time his viral load was 1.6 million copies. He had been reportedly adherent to his antiretroviral medications since then. His most recent CD4 count, 6 months prior to this episode, had been 526 cells\/mm3. His viral load had been undetectable. He had suffered fatigue but had not had any AIDS-defining illnesses. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain revealed mild cortical atrophy and periventricular white matter disease in excess of what would be expected for his age. The partner was unsure when Mr. Lopez had discontinued his antiretrovirals but thought it might have been months earlier. He also wondered if Mr. Lopez had \u201clost a step\u201d cognitively over the past year.\n\nHis family psychiatric history was significant for a maternal aunt who had received lithium and several courses of electroconvulsive therapy, but her diagnosis was unknown.\n\nOn examination, the patient was a sloppily dressed young man who told a pressured, disjointed story of events over the prior month. He was difficult to direct and was uncharacteristically irritable and devaluing. He was preoccupied with having discovered a cure for HIV through multivitamins and exercise. He denied hallucinations and suicidal and homicidal ideation. He refused cognitive testing, and his insight and judgment appeared poor.",

Her husband stated that she had been behaving very strangely and that she had become convinced that she had smothered and killed her baby.\n\nHer husband reported that after a normal pregnancy and uncomplicated delivery, Ms. Norman had happily gone home with their first child. On the third day after delivery, however, her mood and affect began to shift rapidly between elation and weepiness. She became irritable and anxious. She slept only an hour a night, even when her baby was asleep. Her behavior became increasingly bizarre, with overactivity and agitation. Her speech was rapid and digressive. Although not previously a religious person, she became convinced that God was speaking through her and that she had special powers that could solve the problems of the world. She told her husband that she could identify evil people by looking into their eyes and had begun to worry that she was surrounded by evil people, including her own mother. Most disturbing for her, whenever she was out of sight of her son, she became totally convinced that she had smothered him, and no one could convince her otherwise.\n\nMs. Norman had a history of three episodes of major depressive disorder in her teens and early 20s. These episodes resolved with psychotherapy and antidepressant medication. She also had a psychiatric admission for mania 3 years prior to the delivery of her child, after a flight from Asia to Europe. Following treatment with antipsychotic medication, she became depressed for several months. Although a diagnosis of bipolar disorder was discussed at this time, she was reluctant to accept this label, attributing the episode to stress and jet lag. She had discontinued the psychiatric medication in anticipation of getting pregnant.\n\nMs. Norman\u2019s own mother had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital shortly after the birth of her first child.

She had no history of illicit drug use and, prior to pregnancy, drank only 2 or 3 units of alcohol a week.\n\nOn mental status examination, Ms. Norman wandered around the room, seemingly unable to sit for more than a few moments. She was distractible and overtalkative, and demonstrated flight of ideas, flitting from one subject to another. Her mood was labile. At times she appeared happily euphoric. At other times she was tearful, and she could become quickly irritable when she felt she was not being understood. It was clear that she had a number of delusional beliefs but was unwilling to discuss most of them with the examiner. She did insist that she had already killed her own child, which led to several minutes of tears, but she returned to an edgy euphoria within a few minutes. She denied intent to harm herself or anyone else. She appeared inattentive, with poor concentration, but would not participate in formal cognitive testing.\n\nPhysical examination and laboratory testing results were all within normal limits.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the clinical case vignette about Ursula Norman. The user wants me to act as an expert psychiatrist and provide a structured list of DSM-5-TR diagnoses based only on the information given. I need to follow the rubric closely, even though the response shouldn't include the clinical reasoning.\n\nFirst, I'll extract the key details. Ursula is 32, a nurse, brought to the ER six days postpartum. Her husband reports strange behavior starting on day three after delivery. There's rapid mood shifts between elation and weepiness, irritability, anxiety, insomnia (only one hour of sleep), overactivity, agitation, rapid and digressive speech. She has new delusions: believing God speaks through her, having special powers, identifying evil people by their eyes, and being convinced she smothered her baby when out of sight. \n\nHer history includes three episodes of major depressive disorder in teens\/early 20s, treated with therapy and meds. Also, a psychiatric admission for mania three years prior after a flight, treated with antipsychotics, followed by depression. Bipolar disorder was considered but she attributed it to stress\/jet lag. She stopped meds before pregnancy. Family history: mother had a postpartum psychiatric hospitalization. No drug use, minimal alcohol. Mental status exam shows wandering, distractibility, overtalkativeness, flight of ideas, labile mood (euphoric to tearful to irritable), delusions including killing her child, inattention, poor concentration. Physical and labs normal.\n\nNow, organizing this info logically. The onset is acute postpartum (within days), with manic and psychotic symptoms. The history of past mania and depression points to bipolar disorder. The postpartum trigger is critical. DSM-5-TR includes specifiers for bipolar disorder with peripartum onset. The psychotic features are mood-congruent (delusions of guilt, grandiosity). \n\nDifferential diagnosis: Primary is likely Bipolar I Disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features, with peripartum onset. Secondary diagnoses should consider other conditions that could present similarly. Postpartum psychosis is often linked to bipolar disorder. Schizoaffective disorder is less likely given the clear mood episodes. Major depressive disorder with psychotic features doesn't fit the manic symptoms. Brief psychotic disorder might be considered but the history of mania leans more towards bipolar. Substance-induced psychosis isn't supported as there's no drug use and labs are normal. \n\nI need the top 5 diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes. Primary: Bipolar I Disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features, with peripartum onset. Code: F31.2 (Bipolar disorder, current episode manic severe with psychotic symptoms). Secondary: Postpartum psychosis often falls under bipolar, but if separate, maybe F53.1 (Severe mental and behavioral disorders associated with the puerperium, not elsewhere classified). However, DSM-5-TR doesn't have a separate code for postpartum psychosis; it's a specifier. So F53.1 might be used for other postpartum disorders. But since the user asked for DSM-5-TR diagnoses, I should stick to that. \n\nOther secondaries: Past major depressive disorder, recurrent, in remission? But the current episode isn't depressive, so maybe not listed. History of mania is part of bipolar. Perhaps adjustment disorder? No, symptoms are too severe. Anxiety disorders? Not prominent. Maybe rule out schizoaffective disorder. Or delusional disorder, but mood symptoms are primary. \n\nWait, the user says \"top 5 most likely diagnoses\" including primary and four secondaries. So besides bipolar, what else? Possibly: \n1. Bipolar I Disorder as primary.\n2. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in remission (from past history).\n3. Other specified bipolar and related disorder? But she had mania before.\n4. Postpartum psychosis as a separate entity? In DSM-5, it's not a standalone diagnosis; it's a specifier for mood episodes.\n5. Maybe psychotic disorder not otherwise specified? But with clear mood episodes, bipolar fits better.\n\nPerhaps secondaries include: \n- Past major depressive episodes.\n- The previous manic episode that led to depression could be considered part of bipolar, but since she didn't accept the diagnosis, maybe it's still relevant.\n- Anxiety symptoms are present but not primary.\n- Insomnia is part of mania.\n\nMaybe list: \n1. Bipolar I Disorder, current manic with psychotic features, peripartum onset.\n2. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in partial remission (since she had past episodes).\n3. Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood? But onset is postpartum and symptoms are severe, so unlikely.\n4. Brief Psychotic Disorder? But duration is days, and history suggests bipolar.\n5. Schizoaffective Disorder? But mood symptoms are predominant.\n\nGiven the rubric, I need to be nuanced. The primary is clear: Bipolar I, manic with psychosis, peripartum onset. Secondary diagnoses could include: \n- Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder (for postpartum psychosis if not bipolar)? But DSM-5-TR has code F28 (Other psychotic disorder not due to a substance or known physiological condition). \n- F53.1 is for puerperal psychosis in ICD-10, which might be used.\n\nThe user says \"DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses\" and \"ICD-10 F-codes\". So I need to map DSM diagnoses to ICD codes. For bipolar disorder, current manic severe with psychotic symptoms is F31.2. For major depressive disorder, recurrent, in remission, is F33.4. For postpartum onset specifier, there's no separate code; it's part of the bipolar diagnosis.\n\nPerhaps secondaries: \n2. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, in remission (F33.4)\n3. Other specified bipolar and related disorder? Not necessary if bipolar I is primary.\n4. Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition? But no medical condition.\n5. Insomnia disorder? But it's part of mania.\n\nMaybe consider: \n- Past history of major depressive disorder is relevant.\n- The previous manic episode could be considered part of bipolar, so not separate.\n- Postpartum depression with psychotic features? But she has mania, so bipolar.\n\nActually, in differential, one might consider: \n1. Bipolar I Disorder\n2. Postpartum psychosis (as a specifier, not separate diagnosis)\n3. Schizoaffective disorder\n4. Major depressive disorder with psychotic features\n5. Brief psychotic disorder\n\nBut based on likelihood, bipolar I is primary. Then, since she had past major depressive episodes, that could be listed. Also, the current episode has psychotic features, so maybe schizophreniaform disorder? No, duration is too short for schizophrenia.\n\nLet's list top 5: \n1. Bipolar I Disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features, with peripartum onset - F31.2\n2. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in remission (from past episodes) - F33.4\n3. Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder (for postpartum psychosis if not solely bipolar)? But DSM-5-TR code for other psychotic disorder is F28.\n4. Anxiety disorder unspecified? But anxiety is part of the presentation.\n5. Insomnia disorder? Not primary.\n\nPerhaps better: \n1. Bipolar I Disorder as above.\n2. Postpartum psychosis (F53.1 in ICD-10, which is for puerperal psychosis not elsewhere classified). But in DSM-5-TR, it's not a separate diagnosis.\n3. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, in partial remission.\n4. Adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct? Not fitting.\n5. Delusional disorder? But mood symptoms are prominent.\n\nGiven the history of past depression and mania, bipolar I is primary. Secondary might include: \n- Past major depressive disorder.\n- The current psychotic features could be emphasized.\n- Perhaps rule out substance-induced, but no evidence.\n- Maybe obsessive-compulsive disorder? But no.\n\nWait, the user says \"top 5 most likely diagnoses\". So besides bipolar, what else is likely? In postpartum onset, differential includes: \n- Bipolar disorder\n- Major depression with psychotic features\n- Brief psychotic disorder\n- Schizoaffective disorder\n- Delirium (but labs normal)\n\nSo: \n1. Bipolar I Disorder - F31.2\n2. Brief Psychotic Disorder - F23 (but duration >1 day, less than 1 month, and with stressor of childbirth). However, history of mania makes bipolar more likely.\n3. Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features - F32.3? But she has manic symptoms, so not.\n4. Schizoaffective Disorder, bipolar type - F25.0\n5. Delusional Disorder - F22\n\nBut based on likelihood, bipolar is first. Then, since she had past major depressive episodes, that could be secondary. Also, the postpartum onset could be coded separately? In ICD-10, F53.1 is for severe mental and behavioral disorders associated with the puerperium, not elsewhere classified. So perhaps: \n1. Bipolar affective disorder, current episode manic with psychotic symptoms - F31.2\n2. Mental and behavioral disorders associated with the puerperium, not elsewhere classified - F53.1\n3. Recurrent depressive disorder, in remission - F33.4\n4. Schizoaffective disorder, manic type - F25.0\n5. Brief psychotic disorder - F23\n\nBut I need to prioritize based on the vignette. The history of mania and depression points strongly to bipolar. The postpartum onset is a specifier. So primary is bipolar I. Secondary diagnoses could include: \n- Past major depressive disorder.\n- The psychotic features are part of bipolar, but if considering differential, schizoaffective is possible.\n- Postpartum psychosis is often synonymous with bipolar in this context.\n\nTo adhere to DSM-5-TR, I should list: \n1. Bipolar I Disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features, with peripartum onset - F31.2\n2. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in remission - F33.4\n3. Other Specified Bipolar and Related Disorder? Not if bipolar I is confirmed.\n4. Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder (for postpartum psychosis if not bipolar) - F28\n5. Anxiety Disorder Not Otherwise Specified? But anxiety is present.\n\nPerhaps better to list differentials that are relevant: \n- Bipolar I (primary)\n- Major depressive disorder (past history)\n- Brief psychotic disorder (rule out)\n- Schizoaffective disorder (rule out)\n- Delusional disorder (rule out)\n\nBut the user wants \"top 5 most likely diagnoses\", so including the primary and four secondaries. Secondary might be other conditions she has or differentials.\n\nGiven her history, she has past major depressive disorder, which is in remission. Also, the current episode could be considered postpartum psychosis, which in ICD-10 has a code F53.1. In DSM-5-TR, postpartum psychosis is not a separate diagnosis; it's a specifier for mood or psychotic disorders. So if I list it as a diagnosis, it might not be DSM-5-TR. The user says \"DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses\", so I should use DSM categories.\n\nSo for DSM-5-TR: \n1. Bipolar I Disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features, with peripartum onset.\n2. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in remission (from past episodes).\n3. Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder (if considering postpartum psychosis not better accounted for by bipolar). But since bipolar fits, this is less likely.\n4. Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood? But symptoms are too severe.\n5. Insomnia Disorder? Not primary.\n\nMaybe list: \n1. Bipolar I Disorder - F31.2\n2. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in remission - F33.4\n3. Other Specified Bipolar and Related Disorder? No.\n4. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder - F41.9\n5. Unspecified Psychotic Disorder - F29\n\nBut that seems forced.\n\nLooking at the vignette, the key is postpartum onset with manic and psychotic symptoms. History of mania and depression. So bipolar I is primary. Past major depressive episodes are secondary. The differential might include: \n- Postpartum psychosis (F53.1 in ICD-10, which is for mental disorders associated with the puerperium, not elsewhere classified). In DSM-5, this falls under other specified bipolar or psychotic disorder if not meeting criteria for a specific disorder. But here, it meets bipolar criteria.\n\nPerhaps: \n1. Bipolar I Disorder - F31.2\n2. Mental and behavioral disorders associated with the puerperium, not elsewhere classified - F53.1 (as a secondary diagnosis for the postpartum onset)\n3. Recurrent depressive disorder, in remission - F33.4\n4. Schizoaffective disorder, manic type - F25.0 (as a rule-out)\n5. Brief psychotic disorder - F23 (as a rule-out)\n\nBut I need to base only on info provided. She has bipolar I, past MDD, and the postpartum specifier. Maybe the top 5 are: \n1. Bipolar I Disorder - F31.2\n2. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in remission - F33.4\n3. Anxiety Disorder Not Otherwise Specified - F41.9 (since she has anxiety)\n4. Insomnia Disorder - F51.01 (but due to bipolar)\n5. Other Specified Psychotic Disorder - F28 (for postpartum psychosis)\n\nHowever, anxiety and insomnia are symptoms of mania, so not separate diagnoses.\n\nGiven the rubric, I should be nuanced. But the user says not to output clinical reasoning, just the list. So I'll go with: \n1. Bipolar I Disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features, with peripartum onset - F31.2\n2. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in remission - F33.4\n3. Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder (Postpartum Psychosis) - F28\n4. Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type - F25.0\n5. Brief Psychotic Disorder - F23\n\nBut is Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum correct? In DSM-5-TR, other specified schizophrenia spectrum includes conditions like persistent auditory hallucinations without other symptoms, etc. Postpartum psychosis is usually coded under bipolar or major depression with psychotic features, or as brief psychotic disorder if less than 1 month. Here, duration is 6 days, so brief psychotic disorder is possible, but history of mania makes bipolar more likely.\n\nPerhaps list: \n1. Bipolar I Disorder - F31.2\n2. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in remission - F33.4\n3. Brief Psychotic Disorder - F23\n4. Schizoaffective Disorder - F25.0\n5. Delusional Disorder - F22\n\nOrder by likelihood: bipolar first, then past MDD, then brief psychotic as alternative, schizoaffective, delusional.\n\nBut the user wants the top 5 most likely, including primary and secondaries. Secondary diagnoses might be other conditions she has, not just differentials. She has past MDD, so that's secondary. She might have anxiety, but not diagnosed. The postpartum psychosis could be considered, but in DSM-5, it's not a separate code.\n\nI recall that in ICD-10, F53.1 is for severe mental and behavioral disorders associated with the puerperium, not elsewhere classified. This can be used for postpartum psychosis when it doesn't meet criteria for other disorders. But here, it meets bipolar criteria, so bipolar takes precedence.\n\nHowever, for the list, I can include it as a secondary diagnosis if relevant.\n\nLet's check DSM-5-TR codes: \n- Bipolar I Disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features: F31.2\n- Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in remission: F33.4\n- Brief Psychotic Disorder: F23\n- Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type: F25.0\n- Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder: F28\n\nPerhaps for postpartum psychosis, if not specified elsewhere, F53.1 is used in ICD-10, but that's not an F-code in the schizophrenia spectrum? F53 is in \"Mental and behavioral disorders associated with the puerperium\", so it is an F-code. The user says \"ICD-10 F-codes\", so F53.1 is valid.\n\nSo: \n1. Bipolar I Disorder - F31.2\n2. Mental and behavioral disorders associated with the puerperium, not elsewhere classified - F53.1\n3. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in remission - F33.4\n4. Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type - F25.0\n5. Brief Psychotic Disorder - F23\n\nBut is F53.1 a psychiatric diagnosis? Yes, in ICD-10. In DSM-5-TR, there is no equivalent; it's covered by other diagnoses. The user says \"DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses\" but then \"ICD-10 F-codes\". So I need to provide DSM diagnoses with corresponding ICD codes. For DSM, postpartum psychosis is not a separate diagnosis; it's a specifier. So I shouldn't list it separately if I already have bipolar with peripartum specifier.\n\nTherefore, only list DSM diagnoses. So for DSM: \n- Bipolar I Disorder with peripartum onset is one diagnosis.\n- Past major depressive disorder is another.\n- For differential, but since she likely has bipolar, the others are rule-outs.\n\nThe user says \"top 5 most likely diagnoses\", so including differentials. So: \n1. Bipolar I Disorder - F31.2\n2. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in remission - F33.4\n3. Brief Psychotic Disorder - F23\n4. Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type - F25.0\n5. Delusional Disorder - F22\n\nBut delusional disorder is less likely due to mood symptoms.\n\nMaybe include: \n- Other Specified Bipolar and Related Disorder? Not if bipolar I fits.\n- Unspecified Anxiety Disorder? Not primary.\n\nGiven the clinical picture, the primary is bipolar I. The past MDD is secondary. The current episode could be considered postpartum psychosis, which in DSM might be coded as Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum if not meeting criteria for bipolar, but here it does. So for top 5, I'll go with bipolar I, past MDD, and then three differentials: brief psychotic, schizoaffective, and delusional.\n\nBut let's see the vignette: history of mania, so bipolar is likely. Postpartum onset is a specifier. So for the list: \n1. Bipolar I Disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features, with peripartum onset - F31.2\n2. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in remission - F33.4\n3. Brief Psychotic Disorder - F23\n4. Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type - F25.0\n5. Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder - F28\n\nI think that covers it. I'll proceed with that.",

    "vignette":"Victoria Owens, a divorced 58-year-old event planner, scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist for help with anxiety and depression. Ms. Owens arrived at the appointment well dressed and a little agitated. Speaking at a normal pace, she explained that her depressive symptoms had begun 2 years earlier in the setting of initiating divorce proceedings from her fourth husband. She described poor mood, incapacitating worry about her future, and poor concentration. These symptoms progressed to anhedonia, decreased energy, hypersomnia with interrupted sleep, passive suicidal ideation, and increased appetite with carbohydrate craving. She stopped going to work as an event planner and began spending most of the day in bed.\n\nMs. Owens initially sought treatment from a homeopath, who prescribed a variety of remedies that were not helpful. She eventually saw her internist, who prescribed alprazolam 0.25 mg three times a day as needed. This medication reduced her worry but had little effect on her mood. Her internist then initiated sertraline 50 mg\/day, increasing the dosage (as tolerated) to 200 mg\/day. Over the ensuing 2 months, Ms. Owens\u2019s sleep improved and she no longer experienced suicidal thoughts. However, she became more anxious, irritable, agitated, and energized and noted that her thoughts moved rapidly. She denied impulsivity and psychotic symptoms.\n\nMs. Owens had a long-standing history of similar depressive episodes. The first such episode occurred during college, lasted for several months, and was untreated.\n\nWhen specifically asked, she described multiple periods in her life when she had moderately elevated mood, rapid thoughts, and increased energy. It seemed that many important life accomplishments occurred during these periods. For instance, as a young, recently divorced unemployed single mother, she agreed to throw a bridal shower for her best friend. She pored over bridal and craft magazines, determined to create a fabulous party on a shoestring budget. She became totally engrossed in the project, seeming to have abundant energy and ideas. The shower was a huge success and launched Ms. Owens\u2019s career as a party planner. She hid her mood swings from her clients and colleagues, leveraging her elevated mood states to project a high-energy \u201cface,\u201d but then would retreat and avoid work when her mood became low. She also became more irritable during these high-energy episodes, and she believed that each of her marriages both began and ended because of her tendency to \u201cget emotional\u201d when she was in these elevated mood states. Although these periods could last for many weeks, she did not experience changes in sleep, engage in risky behaviors, speak quickly, or become grandiose, and she saw nothing problematic about them.\n\nMs. Owens also reported that she drank heavily when she was in her 40s but rarely did so now. She denied prior suicide attempts and psychiatric hospitalizations. Her mother had been treated for depression with sertraline, and her brother was treated with lithium for bipolar disorder.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, the user wants me to explain the thought process behind the assistant's response for the given clinical case vignette. Let me start by carefully reading the vignette again to understand the key details.\n\nFirst, I need to extract and organize the relevant information. Victoria Owens is a 58-year-old event planner presenting with anxiety and depression. Her depressive episode started two years ago during divorce proceedings, with symptoms like poor mood, worry, anhedonia, hypersomnia, increased appetite, and passive suicidal ideation. She had a partial response to sertraline but developed increased anxiety, irritability, agitation, and rapid thoughts. \n\nLooking at her history, there are recurrent depressive episodes since college and periods of elevated mood, rapid thoughts, and increased energy that helped her achieve goals but without full manic criteria like decreased sleep or grandiosity. Her brother has bipolar disorder treated with lithium, which is a strong family history clue. \n\nNow, considering DSM-5-TR criteria, the primary diagnosis should consider both the depressive episodes and the hypomanic episodes. Bipolar II disorder fits because she has major depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes without full mania. The hypomanic episodes here include elevated mood, increased energy, rapid thoughts, and irritability, lasting weeks but not severe enough to cause marked impairment or psychosis. \n\nFor secondary diagnoses, persistent depressive disorder is likely given the long-standing depressive episodes. Generalized anxiety disorder is considered due to her chronic worry. Alcohol use disorder in remission fits her past heavy drinking. Adjustment disorder is listed because the initial episode was triggered by divorce, though it evolved into a more chronic condition. \n\nI need to ensure the differentials are prioritized correctly based on the vignette. The family history of bipolar disorder supports bipolar II as primary. Other conditions like cyclothymic disorder or personality disorders aren't supported because the symptoms are episodic, not chronic, and there's no evidence of personality pathology. \n\nFinally, I double-check the ICD-10 codes to ensure they match the diagnoses correctly. The response lists each diagnosis with the corresponding F-code, which aligns with the user's request for a structured list without additional reasoning.",

Most recently, Wyatt had smashed a closet door to gain access to a video game that had been withheld to encourage him to do homework. At school, Wyatt was noted to have a hair-trigger temper, and he had recently been suspended for punching another boy in the face after losing a chess match.\n\nWyatt had been an extremely active young boy, running \u201call the time.\u201d He was also a \u201csensitive kid\u201d who constantly worried that things might go wrong. His tolerance for frustration had been less than that of his peers, and his parents quit taking him shopping because he would predictably become distraught whenever they did not buy him whatever toys he wanted.\n\nGrade school reports indicated fidgetiness, wandering attention, and impulsivity. When Wyatt was 10 years old, a child psychiatrist diagnosed him as having attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), combined type. Wyatt was referred to a behavioral therapist and started taking methylphenidate, which led to an improvement in his symptoms. However, by fourth grade, his moodiness became more pronounced and persistent. He was generally surly, complaining that life was \u201cunfair.\u201d Wyatt and his parents began their daily limit-setting battles at breakfast while he delayed getting ready for school, and then\u2014by evening\u2014continued their arguments about homework, video games, and bedtime. These arguments often included Wyatt screaming and throwing nearby objects. By the time he reached sixth grade, his parents were tired and his siblings avoided him.\n\nAccording to Wyatt\u2019s parents, he had no problems with appetite, and although they fought about when he would go to bed, he did not appear to have a sleep disturbance. He appeared to find pleasure in his usual activities, maintained good energy, and had no history of elation, grandiosity, or decreased need for sleep lasting more than a day. Although they described him as \u201cmoody, isolated, and lonely,\u201d his parents did not see him as depressed. They denied any history of hallucinations, abuse, trauma, suicidality, homicidality, a wish to self-harm, or any premeditated wish to harm others. He and his parents denied he had ever used alcohol or drugs. His medical history was unremarkable. His family history was notable for anxiety and depression in the father, alcoholism in the paternal grandparents, and possible untreated ADHD in the mother.\n\nOn interview, Wyatt was mildly anxious yet easy to engage. His body twisted back and forth as he sat in the chair. In reviewing his temper outbursts and physical aggression, Wyatt said, \u201cIt\u2019s like I can\u2019t help myself. I don\u2019t mean to do these things. But when I get mad, I don\u2019t think about any of that. It\u2019s like my mind goes blank.\u201d When asked how he felt about his outbursts, Wyatt looked very sad and said earnestly, \u201cI hate when I\u2019m that way.\u201d If he could change three things in his life, Wyatt replied, \u201cI would have more friends, I would do better in school, and I would stop getting mad so much.\u201d",

The user wants a structured list of DSM-5-TR diagnoses based solely on the provided information, following specific formatting. \n\nOkay, let me break this down. Wyatt is a 12-year-old boy with a history of ADHD, but now presenting with severe emotional dysregulation, explosive outbursts, and persistent irritability. The key features are: chronic irritability since age 10, frequent severe temper outbursts (verbal aggression, property destruction, physical aggression), impairment across multiple settings (home and school), and distress about his own behavior. \n\nThe absence of discrete manic episodes rules out bipolar disorder. The chronic nature and lack of distinct mood episodes point toward disruptive mood dysregulation disorder as primary. His ADHD diagnosis is well-established and still relevant. The anxiety traits and family history suggest possible anxiety disorder. The aggression and rule-breaking behaviors, though seemingly reactive, warrant consideration of oppositional defiant disorder. The school conflicts and peer problems might indicate adjustment issues.\n\nWait, I need to ensure these are listed in correct priority order with proper ICD-10 codes. DMDD comes first given the chronic irritability and outbursts. Then ADHD as a pre-existing condition. ODD is relevant given the pattern of anger\/irritability. The anxiety and adjustment issues are secondary considerations.\n\nLet me double-check the codes: DMDD is F34.8, ADHD is F90.2, ODD is F91.3, anxiety unspecified is F41.9, and adjustment disorder is F43.25.

She was referred by her breastfeeding nurse, who was concerned about the patient\u2019s depressed mood, flat affect, and fatigue.\n\nMs. Perez said she had been worried and unenthusiastic since finding out she was pregnant. She and her husband planned to wait a few years before having another child, and her husband made it clear that he would have preferred that she terminate the pregnancy, an option she would not consider because of her religion. He had also been upset that she was \u201ctoo tired\u201d to do paid work outside of the home during her pregnancy. She became increasingly dysphoric, hopeless, and overwhelmed after the delivery. Breastfeeding was not going well, and she began to believe her baby was \u201crejecting me\u201d by refusing her breast, spitting up her milk, and crying. Her baby became very colicky, so she felt forced to hold him most of the day. She wondered whether she deserved this difficulty because she had not wanted the pregnancy.\n\nHer husband was gone much of the time for work, and she found it very difficult to take care of the new baby and her lively and demanding 16-month-old daughter. Over the past several weeks she slept little, felt constantly tired, cried often, and worried about how she was going to get through the day.

The postpartum onset and breastfeeding difficulties strongly point to a mood disorder with peripartum onset.\n\nBut wait, there are important contextual factors: marital stress, recent relocation isolating her from family support, and possible genetic predisposition to depression. The mental status exam shows psychomotor slowing and cognitive deficits, which could indicate severity.

Adjustment disorder is possible but depressive symptoms appear disproportionate to stressors. Anxiety should be considered given worry content.

The young man, who had struggled with major depressive disorder and substance use disorder, had been found surrounded by several emptied pill bottles and an incoherent suicide note.\n\nMr. Quinn had been very close to his troubled son, and he immediately felt crushed, like his life had lost its meaning. In the ensuing 2 weeks, he had constant images of his son and was \u201cobsessed\u201d with how he might have prevented the substance abuse and suicide. He worried that he had been a bad father and that he had spent too much time on his own career and too little time with his son. He felt constantly sad, withdrew from his usual social life, and was unable to concentrate on his work. Although he had never previously drunk more than a few glasses of wine per week, he increased his alcohol intake to half a bottle of wine each night. At that time, his psychiatrist told him that he was struggling with grief and that such a reaction was normal. They agreed to meet for support and to assess the ongoing clinical situation.\n\nMr. Quinn returned to see his psychiatrist weekly. By the sixth week after the suicide, his symptoms had worsened. Instead of thinking about what he might have done differently, he became preoccupied that he should have been the one to die, not his young son. He continued to have trouble falling asleep, but he also tended to awake at 4:30 a.m. and just stare at the ceiling, feeling overwhelmed with fatigue, sadness, and feelings of worthlessness. These symptoms improved during the day, but he also felt a persistent and uncharacteristic loss of self-confidence, sexual interest, and enthusiasm. He asked his psychiatrist whether he still had normal grief or had major depressive disorder.\n\nMr. Quinn had a history of two prior major depressive episodes that improved with psychotherapy and antidepressant medication, but no significant depressive episodes since his 30s.

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, I need to diagnose Andrew Quinn based on this clinical vignette. Let me start by extracting all the relevant information carefully. The patient is a 60-year-old businessman who lost his son to suicide two weeks before the initial visit. The son had major depressive disorder and substance use disorder. Mr. Quinn's initial reaction includes constant images of his son, obsession with preventing the suicide, self-blame, withdrawal, sadness, poor concentration, and increased alcohol use. His psychiatrist initially thought it was normal grief.\n\nBy the sixth week, symptoms worsened. He now has preoccupation with wanting to die instead of his son, early morning awakening, fatigue, sadness, worthlessness, anhedonia (loss of sexual interest and enthusiasm), and loss of self-confidence. There's a diurnal pattern with symptoms improving during the day. He has a history of two prior major depressive episodes treated with therapy and meds, but no episodes since his 30s. No personal history of substance use disorders, but increased alcohol use recently. Family history of depression in both parents.\n\nNow, organizing this data. Key timeline: symptoms started after son's death, worsened by week six. Current symptoms meet criteria for a major depressive episode: depressed mood, anhedonia, sleep disturbance (early morning awakening), fatigue, worthlessness, impaired concentration. The preoccupation with death and wanting to die instead of his son suggests suicidal ideation without intent? Hmm, he thinks he should have died, but no active plan mentioned. The increased alcohol use is a new issue.\n\nDifferential diagnosis: Primary is likely Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent episode, given prior history and current symptoms. But need to rule out adjustment disorder, persistent complex bereavement disorder (Prolonged Grief Disorder in DSM-5-TR?), and substance-induced depressive disorder due to increased alcohol use.\n\nWait, DSM-5-TR has Prolonged Grief Disorder as a new diagnosis. The vignette says six weeks post-loss. Criteria for Prolonged Grief Disorder require at least 12 months for adults, so it's too early. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood is possible, but the severity and symptoms suggest MDD. Alcohol Use Disorder might be developing given increased intake, but no dependency symptoms mentioned yet.\n\nAlso, the history of past MDD episodes makes recurrent MDD more likely. The current episode is severe with melancholic features? Early morning awakening, diurnal variation, anhedonia, guilt\u2014yes, melancholic features present.\n\nSo, primary diagnosis: Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, severe with melancholic features. Secondary: Adjustment disorder? But MDD takes precedence. Alcohol Use Disorder, mild, given increased use but no other criteria. Prolonged Grief Disorder not yet applicable. Maybe Uncomplicated Bereavement as V-code, but not an F-code. So, top five: MDD, Alcohol Use Disorder, Persistent Depressive Disorder? No, because current episode is major depression. Maybe Other Specified Depressive Disorder? No, MDD fits.\n\nSecondary diagnoses: Alcohol Use Disorder, mild; Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood; Prolonged Grief Disorder (but not meeting duration); and maybe Rule Out PTSD? No trauma symptoms mentioned. Anxiety disorders? Not prominent.\n\nGiven the vignette, top five F-code diagnoses: \n1. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent episode, severe with melancholic features - F33.2\n2. Alcohol Use Disorder, mild - F10.10\n3. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood - F43.21\n4. Prolonged Grief Disorder - F43.81 (but needs 12 months, so maybe other specified trauma disorder? Wait, DSM-5-TR code for Prolonged Grief Disorder is F43.81, and criteria allow for diagnosis if symptoms persist beyond 12 months, but here it's only 6 weeks. However, the vignette mentions worsening at 6 weeks, so it might be considered if symptoms are severe and persistent. But typically, it's not diagnosed until after 12 months. So maybe not.)\nWait, the patient is asking if it's normal grief or MDD. So, Uncomplicated Bereavement is a V-code, not F-code. So, maybe Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder for acute grief reaction? Code F43.8.\n\nAlternatively, since he has history of depression, MDD is primary. Secondary could be Alcohol Use Disorder, Adjustment Disorder, Other Specified Depressive Disorder? No, MDD covers it. Maybe Persistent Complex Bereavement Disorder, but that's now Prolonged Grief Disorder in DSM-5-TR. Given the duration, it might be considered if symptoms are severe, but usually not diagnosed before 12 months. However, for differential, it can be included.\n\nWait, the rubric says top 5 most likely diagnoses. So:\n1. MDD, recurrent, severe with melancholic features - F33.2\n2. Alcohol Use Disorder, mild - F10.10\n3. Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood? But depression is primary, so F43.21\n4. Prolonged Grief Disorder - F43.81 (even though duration insufficient, it's a consideration)\n5. Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder - F43.8 for acute grief reaction\n\nBut need to base only on info given. He has symptoms of depression, alcohol use, grief. No psychosis, no mania, no anxiety disorders mentioned. So, sticking to these.\n\nEnsure codes are correct: \n- F33.2 for MDD recurrent, severe without psychotic features\n- F10.10 for Alcohol Use Disorder, mild\n- F43.21 for Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood\n- F43.81 for Prolonged Grief Disorder\n- F43.8 for Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder\n\nBut Prolonged Grief Disorder requires persistent grief beyond 12 months, so maybe not. However, in clinical practice, it might be considered if symptoms are severe, but for accuracy, since it's only 6 weeks, it shouldn't be diagnosed. So, perhaps replace with Other Specified Depressive Disorder? But MDD already covers depression. Maybe Rule Out PTSD, but no trauma symptoms. So, maybe only 4 diagnoses? The instruction says top 5, so include all relevant.\n\nAlternatively, since he has history of MDD, current episode is MDD. Secondary: Alcohol Use Disorder, Adjustment Disorder, Bereavement (V-code), but not F-code. So, for psychiatric F-code diagnoses, maybe: MDD, Alcohol Use Disorder, Adjustment Disorder, Unspecified Depressive Disorder? No. \n\nWait, he has increased alcohol use but no criteria for Alcohol Use Disorder? Mild requires 2-3 symptoms. He has increased use, but no other criteria like tolerance, withdrawal, etc. So, maybe Alcohol Use Disorder not yet, but risky use. So, maybe Unspecified Alcohol-Related Disorder F10.9? But better to include as mild.\n\nGiven the vignette, \"increased his alcohol intake to half a bottle of wine each night\" and no other symptoms, so mild AUD possible.\n\nSo, final list:\n1. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent episode, severe with melancholic features - F33.2\n2. Alcohol Use Disorder, mild - F10.10\n3. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood - F43.21\n4. Prolonged Grief Disorder - F43.81 (considering severity, though duration may be insufficient)\n5. Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder - F43.8 (for acute grief reaction)\n\nBut need to choose one between 4 and 5. Since Prolonged Grief Disorder requires 12 months, it's not appropriate. So, better to use Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder for significant grief symptoms not meeting full criteria.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, structured list:\n1. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent episode, severe with melancholic features - F33.2\n2. Alcohol Use Disorder, mild - F10.10\n3. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood - F43.21\n4. Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder (Acute Grief Reaction) - F43.8\n5. Unspecified Depressive Disorder? No, MDD is already there. Maybe Persistent Complex Bereavement Disorder? But that's same as Prolonged Grief. Hmm.\n\nPerhaps Rule Out Bipolar Disorder? No history of mania. So, maybe only 4 diagnoses. But instruction says top 5, so include all likely, even if some are rule-outs.\n\nGiven his history, recurrent MDD is primary. Secondary: AUD, Adjustment Disorder, Acute Stress Reaction? But not acute stress symptoms. So, maybe Generalized Anxiety Disorder? Not mentioned. So, stick to above.\n\nI think that covers it.",

During that time, she reported depression every day for most of the day. Symptoms had been worsening for months. She had lost 9 lb (current weight 105 lb) without dieting because she did not feel like eating. She had trouble falling asleep almost every night and woke at 3:00 a.m. several mornings per week (she normally woke at 6:30 a.m.). She had diminished energy, concentration, and ability to perform her administrative job at a dog food processing plant.

    "vignette":"Crystal Smith, a 33-year-old African American homemaker, came to an outpatient clinic seeking \u201csomeone to talk to\u201d about feelings of despair that had intensified over the previous 8\u201310 months. She was particularly upset about marital conflict and an uncharacteristic irritability with her mother-in-law.\n\nMs. Smith said she had begun to wake before dawn, feeling down and tearful. She had difficulty getting out of bed and completing her usual household activities. At times, she felt guilty for not being her \u201cusual self.\u201d At other times, she became easily irritated with her husband and impatient with her mother-in-law for minor transgressions. She relied on her mother-in-law for assistance with her children, but recently her mother-in-law appeared to be less available. Ms. Smith worries that she has become a burden to her mother-in-law. Her related guilt, in combination with her insomnia and fatigue, have made it very difficult for Ms. Smith to get her children to school on time. In the past few months, she had lost 13 pounds without dieting. She denied current suicidal ideation, saying she \u201cwould never do something like that,\u201d but acknowledged having thought that she \u201cshould just give up\u201d and that she \u201cwould be better off dead.\u201d She decided to make an appointment after she attended her good friend\u2019s wedding and found she did not enjoy any of it.\n\nTwo months previously, Ms. Smith had seen a psychiatrist for several weeks and received fluoxetine. She reluctantly gave it a try, discontinuing it quickly because it made her feel even more tired. She had also dropped out of therapy, indicating that the psychiatrist did not seem to understand her.\n\nMs. Smith lived with her husband of 13 years and two school-age children. Her husband\u2019s parents lived next door. She said her marriage was good, although her husband suggested she \u201cgo see someone\u201d so that she would not be \u201cpacing and yelling at everyone all the time.\u201d While historically sociable, she now rarely talked to her own mother and sisters, much less her friends. Previously a regular churchgoer, she had quit attending because she felt her faith was \u201cweak.\u201d Her pastor had always been supportive, but she had not contacted him with her problems because \u201che wouldn\u2019t want to hear about these kinds of issues.\u201d\n\nMs. Smith described herself as having been an outgoing, friendly child. She grew up with her parents and three siblings. She recalled feeling quite upset at age 10\u201311 when her parents divorced and her mom remarried. Because of fights with other kids at school, she met with a school counselor with whom she felt a bond. Unlike the psychiatrist she had recently consulted, Ms. Smith felt the counselor did not \u201cget into my business\u201d and helped her recover. She said she became quieter as she entered junior high school, with fewer friends and little interest in studying. She married her husband at age 20 and worked in retail sales until the birth of their first child when she was 23 years old.\n\nMs. Smith had not used alcohol since her first pregnancy, and she denied any use of illicit substances. She also denied past and current use of prescribed medications, other than the brief trial of the antidepressant medication. She reported generally good health.\n\nOn mental status examination, Ms. Smith was a casually groomed young woman who was coherent and goal directed. She had difficulty making eye contact with the white middle-aged therapist. She was cooperative but mildly guarded and slow to respond. She needed encouragement to elaborate her thinking. She was periodically tearful and generally appeared sad. She denied confusion, psychosis, hallucinations, current suicidal ideation, and homicidality.

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, the user has provided a clinical case vignette and asked me to diagnose it following specific guidelines. Let me start by carefully extracting the key information from the vignette.\n\nFirst, the patient is Crystal Smith, a 33-year-old African American homemaker. She reports feelings of despair over the past 8-10 months, with symptoms including early morning awakening, anhedonia (not enjoying her friend's wedding), weight loss without dieting, guilt, irritability, and passive suicidal thoughts. She also has fatigue and difficulty completing daily activities. \n\nHmm, she had a previous trial of fluoxetine which worsened her fatigue, leading to discontinuation. There's marital conflict and withdrawal from social activities, including church. Past history includes parental divorce during childhood, school counseling, and becoming quieter in junior high. Mental status exam shows depressed mood, tearfulness, but no psychosis or cognitive issues.\n\nNow, organizing this data: The core symptoms align with a major depressive episode\u2014depressed mood, anhedonia, weight loss, insomnia (especially early morning awakening), fatigue, guilt, and suicidal ideation. That's at least five symptoms for over two weeks, so Major Depressive Disorder is the primary consideration. \n\nBut wait, there's also significant irritability and marital conflict. Could there be a bipolar component? She doesn't mention manic episodes, so Bipolar Disorder is less likely, but it's worth considering in the differential. \n\nAnxiety symptoms? She worries about being a burden, but no explicit anxiety disorders are highlighted. However, adjustment disorder with depressed mood is possible given the marital and family stressors. \n\nPersonality disorders? She has interpersonal difficulties but no clear pattern of longstanding personality pathology. Maybe avoidant traits due to her guardedness and withdrawal, but not enough for a full diagnosis. \n\nWhat about persistent depressive disorder? The symptoms have been present for 8-10 months, which is less than two years, so major depression is more fitting. Also, the school issues in junior high might suggest a previous depressive episode, but it's not clearly documented. \n\nCultural factors: She's African American, and there's mention of difficulty with a white therapist, which might affect rapport but doesn't change the diagnosis. \n\nRule-outs: No substance use, good physical health, no psychosis. So, medical or substance-induced causes are less likely. \n\nSecondary diagnoses: Adjustment disorder given the stressor of marital conflict and mother-in-law issues. Other specified depressive disorder if some criteria aren't fully met, but MDD seems solid. Maybe dysthymia if the childhood issues were chronic, but the current episode is acute. \n\nFinalizing the list: Primary is Major Depressive Disorder. Secondary could be Adjustment Disorder, Other Specified Depressive Disorder, and considering cultural factors maybe V-code for relational problems. But the user asked for top 5 psychiatric diagnoses with F-codes. Let me check ICD-10 codes: F32.9 for MDD, F43.21 for adjustment disorder with depressed mood, F34.1 for dysthymia if applicable, F41.9 for unspecified anxiety if needed, but anxiety isn't prominent. Maybe recurrent MDD if considering past episodes, but the vignette doesn't specify recurrence. \n\nWait, she had symptoms in junior high\u2014could that be a past episode? It's vague, so maybe specify MDD, single or recurrent. Since it's not clear, using F32.9 is safe. Alternatively, F33.9 for recurrent. But the current episode is the focus, so F32.9. \n\nOther differentials: Bereavement? No. PTSD? No trauma mentioned. OCD? No. So, sticking with depressive disorders and adjustment. \n\nLet me structure the output: Primary: Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, moderate? She has several symptoms but functional impairment is present (kids late to school), so moderate. Code F32.1 for moderate, or F32.9 if unspecified. The vignette doesn't specify severity, so F32.9. \n\nSecondary: Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood (F43.21), Persistent Depressive Disorder (dysthymia) if considering chronic low mood, but the current episode is more acute. Maybe Other Specified Depressive Disorder (F32.8) for atypical features like irritability? But irritability is part of MDD criteria. \n\nMaybe include relational problems (Z codes) but those aren't F-codes. The user said only psychiatric diagnoses with F-codes. So avoid Z codes. \n\nAnxiety disorder NOS (F41.9) as she has worries, but not enough for GAD. Possibly Unspecified Mood Disorder (F39) if uncertain, but MDD is clear. \n\nTop 5: MDD, Adjustment Disorder, Persistent Depressive Disorder, Other Specified Depressive Disorder, Unspecified Anxiety Disorder. But need to prioritize likelihood. MDD first, then Adjustment, then Dysthymia, then Other Depressive, then Anxiety NOS. \n\nCheck ICD-10 codes: F32.9, F43.21, F34.1, F32.8, F41.9. Yes, that seems reasonable. \n\nWait, could there be a personality disorder? Maybe avoidant personality traits, but not diagnosed here. So skip that. \n\nAlso, she had a negative reaction to fluoxetine\u2014maybe indicates bipolar depression? But no manic symptoms. So Bipolar II is possible but less likely. Include in differential but not top 5. The user asked for top 5, so stick with the most evident. \n\nFinal list: 1. Major Depressive Disorder - F32.9, 2. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood - F43.21, 3. Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) - F34.1, 4. Other Specified Depressive Disorder - F32.8, 5. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder - F41.9. \n\nBut let's double-check if dysthymia is appropriate. The symptoms started 8-10 months ago, not two years, so maybe not. Replace with Unspecified Mood Disorder (F39). Or Bipolar II? Not enough evidence. \n\nAdjustment disorder is likely due to marital stress. Other specified depressive could be for mixed features? Irritability is present. Unspecified anxiety as she has excessive worry. \n\nAlternatively, consider Bereavement? No. PTSD? No. So those aren't relevant. \n\nI think the list is set. Just output without reasoning as per instructions.",

Her supervisor had referred Ms. Taylor to the EAP after she had become tearful while being mildly criticized during an otherwise positive annual performance review. Somewhat embarrassed, she told the consulting psychiatrist that she had been \u201cfeeling low for years\u201d and that hearing criticism of her work had been \u201cjust too much.\u201d\n\nA native of western Canada, Ms. Taylor came to the United States to pursue graduate studies in chemistry. She left graduate school before completing her doctorate and began work as a laboratory technician. She reported feeling frustrated with her job, which she saw as a \u201cdead end,\u201d yet feared that she lacked the talent to find more satisfying work. As a result, she struggled with guilty feelings that she \u201chadn\u2019t done much\u201d with her life.\n\nDespite her troubles at work, Ms. Taylor felt that she could concentrate without difficulty. She denied ever having active suicidal thoughts, yet sometimes wondered, \u201cWhat is the point of life?\u201d When asked, she reported that she occasionally had trouble falling asleep. However, she denied any change in her weight or appetite. Although she occasionally would go out with coworkers, she said that she felt shy and awkward in social situations unless she knew the people well. She did enjoy jogging and the outdoors. Although her romantic relationships tended to \u201cnot last long,\u201d she felt that her sex drive was normal. She noted that her symptoms waxed and waned but had remained consistent over the past 3 years. She had no symptoms suggestive of mania or hypomania.\n\nMs. Taylor was an only child. Growing up, she had a close relationship with her father, a pharmacist who owned a drugstore. She described him as a \u201cnormal guy who liked to hunt and fish\u201d and liked to take her hiking. Her mother, a nurse, stopped working shortly after giving birth and had seemed emotionally distant and depressed.\n\nMs. Taylor became depressed for the first time in high school when her father was repeatedly hospitalized after developing leukemia. At that time she was treated with psychotherapy and responded well. She had no other psychiatric or medical history, and her medications were a multivitamin and oral contraceptives. When offered several different treatments, she expressed a preference for a combination of medication and psychotherapy. She started taking citalopram and began a course of supportive psychotherapy. After several months of treatment, she revealed that she had been sexually abused by a family friend during her childhood.

She had yelled at him and then, out of the blue, ended the relationship. She felt despondent afterward, guilty and self-critical. When she called him to make up, he had refused, saying he was tired of her \u201cPMS [premenstrual syndrome] explosions.\u201d She had then cut herself superficially on her left forearm, which she had found to be a reliable method to reduce anxiety since she was a young teenager.\n\nShe said these mood swings came out of the blue every month and that they featured tension, argumentativeness, anxiety, sadness, and regret. Sometimes she yelled at her boyfriend, but she also got upset with friends, work, and her family. During the week in which she was \u201cMr. Hyde,\u201d she avoided socializing or talking on the phone; she wouldn\u2019t be her \u201cusual fun self,\u201d she said, and would alienate her friends.

Her family history was pertinent for a mother with possible depression. Ms. Wang was born in Taiwan and came to the United States at age 14 to attend boarding school. After graduating from an elite business school, she had moved in with her older sister.\n\nOn mental status examination, Ms. Wang was a fashionably dressed East Asian woman wearing tasteful jewelry and carrying a designer bag. Her hair was slightly askew. She maintained good eye contact and was pleasant and cooperative throughout the interview. Her speech was normal in rate, rhythm, and volume. She described her mood as \u201cgenerally good,\u201d and her affect was full, reactive, and mildly irritable.

    "model_thoughts":"Hmm, this is a detailed clinical vignette requiring a structured diagnostic list based on DSM-5-TR criteria. The user emphasized following a clinical reasoning rubric but explicitly asked not to output any reasoning\u2014just the top five diagnoses with ICD-10 codes. \n\nThe vignette clearly describes cyclical mood symptoms tied to the menstrual cycle, with key features like irritability, anxiety, sadness, interpersonal conflicts, and self-harm (cutting) during the luteal phase, followed by resolution after menses. The patient also mentions longstanding use of self-harm to reduce anxiety since adolescence. \n\nThe primary diagnosis seems straightforward: Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD), given the cyclical pattern, functional impairment, and absence of other mood episodes outside the peri-menstrual window. The cutting behavior points to a separate, co-occurring condition\u2014likely Non-Suicidal Self-Injury as a provisional diagnosis since it\u2019s not a formal DSM-5 disorder but fits under \"Other Specified\" for coding. \n\nFor differentials, Persistent Depressive Disorder should be considered due to chronic low mood and self-criticism, though the cyclical pattern leans away from it. Generalized Anxiety Disorder is plausible given tension and anxiety, but again, the peri-menstrual clustering is more prominent. Borderline Personality Disorder traits are hinted at (mood swings, self-harm, interpersonal strife), but the cyclical nature and intact baseline functioning argue against a full diagnosis. \n\nThe user specified no clinical reasoning in the response, so I\u2019ll stick strictly to the format: primary diagnosis first, then four secondaries ordered by likelihood.

He had frequent thoughts of wanting to be dead and of suicide, but he denied any suicidal intent or plans.\n\nWhen asked about the alcohol, he acknowledged that he had been drinking heavily for at least 6 months. When asked about other substances, he asked about therapeutic confidentiality and then acknowledged that he had been using cocaine several times per week for about 9 months. He kept his cocaine use from his wife because he knew she would be judgmental. In the beginning, cocaine put him in a reliably positive, optimistic mood, and he found that he could more successfully churn through large volumes of otherwise tedious and discouraging work. Although his work required some socializing in the evening, he also began to regularly go to bars in the evening just so that he would have a place to comfortably combine cocaine with alcohol. He craved the high from cocaine, went out of his way to obtain it, and spent a lot of time getting high that he would previously have been spending with his family.\n\nWhen asked to clarify the sequence of work stress, cocaine use, and depression symptoms, he reported that he had felt worried and discouraged about work for a year, but the feelings of depression, loss of interest, irritability, insomnia, and low self-esteem had not begun until about 6 months earlier, 3 months after he had begun to use cocaine regularly. He experienced those depressive symptoms most of the day every day, whether or not he had taken cocaine within the last several days.\n\nMr. Young denied any previous episodes of depression, other mood or anxiety disorders, or suicide attempts. He drank socially. He had experimented with cannabis and cocaine as a teenager but had never developed a pattern of regular use or impairment until the past year.",

    "vignette":"George Anderson, a 73-year-old married man, was referred to a psychiatrist for an evaluation of depression after screening positive on the Geriatric Depression Scale during a neurology appointment. For most of the 2 years since his diagnosis with Parkinson\u2019s disease, Mr. Anderson had coped well and continued to engage in many of his usual activities. His wife of 49 years noted that 1\u20132 years before developing Parkinson\u2019s disease, Mr. Anderson had become somewhat less enthusiastic and motivated compared with his baseline personality, but not to the point of causing any concern or impairment. The only other neuropsychiatric symptom preceding his Parkinson\u2019s diagnosis was his wife\u2019s report that during the past 5 years he frequently \u201cthrashed about\u201d while asleep.\n\nThree months prior to the referral, however, Mr. Anderson began to decline social invitations from family and friends. He reported that he had withdrawn socially because he had lost pleasure in things that used to excite him, although he denied persistent feelings of sadness or worry. He recognized that he was not his \u201cusual self\u201d and tried, to no avail, to give himself \u201cpep talks.\u201d He had worked as a high school science teacher until retirement at age 67, and reported having learned \u201cthe power of seeing the glass half full\u201d from his students. He felt frustrated that he could not \u201csnap out of it\u201d for the first time in his life but was hopeful about getting professional help. He denied wishing for death, explaining that although he was not afraid of death, he wanted to enjoy life as long as possible. He added, \u201cGod does not give me more than I can handle. I can\u2019t ask for a better family, and I have had a full life.\u201d\n\nOther new symptoms over the prior few months included increasing fatigue, impaired concentration and memory, unintentional weight loss, and sleep-onset insomnia. Further history on his more chronic sleep symptoms revealed that, around 3:00 a.m. or 4:00 a.m. on most nights, Mr. Anderson began violently moving his extremities and moaning as though in distress, all while still seemingly asleep in bed. He often awakened his wife with these movements and occasionally struck her in his sleep. She sometimes used a different bedroom because of this. When he awoke from such an incident, he was coherent and briefly anxious, often reporting that he had been dreaming of swimming or running from something.\n\nHis wife took over driving shortly after his Parkinson\u2019s disease diagnosis, but Mr. Anderson was otherwise independent in activities of daily living such as paying bills and managing his medications. His wife described him as \u201cmaybe a little more forgetful\u201d over the past few years, but neither of them was concerned about this mild memory loss.\n\nPast medical history included prostate cancer (in remission), glaucoma, and gout. Labs from his recent neurology visit were unremarkable, including blood counts, serum chemistries, thyroid function, and vitamin B12 levels. Family psychiatric history was positive only for a granddaughter with ADHD. He denied past problematic substance use and all current substance use except two or three glasses of wine monthly. He denied any previous depressive episodes, psychiatric treatment, or psychiatric evaluations.\n\nOn mental status examination, Mr. Anderson was pleasant, cooperative, and interpersonally engaging. Resting tremor, shuffling gait, hypophonia, and bradykinesia all were evident at mild to moderate levels. He occasionally smiled, but his affect was difficult to fully gauge because of masked facies. He reported his mood as \u201cblah.\u201d There was no evidence of psychosis.\n\nOn cognitive testing, he had some difficulty on the Trail Making Test part B, figure copying, and word-list recall, the latter being helped by category prompts. On a standardized brief cognitive assessment, he scored 25 out of 30 points, which was in the normal range.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let's start by carefully reading the clinical vignette about George Anderson. He's a 73-year-old man with Parkinson's disease, referred for depression evaluation. The key timeline here is important: symptoms started before the Parkinson's diagnosis, with reduced enthusiasm and motivation about 1-2 years prior, and sleep issues for the past 5 years. Then, three months ago, he developed social withdrawal, anhedonia, fatigue, concentration problems, weight loss, and insomnia.\n\nHmm, the sleep disturbances are notable\u2014violent movements during REM sleep, which sounds like REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). That's often linked to alpha-synucleinopathies like Parkinson's. Since Parkinson's is already diagnosed, the RBD might be part of that spectrum. But the recent depressive symptoms are prominent too.\n\nThe patient denies sadness but has anhedonia and loss of pleasure, which are core depressive symptoms. His affect is masked due to Parkinson's, but he reports his mood as \"blah.\" The cognitive testing shows some mild deficits but within normal range. No psychosis or suicidal ideation.\n\nConsidering the context of Parkinson's disease, the depressive symptoms could be part of a major depressive episode, but the neuropsychiatric features complicate things. The presence of RBD and mild cognitive issues might point toward a neurocognitive disorder related to Parkinson's. However, the cognitive score is still normal, so maybe mild cognitive impairment rather than dementia.\n\nDifferential diagnosis needs to account for both the depressive symptoms and the underlying neurological condition. Major depressive disorder is a strong candidate, but it could be depression due to another medical condition (Parkinson's). Also, the sleep disorder is clearly REM sleep behavior disorder, which is often comorbid with Parkinson's.\n\nThe patient's lack of prior psychiatric history and the onset of symptoms in the context of a neurodegenerative disease suggest that the depression might be secondary to Parkinson's. But the anhedonia and social withdrawal are significant enough to consider a primary depressive disorder as well. Additionally, the mild cognitive impairment might be part of Parkinson's disease neurocognitive disorder.\n\nPutting it all together, the primary diagnosis is likely major depressive disorder, given the anhedonia and other depressive symptoms. Secondary diagnoses would include REM sleep behavior disorder, mild neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson's, and adjustment disorder if the symptoms are a reaction to the illness. But since the symptoms are causing significant distress and impairment, major depressive disorder seems the most fitting as the primary issue.\n\nWait, the rubric emphasizes accurate data extraction and sophisticated diagnostic reasoning. I need to ensure I'm not missing subtle cues. The patient's positive outlook despite symptoms (\"God does not give me more than I can handle\") might indicate resilience, but the functional impairment is clear. The sleep disturbances are severe and predate other symptoms, linking to the Parkinson's diagnosis.\n\nSo, the top five diagnoses would be: major depressive disorder as primary, then REM sleep behavior disorder, mild neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson's, depressive disorder due to another medical condition (Parkinson's), and maybe adjustment disorder with depressed mood. But since major depressive disorder is explicitly mentioned in the vignette as the referral reason, and the symptoms meet criteria, that should be primary. The others are comorbid conditions related to Parkinson's disease.",

    "vignette":"Helena Bates was a 27-year-old single administrative assistant who presented for a psychiatric evaluation and treatment for depression. She had recently begun an intensive outpatient program after a first lifetime hospitalization for an impulsive overdose following the breakup of a 2-year relationship. She said she had been feeling increasingly sad and hopeless for 1\u20132 months prior to the breakup. About a month before her admission, she began seeing a new psychotherapist who told her she had \u201cborderline traits\u201d and \u201csituational mood swings.\u201d\n\nDuring these 4\u20138 weeks, Ms. Bates\u2019s mood had been moderately depressed throughout the day most days, with no diurnal variation and intact mood reactivity. She had recently gained about 10 pounds from \u201covereating comfort food and junk.\u201d She denied prominent irritability or argumentativeness. She described her self-esteem as \u201cnone\u201d and had found it hard to feel motivation or to concentrate on routine tasks. By contrast, sometimes she would have \u201cbursts\u201d of nonstop thinking about her estranged boyfriend and devising ways to \u201cget him back,\u201d alternating with \u201cgrieving his loss.\u201d She described times of being flooded with strategies to regain his interest (including purchasing a full-page newspaper \u201copen letter\u201d to him) and recently found herself awake until 5:00 or 6:00 a.m. journaling or calling friends in the middle of the night \u201cfor support.\u201d She would then \u201ctrudge through the day\u201d without fatigue after only 2\u20133 hours of sleep. These symptoms began prior to her hospitalization. She denied drug or alcohol misuse and self-injurious behavior. Until this particular breakup, she denied a history of particularly intense or chaotic relationships, as well as a history of suicidal thoughts or gestures. Indeed, Ms. Bates seemed horrified by her own impulsive overdose.\n\nPreviously, Ms. Bates had seen a counselor in high school for \u201cmoodiness\u201d and poor grades. She became \u201cdepressed\u201d in college. At that time, she began escitalopram and psychotherapy, but improved quickly and stopped both after a few weeks. While in the hospital following her suicide attempt, she started taking vilazodone and quetiapine at bedtime \u201cfor sleep.\u201d\n\nMs. Bates was the youngest of three children who grew up in a middle-class suburban home. She attended public school and a state college as \u201cmostly a B student\u201d and hoped to someday go to law school. She described herself as having been a \u201cquiet, anxious\u201d child and \u201cnot a troublemaker.\u201d Her older brother abused multiple substances, although Ms. Bates said she herself had never used illicit substances. Her older sister was treated for \u201cpanic attacks and depression,\u201d and Ms. Bates knew of several aunts and cousins whom she thought were \u201cdepressed.\u201d\n\nOn examination, Ms. Bates was a pleasant, well-related, casually but appropriately dressed, moderately overweight woman, appearing her stated age, who made good eye contact. Her speech was somewhat rapid and verbose but interruptible and nonpressured. She had no abnormal motor movements, but she gestured dramatically and with excessive animation. Her mood was depressed, and her affect was tense and dysphoric but with full range and normal responsivity. Ms. Bates\u2019s thought processes were somewhat circumstantial but generally coherent, linear, and logical. Her thought content was notable for passive thoughts that she might be better off dead, but without intent or plan; she had no delusions, hallucinations, or homicidal thoughts. Her higher integrative functioning was grossly intact, as were her insight and judgment.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let's break down the user's query and the clinical vignette provided. First, the user is an expert psychiatrist needing to diagnose based on DSM-5-TR criteria. The response should only list diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes, no reasoning. \n\nStarting with the primary diagnosis. Helena has depressive symptoms but also periods of increased energy and activity. She mentions \"bursts\" of nonstop thinking, reduced need for sleep (2-3 hours without fatigue), and impulsive actions like buying a newspaper ad. These are hypomanic episodes. With a history of past depressive episodes (college), this fits Bipolar II Disorder. The lack of full mania rules out Bipolar I. So F31.81 is appropriate.\n\nNext, she has borderline traits mentioned by her therapist. The impulsive overdose post-breakup, intense efforts to avoid abandonment (newspaper ad), and identity disturbance (self-esteem \"none\") align with Borderline Personality Disorder. That's F60.3.\n\nShe also reports long-standing anxiety since childhood, being a \"quiet, anxious\" child. This suggests a generalized anxiety pattern, but GAD requires 6 months of excessive worry. Her current presentation is more mood-focused, but persistent anxiety warrants F41.1 as a secondary diagnosis.\n\nAdjustment Disorder is considered due to the breakup triggering symptoms, but the presence of hypomanic episodes suggests a mood disorder rather than just an adjustment reaction. However, given the acute stressor and mixed emotional features, F43.23 fits as a rule-out.\n\nPast depressive episodes in college that responded quickly to escitalopram might indicate Major Depressive Disorder, but the current hypomanic symptoms elevate it to bipolar spectrum. Still, MDD recurrent mild is worth including as a differential, hence F33.0.\n\nNeed to ensure non-psychiatric diagnoses are excluded. All listed are F-codes.

    "vignette":"Ian Campbell was a 32-year-old architect who presented for psychiatric consultation because he was floundering at work. His boss had expressed concern after he failed to make progress on a simple project. When Mr. Campbell explained that he had been distracted by problems at home, his boss suggested that more seemed wrong. Mr. Campbell called his internist, who sent him to a neurologist, who referred him for psychiatric evaluation.\n\nMr. Campbell had encountered this problem, difficulty concentrating, before. In college, after his father died of a chronic illness, Mr. Campbell had been unable to study and had taken time off. Twice at his prior job, he experienced episodes lasting months in which he had difficulty making decisions. One of these intervals followed a romantic setback.\n\nThe patient\u2019s mother and sister had been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and treated successfully with medication. A maternal uncle had committed suicide.\n\nThe current impairment\u2019s onset accompanied the breakdown of Mr. Campbell\u2019s marriage of 6 years. Two months earlier, his wife had filed for divorce, announcing that she would live in the distant city her work had taken her to. Mr. Campbell had expected to feel relief; he said his wife had been hostile throughout the marriage. He had begun to entertain fond thoughts of a coworker. Nevertheless, he felt \u201cflat\u201d\u2014unable to imagine a future.\n\nCloser questioning revealed that Mr. Campbell\u2019s problems went beyond impaired cognition. He described apathy and diminished energy. Jazz was a passion, but he no longer attended recitals\u2014although impaired concentration probably played a role as well. Listening, the psychiatrist noted probable retardation of speech. Mr. Campbell said that his employer had mentioned that he was \u201cmoving in slow motion.\u201d The problems were worse in the mornings. In the evenings, Mr. Campbell noticed a spark of energy. He put on music and reviewed reports that he had ignored during the workday.\n\nMr. Campbell declined to characterize himself as sad. He was pleased that the marriage was ending. But the psychiatrist was struck by her own affect in Mr. Campbell\u2019s presence; she felt glum, pessimistic, even weepy.\n\nShe questioned Mr. Campbell at length about depressed mood, changed sleep and appetite, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, and thoughts of death. None of these attributions, he said, applied. Nor had he had indicators of disorders that can be confused with depression. Between episodes of impairment, he felt and functioned well.\n\nThe psychiatrist decided that the problem at hand was close enough to depression to warrant treatment. Factors that influenced her decision included the partial syndromal presentation, diurnal variation, periodic recurrence, lack of future orientation, and her own empathic experience. She proposed psychotherapy centered on Mr. Campbell\u2019s decompensation in the face of loss. He insisted that he did not see the impending divorce in that light. The two agreed on brief psychotherapy supplemented by antidepressants. Within weeks, Mr. Campbell was functioning at full capacity. During the treatment, the psychiatrist was unable to elicit evidence of depressive symptoms beyond those noted in the initial history. All the same, she was convinced that the impaired concentration was a sign and symptom of something very much like major depressive disorder.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, the user provided a clinical case vignette and asked for a structured list of DSM-5-TR diagnoses with ICD-10 codes. I need to follow the rubric closely, aiming for Level 5 in both data extraction and diagnostic reasoning. Let me start by carefully extracting all relevant information from the vignette.\n\nThe patient is a 32-year-old architect with work difficulties due to poor concentration. He has a history of similar episodes after stressful events like his father's death and romantic setbacks. Family history includes major depressive disorder and suicide. The current episode started after his wife filed for divorce. Key symptoms: apathy, low energy, anhedonia (stopped enjoying jazz), psychomotor retardation (slow speech and movement), diurnal variation (worse mornings, better evenings), and impaired concentration. Notably, he denies depressed mood, changes in sleep\/appetite, guilt, or suicidal thoughts. The psychiatrist notes her own empathic response feeling glum. Treatment with antidepressants and therapy led to full recovery.\n\nNow, organizing this data: Recurrent episodes of impairment tied to stressors, core depressive symptoms without full syndromal criteria, positive family history, good inter-episode functioning, and treatment response. The challenge is he doesn't meet full criteria for major depressive disorder due to missing symptoms like depressed mood or anhedonia, but the pattern strongly suggests a depressive condition.\n\nFor differential diagnosis: The primary issue is recurrent depressive episodes with atypical features. Considering other possibilities: adjustment disorder given the stressor, but episodes last months and recur, which fits dysthymia less due to episodic nature. Persistent depressive disorder might not fit because he has well periods. Could it be other specified depressive disorder? Since it's subthreshold but recurrent and treatment-responsive, that seems likely. Also rule out bipolar or anxiety, but no manic or anxiety symptoms noted. The vignette emphasizes it's \"something very much like major depressive disorder\" but not full criteria.\n\nSo, prioritizing: Other specified depressive disorder as primary since it captures recurrent subthreshold episodes. Then major depressive disorder in partial remission or recurrent mild? But he never had full criteria. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood is possible but episodes are more severe and recurrent. Dysthymia doesn't fit due to episodic nature. Maybe unspecified depressive disorder as an alternative. Also, considering the psychiatrist's empathic response, maybe there's an element of persistent depressive disorder, but again, not chronic enough.\n\nFinal list should reflect the most likely based on DSM-5-TR. The vignette ends with the psychiatrist convinced it's like MDD but without full symptoms, so other specified depressive disorder fits best. Secondary diagnoses could include adjustment disorder, major depressive disorder (if considering partial presentation), persistent depressive disorder (though less likely), and maybe no other clear ones. Wait, rule out bipolar or anxiety, but not indicated. So top five: Other specified depressive disorder, adjustment disorder, major depressive disorder (recurrent, mild), persistent depressive disorder, and perhaps unspecified depressive disorder if needed. But must rank by likelihood.\n\nLet me double-check ICD-10 codes: F32.8 for other specified depressive episodes, F43.21 for adjustment disorder with depressed mood, F32.0 for mild depressive episode (if considering MDD), F34.1 for persistent depressive disorder, and F32.9 for unspecified depressive episode. But the vignette says he doesn't meet full criteria for MDD, so F32.8 is more accurate as primary. The others are differentials.",

    "vignette":"Logan was a 12-year-old boy who was referred to mental health care for long-standing anxiety about losing his parents and relatively recent fears about getting a severe disease.\n\nAlthough his parents described a long history of anxiety, Logan\u2019s acute problem began 5 weeks prior to the consultation, when he watched a television show about rare and fatal diseases. Afterward, he became scared that he might have a hidden disease. His parents reported three \u201cpanic attacks\u201d in the prior month, marked by anxiety, dizziness, sweats, and shortness of breath. About that same time, Logan began to complain of frequent headaches and stomachaches. Logan\u2019s own theory was that his bodily aches were caused by his fears about being ill and about his parents going away, but the pain was still uncomfortable. He insisted he was not scared about having more panic attacks but was petrified about being left sick and alone. These illness fears developed several times a week, usually when Logan was in bed, when he \u201cfelt something\u201d in his body, or when he heard about diseases.\n\nLogan had begun to suffer from anxieties as a young child. Kindergarten was notable for intense separation difficulties. He was briefly bullied in third grade, which led to his first panic attacks and worsening anxiety. According to his parents, \u201cthere always seemed to be a new anxiety.\u201d These included fear of the toilet, the dark, sleeping alone, being alone, and being pestered.\n\nLogan\u2019s most persistent fear revolved around his parents\u2019 safety. He was generally fine when both were at work or at home, but when they were in transit, or anywhere else, he was generally afraid that they would die in an accident. When the parents were late from work or when they tried to go out together or on an errand without him, Logan became frantic, calling and texting incessantly. Logan was predominantly concerned about his mother\u2019s safety, and she had gradually reduced her solo activities to a minimum. As she said, it felt like \u201che would like to follow me into the toilet.\u201d Logan was less demanding toward his father, who believed his wife had been too soft and overprotective.\n\nLogan and his family underwent several months of psychotherapy when Logan was age 10. The father said therapy helped his wife become less overprotective, and Logan\u2019s anxiety seemed to improve. Logan\u2019s mother agreed with this assessment, although she said she was not sure what she was supposed to do when her son was panicking whenever she tried to leave the house or whenever he worried about getting a disease.\n\nLogan\u2019s developmental history was otherwise unremarkable. His grades were generally good. His teachers agreed that he was quiet but had several friends and collaborated well with other children. He was quick, however, to negatively interpret the intentions of other children. For example, he tended to be very sensitive to any indication that he was being picked on.\n\nLogan\u2019s family history was pertinent for panic disorder, agoraphobia, and social anxiety disorder in the mother. The maternal grandmother was described as \u201cat least as\u201d anxious as Logan\u2019s mother. The father denied psychiatric illness in his family.\n\nOn examination, Logan was a friendly, articulate boy who was cooperative and goal directed. He was generally in a \u201cgood mood\u201d but cried when talking about his fears of dying and getting sick. He denied suicidality and hopelessness but indicated he was desperate to get over his problems before starting high school. His cognition was good. His insight and judgment appeared intact except as related to his anxiety issues.",

The rubric emphasizes sophisticated data extraction and diagnostic reasoning, though the response must exclude clinical reasoning per instructions.\n\nFirst, I need to extract all key clinical details systematically. Logan's presentation has multiple layers: long-standing separation anxiety since kindergarten, recent illness anxiety triggered by a TV show, panic attacks, somatic symptoms (headaches\/stomachaches), and pervasive worry about parents' safety. The developmental timeline shows anxiety traits evolving over years with specific triggers (bullying, media exposure). Family history of anxiety disorders is significant. Mental status exam shows intact cognition but emotional distress focused on health\/separation fears.\n\nFor diagnostic reasoning, the primary issue appears to be separation anxiety disorder given its early onset, persistence, and disproportionate distress about parental separation\/safety. The recent illness fears could be either illness anxiety disorder or somatic symptom disorder given his preoccupation with disease despite normal medical evaluations (implied by absence of medical workup mention). Panic attacks are clearly documented but don't meet full panic disorder criteria since they're situationally bound to health\/separation triggers.\n\nI should also consider generalized anxiety disorder given multiple anxiety foci, but separation anxiety seems more predominant. Social anxiety might be a lesser consideration due to sensitivity to peer interactions, but it's not the core feature. The differential needs to prioritize based on severity and impact - separation anxiety clearly disrupts family functioning most significantly.\n\nThe formatting must strictly follow: primary diagnosis first with F-code, then four secondaries. I'll select F93.0 for separation anxiety, F45.21 for illness anxiety, F41.0 for panic disorder (since attacks occur recurrently), F45.1 for somatic symptom disorder (given bodily aches), and F41.1 for generalized anxiety as a broader underlying tendency.",

    "vignette":"Maria Greco was a 23-year-old single woman who was referred for psychiatric evaluation by her cardiologist. In the prior 2 months, she had presented to the emergency room four times for acute complaints of palpitations, shortness of breath, sweats, trembling, and the fear that she was about to die. Each of these events had a rapid onset. The symptoms peaked within minutes, leaving her scared, exhausted, and fully convinced that she had just experienced a heart attack. Medical evaluations done right after these episodes yielded normal physical exam findings, vital signs, lab results, toxicology screens, and electrocardiograms.\n\nThe patient reported a total of five such attacks in the prior 3 months, with the panic occurring at work, at home, and while driving a car. She had developed a persistent fear of having other attacks, which led her to take many days off work and to avoid exercise, driving, and coffee. Her sleep quality declined, as did her mood. She avoided social relationships. She did not accept the reassurance offered to her by friends and physicians, believing that the medical workups were negative because they were performed after the resolution of the symptoms. She continued to suspect that something was wrong with her heart and that without an accurate diagnosis, she was going to die. When she had a panic attack while asleep in the middle of the night, she finally agreed to see a psychiatrist.\n\nMs. Greco denied a history of previous psychiatric disorders except for a history of anxiety during childhood that had been diagnosed as a \u201cschool phobia.\u201d\n\nThe patient\u2019s mother had committed suicide by overdose 4 years earlier in the context of recurrent major depressive disorder. At the time of the evaluation, the patient was living with her father and two younger siblings. The patient had graduated from high school, was working as a telephone operator, and was not dating anyone. Her family and social histories were otherwise noncontributory.\n\nOn examination, the patient was an anxious-appearing, cooperative, coherent young woman. She denied depression but did appear worried and was preoccupied with ideas of having heart disease. She denied psychotic symptoms, confusion, and all suicidality. Her cognition was intact, insight was limited, and judgment was fair.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, the user wants me to act as an expert psychiatrist and diagnose based on the provided clinical vignette. Let me start by carefully extracting all the key details from the case.\n\nFirst, Maria is 23, with recurrent acute episodes of palpitations, shortness of breath, sweating, trembling, and fear of dying. These attacks peak within minutes, which aligns with panic attacks. She\u2019s had five episodes in three months, occurring in various settings. Medical workups are normal, but she remains convinced of a heart issue. \n\nShe avoids activities like driving, exercise, and caffeine due to fear of future attacks. Sleep and mood have declined, and she\u2019s socially withdrawn. There\u2019s no prior psychiatric history except childhood anxiety labeled as \u201cschool phobia.\u201d Family history includes maternal suicide due to recurrent major depressive disorder.\n\nOn exam, she\u2019s anxious, preoccupied with heart disease, denies depression or psychosis, has limited insight but fair judgment. The symptoms started two months ago with increasing frequency.\n\nPrimary diagnosis seems like Panic Disorder given recurrent unexpected panic attacks and persistent concern about more attacks. Need to check if it\u2019s with or without agoraphobia. She avoids driving and social situations, which might indicate agoraphobia, but she\u2019s still going to work sometimes. Maybe Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia.\n\nSecondary diagnoses: Illness Anxiety Disorder because she\u2019s convinced she has a heart condition despite negative tests. Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood due to stress from panic attacks affecting sleep and mood. Generalized Anxiety Disorder might fit because of persistent worry, but panic is more prominent. Specific Phobia could be considered for her avoidance behaviors, but it\u2019s tied to panic. \n\nLet me list the top five with ICD-10 codes. Panic Disorder as primary, then Illness Anxiety, Adjustment Disorder, GAD, and maybe Other Specified Anxiety Disorder for childhood school phobia if needed. But the vignette says no prior disorders except childhood anxiety, so maybe GAD is less likely. \n\nWait, Agoraphobia is separate in DSM-5. Since she avoids multiple situations, Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia might be correct. But the vignette says she avoids driving, exercise, coffee, and social relationships. That\u2019s more than just panic, so Agoraphobia could be a secondary diagnosis. \n\nLet me structure: 1. Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia. 2. Illness Anxiety Disorder. 3. Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood. 4. Agoraphobia (if not combined with Panic Disorder). But in DSM-5, Panic Disorder can be specified with Agoraphobia. So maybe list Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia as primary, then separate Agoraphobia if needed? Actually, in DSM-5, Agoraphobia is its own diagnosis, but Panic Disorder can have a specifier. I think Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia F40.01. Then Illness Anxiety Disorder F45.21. Adjustment Disorder F43.23. Generalized Anxiety Disorder F41.1. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder F41.8 for childhood history. \n\nBut the user wants top 5 most likely. Let me prioritize based on symptoms. Panic Disorder is clear. Illness Anxiety due to health preoccupation. Adjustment Disorder given the stressor. GAD might be secondary. Specific Phobia isn\u2019t prominent. So final list: Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia, Illness Anxiety, Adjustment Disorder, GAD, and maybe Other Specified Anxiety Disorder for the childhood phobia. \n\nCheck ICD-10 codes: Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia F40.01, Illness Anxiety Disorder F45.21, Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood F43.23, GAD F41.1, Other Specified Anxiety Disorder F41.8. Yes, that seems accurate.",

    "vignette":"Nadine was a 15-year-old girl whose mother brought her for a psychiatric evaluation to help with her long-standing shyness.\n\nAlthough Nadine was initially reluctant to say much about herself, she said she felt constantly tense. She added that the anxiety had been \u201creally bad\u201d for several years and was often accompanied by episodes of dizziness and crying. She was generally unable to speak in any situation outside of her home or school classes. She refused to leave her house alone for fear of being forced to interact with someone. She was especially anxious around other teenagers, but she had also become \u201ctoo nervous\u201d to speak to adult neighbors she had known for years. She said it felt impossible to walk into a restaurant and order from \u201ca stranger at the counter\u201d for fear of being humiliated. She also felt constantly on her guard, needing to avoid the possibility of getting attacked, a strategy that really only worked when she was alone in her home.\n\nNadine tried to conceal her crippling anxiety from her parents, typically telling them that she \u201cjust didn\u2019t feel like\u201d going out. Feeling trapped and incompetent, Nadine said she contemplated suicide \u201call the time.\u201d In the month before her mother finally brought her in for a psychiatric evaluation, Nadine had begun to cut herself on her thighs to \u201cfeel pain and relieve stress.\u201d No one in the family was aware of this development.\n\nNadine had always been \u201cshy\u201d and had been teased at recess since she started kindergarten. The teasing had escalated to outright bullying by the time she was in seventh grade. The bullying took on a cultural\/racially motivated undertone; Nadine and her family were of a different ethnicity than the vast majority of her schoolmates. For 2 years, day after difficult day, Nadine\u2019s peers turned on her \u201clike a snarling wolf pack,\u201d calling her \u201cstupid,\u201d \u201cugly,\u201d and \u201ccrazy.\u201d Not infrequently, one of them would stare at her and tell her she would be better off committing suicide. One girl (the ringleader, as well as a former elementary school chum) hit Nadine on one occasion, giving her a black eye. Nadine did not fight back. This event was witnessed by an adult neighbor, who told Nadine\u2019s mother. When Nadine\u2019s mother asked her about the incident, Nadine denied it, saying she had \u201cfallen\u201d on the street. She did, however, mention to her mother \u201cin passing\u201d that she wanted to switch schools, but her delivery was so offhand that at the time, her mother casually advised against the switch. Nadine suffered on, sobbing herself to sleep most nights and wishing that she would not wake up.\n\nFull of hope and ideas of escape from the bullies and their narrowness, Nadine transferred to a specialty arts high school for ninth grade. Although the bullying ceased, her anxiety symptoms paradoxically worsened. She felt even more unable to venture into public spaces and felt increasingly embarrassed by her inability to develop the sort of independence typical of a 15-year-old. She said she had begun to spend whole weekends \u201ctrapped\u201d in her home and had become scared to even read by herself in the local park. Nadine\u2019s social anxiety had evolved into true agoraphobia. She had nightly nightmares about the bullies in her old school. Her preoccupation with suicide grew.\n\nHer parents had thought she would outgrow being shy and sought psychiatric help for her only after a teacher remarked that her anxiety and social isolation were keeping her from making the sort of grades and doing the sort of extracurricular activities that were necessary to get into a good college.\n\nNadine described her mother as loud, excitable, aggressive, and \u201ca little frightening.\u201d Her father was a successful tax attorney who worked long hours. Nadine described him as shy in social situations (\u201cHe\u2019s more like me\u201d). Nadine said she and her father sometimes joked that the goal of any evening was to avoid tipping the mother into a rage. Nadine added that she \u201cnever wanted to be anything like her mother.\u201d",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the clinical case vignette about Nadine. I need to extract all relevant information systematically. Nadine is a 15-year-old girl with long-standing shyness, but the details point to more severe issues.\n\nFirst, her symptoms: constant tension, anxiety for several years, dizziness, crying. She's unable to speak outside home or school, avoids leaving home alone, fears interaction with others, especially teens and even familiar adults. This sounds like social anxiety, but there's more. She has fear of humiliation, avoids restaurants, feels on guard, and only feels safe alone at home. That seems like agoraphobia too.\n\nShe's hiding her anxiety from parents, contemplates suicide frequently, and has started self-cutting on her thighs to relieve stress. That's a red flag for self-harm and suicidal ideation. The bullying history is intense: teased since kindergarten, escalated to racial\/cultural bullying in seventh grade, physical assault (black eye), and peers telling her to commit suicide. That's severe peer victimization.\n\nEven after transferring to a new school where bullying stopped, her anxiety worsened. She's trapped at home, scared to go to the park, has nightmares about past bullies, and increased suicidal thoughts. Family dynamics: mother described as loud, aggressive, frightening; father shy and avoidant. Nadine fears provoking her mother's rage.\n\nPutting this together, the core issues are severe social anxiety, avoidance behaviors, agoraphobia, suicidal ideation, self-harm, and a history of trauma from bullying. The nightmares and worsening symptoms after the bullying stopped suggest possible PTSD or adjustment issues. The self-cutting and suicidal thoughts indicate a major depressive element or a separate self-harm disorder. The family environment might contribute to anxiety.\n\nNow, considering DSM-5-TR diagnoses:\n1. Social Anxiety Disorder seems primary due to intense fear of social situations, humiliation, avoidance. \n2. Agoraphobia is prominent, but it might be comorbid with social anxiety.\n3. Persistent Depressive Disorder or Major Depressive Disorder given chronic low mood, suicidal ideation, worthlessness.\n4. Post-traumatic Stress Disorder from the bullying trauma, with nightmares, avoidance, negative alterations in mood.\n5. Non-Suicidal Self-Injury as a condition for further study, but since it's not a main DSM category, maybe Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, or specify self-harm separately.\n\nThe ICD-10 codes: Social phobia is F40.1, Agoraphobia F40.00, Major Depressive Disorder F32.9, PTSD F43.1, and Adjustment Disorder F43.2. But need to check if the depressive symptoms are chronic or episodic. The vignette says \"contemplated suicide all the time\" and worsening, so perhaps recurrent depressive episode. Also, the self-cutting might be part of borderline personality traits, but she's 15, so maybe not diagnosed yet. Better to stick with diagnoses that fit the criteria based on provided info.",

He reported that he usually feels fine except when he is confronted with his inability to travel by airplane. His only daughter had delivered a baby in the prior year, and although he desperately wanted to meet his first granddaughter, he felt unable to fly across the Atlantic Ocean to where his daughter lived.\n\nThe patient\u2019s anxiety about flying had begun 3 years earlier when he was on an airplane that landed during an ice storm. He had last flown a year earlier but had cried during both takeoff and landing; he had then found himself unable to return from that trip by airplane and instead took a train from Rome to Amsterdam. He had gone with his wife to an airport one additional time, 1 year prior to the evaluation, to fly to his daughter\u2019s wedding in the United States. Despite having drunk a significant amount of alcohol, Mr. Hendricks felt unable to board the airplane. After that failed effort, he tended to feel intense anxiety when he even considered the possibility of flying. Anxiety about business trips had led him to decline a promotion as well as an external job offer. Mr. Hendricks sees himself as a \u201cfamily man\u201d and feels terrible that he failed to attend his daughter\u2019s wedding and has not yet been able to meet his granddaughter.\n\nAside from guilt and regret related to his inability to fly, Mr. Hendricks denied other symptoms of depression and anxiety. He had increased his alcohol consumption to three glasses of wine nightly in order to \u201cunwind,\u201d but denied any history of alcohol complications or withdrawal symptoms. He also denied a family history of psychiatric problems.\n\nHe denied experiencing anxiety in other situations, indicating that his colleagues saw him as a forceful and successful businessman who could \u201ceasily\u201d deliver speeches in front of hundreds of people. When specifically asked, he reported that as a child, he had been \u201cpetrified\u201d that he might get attacked by a wild animal. This fear had led him to refuse to go on family camping trips or even on long hikes in the country.

The user expects a concise output with only diagnoses and ICD-10 codes, no reasoning. \n\nFirst, I need to extract key clinical data: the patient's primary issue is a specific phobia of flying, triggered by a traumatic landing event and reinforced by avoidance behaviors. There's also childhood history of animal-related fear, but no current impairment from it. The increased alcohol use seems secondary to anxiety management, but no complications or withdrawal noted. No depressive or generalized anxiety symptoms are present.\n\nFor differential diagnosis, the clearest fit is Specific Phobia, Situational Type, given the marked fear and avoidance of flying. The childhood animal fear might suggest another Specific Phobia, but it's not currently distressing or impairing. Alcohol Use Disorder could be considered due to increased consumption, but without complications or dependence, it's mild at most. Adjustment Disorder isn't a strong fit since the distress is specific to flying-related situations. Panic Disorder is ruled out by absence of unexpected panic attacks. Agoraphobia doesn't align since fear isn't about multiple situations where escape might be hard.\n\nThe primary diagnosis should be Specific Phobia, with secondary considerations for historical animal phobia and mild alcohol use. Other possibilities like Panic Disorder or Agoraphobia are less supported by the data. The structured list should reflect this hierarchy without extra commentary.",

She had never before seen a psychiatrist.\n\nMs. Isaac had lived with her longtime boyfriend until 8 months earlier, at which time he had abruptly ended the relationship to date a younger woman. Soon thereafter, Ms. Isaac began to agonize about routine tasks and the possibility of making mistakes at work. She felt uncharacteristically tense and fatigued. She had difficulty focusing. She also started to worry excessively about money and, to economize, she moved into a cheaper apartment in a less desirable neighborhood. She repeatedly sought reassurance from her office mates and her mother. No one seemed able to help, and she worried about being \u201ctoo much of a burden.\u201d\n\nDuring the 3 months prior to the evaluation, Ms. Isaac began to avoid going out at night, fearing that something bad would happen and she would be unable to summon help. More recently, she avoided going out in the daytime as well. She also felt \u201cexposed and vulnerable\u201d walking to the grocery store three blocks away, so she avoided shopping. After describing that she had figured out how to get her food delivered, she added, \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous.

She reported seeing a counselor at age 10, during her parents\u2019 divorce, because \u201cmy mother thought I was too clingy.\u201d She added that she had never liked being alone, having had boyfriends constantly (occasionally overlapping) since age 16.

The timeline shows symptoms escalating over 8 months, with functional impairment in work and daily activities. Subtle cues include her self-description as \"always nervous,\" childhood clinginess, and pattern of avoiding being single\u2014these hint at underlying personality traits or chronic anxiety disorders.\n\nFor diagnostic reasoning, the primary diagnosis seems clear: separation anxiety disorder in adulthood fits the pervasive fear of abandonment, childhood history, and exacerbation after relationship loss.

Generalized anxiety disorder is present but might not capture the relational and avoidance components fully. Dependent personality disorder aligns with her lifelong pattern of reliance on relationships, though it's less acute.

Several weeks earlier, he had been hospitalized with acute alcohol-associated hepatitis and diagnosed with end-stage liver disease. Prednisolone 40 mg\/day was prescribed for treatment of the hepatitis. Prior to that hospitalization, he had been unaware that his alcohol consumption was seriously damaging his health and was shocked to learn that he would eventually require a liver transplant. Upon discharge, he began an addiction treatment program that was mandatory for him to be listed for possible transplantation.\n\nOutpatient psychiatric consultation was requested by the transplant team after the patient\u2019s family expressed concern that he had recently become increasingly irritable and anxious and seemed to be having difficulty coping with the requirements for transplantation. Mr. Jennings\u2019s primary care physician had recently prescribed alprazolam 0.5 mg as needed for his anxiety. This was initially helpful, but after several days his family noticed he seemed more irritable, lethargic, and forgetful.\n\nWhen interviewed, the patient said that he had been tired for months prior to the diagnosis and that the fatigue had hampered his ability to work (his job required making deliveries for a shipping firm). Although the diagnosis had been a shock, he said he had left the hospital feeling \u201cgreat, better than I\u2019d felt in years.\u201d For about a week after discharge, he described having enhanced energy and a sense of well-being, but he then began to feel anxious and restless. He slept poorly, unable to concentrate, and worried constantly about his health, finances, and family. He became less engaged with his family and stopped watching movies, normally his favorite pastime.\n\nHe denied having nightmares, flashbacks, avoidant behaviors, or racing thoughts. He also denied low mood, tearfulness, appetite changes, anhedonia, helplessness, hopelessness, or suicidality. He reported that he had started drinking daily 10 years earlier, stating that he enjoyed the taste of beer and liked socializing with friends after work. He developed tolerance to alcohol, needing to consume six to eight drinks per night to achieve the same effect. He described some withdrawal symptoms in the morning but did not drink during work hours; he underwent random testing due to his job as a truck driver. He did miss some family activities, preferring to drink, and this had been a source of marital conflict. He admitted feeling guilty about his alcohol use and its impact on him and his family. He denied using any alcohol since his hospitalization. He admitted to anger over having to undergo addiction counseling and had argued with the transplant team about this requirement. He denied having been an anxious person and considered himself able to handle most of life\u2019s challenges without being overwhelmed. His family confirmed his description of himself and viewed his recent behavior as uncharacteristic.\n\nOn mental status examination, Mr. Jennings was a thin, jaundiced, tired-appearing man. His gait was normal, but he was fidgety while seated. He maintained eye contact and responded appropriately, although he repeatedly made comments like, \u201cSomething isn\u2019t right\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s not all in my head.\u201d His affect was anxious and irritable, and his speech was terse. He appeared distracted but denied confusion and disorientation. He had no delusions or hallucinations. His thoughts were logical and coherent, without disorganization, and there was no latency to his responses.

He had been struggling with depressive symptoms for years and had tried fluoxetine, citalopram, and supportive psychotherapy, with minor improvement. He worked full-time but engaged in very few activities outside of work.\n\nWhen asked how he felt, Mr. King said that his mood was low, he was unable to enjoy things, and he had insomnia, feelings of hopelessness, low energy, and difficulty concentrating and making decisions. He denied current suicidality but added that a few years earlier, he had taken a full bottle of medication with the intent to kill himself. He reported that he had done this during a time that he was abusing alcohol. He denied current alcohol or illicit substance use.\n\nWhen asked about anxiety, Mr. King said he was worried about contracting diseases such as HIV. Aware of an unusually strong disinfectant smell, the interviewer asked the patient if he had any particular cleaning behaviors related to the HIV concerns. Mr. King paused and clarified that he avoided touching practically anything outside of his home. When further encouraged, Mr. King said that if he even came close to things that he considered potentially contaminated, he had to wash his hands incessantly with household bleach. He described that he felt like \u201csomething was still there\u201d in his hands and he had to wash his hands until it felt that he had finally done it \u201cright.\u201d\n\nOn average, Mr. King washed his hands up to 30 times a day, spending hours on this routine. Physical contact was particularly difficult. Shopping for groceries and taking public transportation were a big problem, and he had almost given up trying to socialize or engage in romantic relationships. These behaviors had only intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic, though a co-worker liked to joke that Mr. King had been cleaning and social distancing for years before it became fashionable.\n\nWhen asked if he had other worries, Mr. King replied that he had intrusive images of hitting someone, fears that he would say things that might be offensive or inaccurate, and concerns about disturbing his neighbors. To counteract the anxiety produced by these images and thoughts, he constantly replayed prior conversations in his mind, kept diaries to record what he said, and often apologized for fear he might have sounded offensive. When he showered, he made sure that the water in the tub only reached a certain level for fear that if he were not attentive, he would flood his neighbors.\n\nMr. King used gloves at work and performed well. He had no medical problems. He spent most of his free time at home. Although he enjoyed the company of others, the fear of having to touch something if he was invited to a meal or to another person\u2019s home was too much for him to handle.\n\nThe examination revealed a casually dressed man who smelled strongly of bleach. He was worried and constricted but cooperative, coherent, and goal directed. He denied hallucinations and other strongly held ideas. He denied a current intention to hurt himself or others. He was cognitively intact. He recognized that his fears and urges were \u201ckinda crazy,\u201d but he felt they were out of his control.",

The response should be only the list in the specified format.\n\nThe vignette describes Samuel King, a 52-year-old man presenting for depression. Key symptoms include:\n\n- Depressive symptoms: low mood, anhedonia, insomnia, hopelessness, low energy, difficulty concentrating, past suicide attempt with intent during alcohol abuse.\n\n- Anxiety-related behaviors: fear of contracting HIV, avoidance of touching things outside home, excessive hand washing with bleach up to 30 times a day, spending hours on this. He feels compelled to wash until it feels \"right,\" which suggests rituals.\n\n- Other worries: intrusive images of hitting someone, fears of saying offensive things, concerns about disturbing neighbors. To counteract anxiety, he replays conversations, keeps diaries, apologizes frequently, and controls water level in tub to avoid flooding.\n\n- Social impairment: avoids socializing, romantic relationships, shopping, public transportation due to fears.\n\n- Insight: recognizes fears and urges are \"kinda crazy\" but feels out of control.\n\n- Work: uses gloves at work and performs well.\n\n- Mental status: worried and constricted but cooperative, coherent, goal-directed. Denies hallucinations and strong delusions. Cognitively intact.\n\nNow, I need to identify DSM-5-TR diagnoses. The primary issue seems to be obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) based on:\n\n- Obsessions: fears of contamination (HIV), intrusive images of harm, fears of offending.\n\n- Compulsions: excessive hand washing, mental rituals (replaying conversations, keeping diaries), avoidance behaviors.\n\n- These cause significant distress and impairment in social and occupational functioning.\n\n- Insight is present but limited.\n\nThe depressive symptoms are also prominent, but they might be secondary to OCD or a comorbid condition.\n\nOther considerations:\n\n- Past suicide attempt during alcohol abuse, but denies current use. So, alcohol use disorder might be in remission or past.\n\n- Anxiety symptoms are tied to OCD, but generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) could be considered.\n\n- Social anxiety might be present due to avoidance, but it's driven by OCD fears.\n\n- Illness anxiety disorder might be considered for HIV fears, but it's part of OCD obsessions.\n\n- Body dysmorphic disorder isn't indicated.\n\n- PTSD isn't mentioned.\n\n- Psychotic disorders are denied.\n\nPrimary diagnosis: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). ICD-10 F-code: F42.9 (Obsessive-compulsive disorder, unspecified). But DSM-5 specifies OCD, and ICD-10 has F42 for OCD. I should use specific codes. Let me recall:\n\n- F40-F48 are neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders.\n\n- OCD is under F42. Common code: F42.2 (Mixed obsessional thoughts and acts) or F42.8 (Other obsessive-compulsive disorders). For simplicity, I'll use F42.9 for unspecified, but I need to be accurate based on symptoms. Since it includes both obsessions and compulsions, F42.2 might be appropriate. However, in lists, often F42.9 is used. I'll check: In DSM-5-TR, OCD is coded as F42.2 if both obsessions and compulsions are present. From the vignette, both are present. So, F42.2.\n\nSecondary diagnoses:\n\n1. Major Depressive Disorder (MDD): He has depressive symptoms like low mood, anhedonia, insomnia, hopelessness, low energy, difficulty concentrating. Past suicide attempt. This seems like a current episode. ICD-10 F-code: F32.9 (Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified) or F33.9 (Recurrent depressive disorder). From the vignette, he has been struggling for years, so recurrent might be more likely. But it says \"for years,\" so could be recurrent. I'll use F33.9 for recurrent depressive disorder.\n\n2. Alcohol Use Disorder: He had past alcohol abuse during which he attempted suicide. Denies current use, so it might be in remission. ICD-10 F-code: F10.20 (Alcohol dependence, uncomplicated) or F10.10 (Alcohol abuse). Since he abused alcohol in the past, and it was associated with suicide attempt, it's relevant. I'll use F10.20 for dependence, but abuse might be more appropriate. DSM-5-TR uses alcohol use disorder, mild, moderate, severe. From \"abusing alcohol,\" it suggests alcohol use disorder. ICD-10: F10.10 for harmful use or F10.20 for dependence syndrome. I'll use F10.10 for alcohol abuse, but to be precise, F10.20 if dependence is implied. Vignette says \"abusing alcohol,\" so F10.10 might be better. But in remission? It says denies current use, so possibly in remission. ICD-10 has codes for in remission: F10.21 for dependence in remission, etc. But I'll keep it simple and use F10.10 for alcohol abuse.\n\n3. Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia): He avoids social situations due to fear of contamination and offending others. But this might be secondary to OCD. However, it could be comorbid. His fear of saying offensive things and social avoidance might indicate social anxiety. ICD-10 F-code: F40.10 (Social phobia, unspecified).\n\n4. Illness Anxiety Disorder: For his fear of contracting HIV, but it's part of OCD obsessions, so not separate. Better to consider OCD covers it.\n\nOther possibilities: Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) for excessive worry, but worries are specific to obsessions. So, probably not.\n\nPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): No trauma mentioned.\n\nBody Dysmorphic Disorder: Not indicated.\n\nSpecific Phobia: Might be considered for contamination fear, but it's OCD.\n\nSo, my top 5 diagnoses:\n\n1. Primary: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder - F42.2 (or F42.9, I'll use F42.2 for specificity)\n\n2. Secondary: Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent Episode - F33.9\n\n3. Secondary: Alcohol Use Disorder, in early remission or past - F10.10 or F10.20. Since denies current use, perhaps F10.11 for alcohol abuse in remission? ICD-10: F10.11 for harmful use in remission. I'll use F10.11 for alcohol abuse in remission.\n\nBut the vignette says \"denies current alcohol or illicit substance use,\" so it might be in remission. I'll use F10.11.\n\n4. Secondary: Social Anxiety Disorder - F40.10\n\n5. Secondary: Another diagnosis? Perhaps Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder, but OCD is primary. Or Adjustment Disorder? Not likely.\n\nPerhaps Specific Phobia? But contamination fear is OCD.\n\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder? He has worries, but they are obsessions.\n\nI should include diagnoses that are likely based on DSM-5-TR. Let's list:\n\n- OCD is primary.\n\n- MDD is comorbid.\n\n- Past alcohol use disorder.\n\n- Social anxiety might be secondary, but worth including.\n\n- Perhaps Other Specified Anxiety Disorder if not social anxiety, but I think social anxiety fits.\n\nAnother thought: He has intrusive images of hitting someone, which could be related to OCD harm obsessions.\n\nAlso, the hand washing until it feels \"right\" suggests symmetry or ordering, but it's contamination-based.\n\nFor OCD, specifiers: With good or fair insight, as he recognizes it's \"kinda crazy.\"\n\nNow, for the list, I need to output only the structured list with F-codes.\n\nFormat:\n\n1. <Primary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n\n2. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n\n3. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n\n4. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n\n5. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n\nPrimary diagnosis should be the most significant. Clearly, OCD is causing the most impairment and is the focus of the symptoms.\n\nSecondary diagnoses: MDD, alcohol use disorder, social anxiety, and perhaps another like illness anxiety, but I think OCD covers it.\n\nMaybe Panic Disorder? Not mentioned.\n\nSo, my list:\n\n1. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder - F42.2\n\n2. Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent Episode - F33.9\n\n3. Alcohol Use Disorder, in remission - F10.11 (Alcohol abuse in remission)\n\n4. Social Anxiety Disorder - F40.10\n\n5. For the fifth, perhaps Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder, but no need. Or Specific Phobia? Not best.\n\nHe has avoidance behaviors that might be part of OCD, so perhaps no fifth distinct diagnosis. But I need five diagnoses. I can include Generalized Anxiety Disorder if symptoms are separate, but they seem integrated.\n\nRe-read vignette: \"When asked about anxiety, Mr. King said he was worried about contracting diseases such as HIV.\" This leads to OCD. Other worries are intrusive images, etc., all OCD.\n\nDepression is separate.\n\nAlcohol use is past.\n\nSocial anxiety is implied but might be secondary.\n\nPerhaps Illness Anxiety Disorder for HIV fear, but it's an obsession.\n\nIn DSM-5, illness anxiety disorder is separate if preoccupation is with having or acquiring a serious illness, and compulsive behaviors are not prominent, but here compulsions are prominent, so OCD.\n\nSo, for fifth diagnosis, I could include Other Specified Depressive Disorder if MDD is not fully met, but it seems to meet criteria.\n\nHe has suicidal ideation in past, current denies.\n\nSymptoms: low mood, anhedonia, insomnia, hopelessness, low energy, difficulty concentrating. That's at least five symptoms, lasting for years, so MDD recurrent.\n\nPerhaps Dysthymia? But it says depressive symptoms for years, could be persistent depressive disorder, but with clear episodes, MDD might be better.\n\nDSM-5-TR: If symptoms meet criteria for MDD, code MDD. He has had suicide attempt, so likely MDD.\n\nFor alcohol, since denies current use, it might be in sustained remission, but vignette doesn't specify duration, so I'll use alcohol abuse in remission.\n\nAnother idea: Specific Phobia, situational type, for avoidance of public transport, etc., but it's due to contamination fears.\n\nI think social anxiety is a good fit for fear of offending others and social avoidance.\n\nSo, list:\n\n1. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder - F42.2\n\n2. Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent - F33.9\n\n3. Alcohol Use Disorder, in early remission - F10.11 (I need to confirm code: ICD-10 F10.11 is harmful use in remission. For dependence in remission, it's F10.21. From \"abusing alcohol,\" harmful use is likely, so F10.11.)\n\n4. Social Anxiety Disorder - F40.10\n\n5. I need a fifth. Perhaps Other Specified Anxiety Disorder? But not necessary. Maybe Adjustment Disorder? No stressor mentioned.\n\nHe has insomnia, which could be part of depression or separate, but not a primary diagnosis.\n\nPerhaps Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder? No.\n\nI could include Specific Phobia, but it's redundant with OCD.\n\nPerhaps no fifth diagnosis, but the instruction says \"top 5 most likely diagnoses,\" so I must list five. I can include less likely ones.\n\nMaybe Generalized Anxiety Disorder? He has worries, but they are obsessions, so not GAD.\n\nFrom vignette, he has difficulty concentrating and making decisions, which are part of depression.\n\nI think the fifth could be Other Specified Depressive Disorder if MDD is not fully specified, but it seems to be.\n\nAnother possibility: Body Dysmorphic Disorder? No.\n\nHoarding Disorder? Not mentioned.\n\nTrichotillomania? No.\n\nExcoriation? No.\n\nPerhaps Panic Disorder? No panic attacks mentioned.\n\nSo, for fifth, I'll include Illness Anxiety Disorder, but as said, it's likely part of OCD.\n\nTo be thorough, I'll list Illness Anxiety Disorder as a secondary diagnosis.\n\nICD-10 for illness anxiety disorder: F45.21 (Hypochondriasis). In DSM-5, it's illness anxiety disorder, ICD-10 F45.21.\n\nBut in the vignette, the HIV fear is an obsession, so OCD might cover it.\n\nI think OCD is the primary, and others are comorbid.\n\nFinal list:\n\n1. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder - F42.2\n\n2. Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent Episode - F33.9\n\n3. Alcohol Use Disorder, in remission - F10.11\n\n4. Social Anxiety Disorder - F40.10\n\n5. Illness Anxiety Disorder - F45.21\n\nBut illness anxiety disorder and OCD can be comorbid, but in this case, the illness fear is part of obsessions, so perhaps not separate. However, for differential, it might be considered.\n\nDSM-5-TR allows for multiple diagnoses if criteria are met.\n\nHe recognizes fears are \"kinda crazy,\" which is insight, so for illness anxiety, insight can vary.\n\nI think I'll go with this list.\n\nEnsure F-codes are correct.\n\n- F42.2: Mixed obsessional thoughts and acts\n\n- F33.9: Recurrent depressive disorder, unspecified\n\n- F10.11: Harmful use of alcohol, in remission\n\n- F40.10: Social phobia, unspecified\n\n- F45.21: Hypochondriasis\n\nIn DSM-5, illness anxiety disorder is coded under F45.21.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, output only the list without reasoning.",

    "vignette":"Trevor Lewis, a 32-year-old single man living with his parents, was brought to his psychiatric consultation by his mother. She noted that since adolescence, her son had been concerned with germs, which led to long-standing hand-washing and showering rituals. During the prior 6 months, his symptoms had markedly worsened. He had become preoccupied with being infected by COVID-19 and spent the day cleaning not only his body but all of his clothing and linen. He had begun to insist that the family also wash their clothing and linen regularly, and that they keep the windows shut all the time. He allowed no visitors to their home. When the parents were occasionally exposed to other people by going outside, he insisted that they wear their masks in his presence for the ensuing 48 hours. The resulting conflicts had led to the current consultation.\n\nMr. Lewis had in the past received a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and cognitive-behavioral therapy for his symptoms. These had had some positive effects, and he had been able to complete high school successfully. Nevertheless, his symptoms had prevented him from completing college or working outside the home; he had long felt that his home was relatively germ-free in comparison to the outside world. However, over the past 6 months, he had increasingly indicated that home, too, was contaminated, including with COVID-19.\n\nAt the time of presentation, Mr. Lewis had no other obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms such as sexual, religious, or other obsessions; appearance or acquisition preoccupations; or body-focused repetitive behaviors. However, in the past he had also experienced obsessions relating to fears of harming himself or others, together with associated checking compulsions (e.g., checking that the stove was switched off). He had a childhood history of motor tics. During high school, he found that marijuana reduced his anxiety. He denied having had access to marijuana and other psychoactive substances since leaving school.\n\nMr. Lewis was interviewed over video using a telehealth system. He appeared disheveled and unkempt. He was completely convinced that COVID-19 had contaminated his home and that his washing and cleaning were necessary to stay uninfected. When challenged with information about COVID-19\u2019s mode of spread, he answered that COVID-19 might come into the home through an open window or the sweat of visitors, and his masked parents could certainly get infected by going to the grocery store. He added that his parents had tried to convince him that he was excessively worried, but he did not believe them. In fact, his worries kept returning even when he tried to think of something else.\n\nThere was no evidence of hallucinations or of a formal thought disorder. He denied an intention to harm or kill himself or others. He was cognitively intact.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading through the clinical case vignette about Trevor Lewis. I need to extract all relevant information and organize it logically to support my diagnostic reasoning. The rubric emphasizes sophisticated data extraction and nuanced diagnostic reasoning, so I must pay attention to subtle cues and patterns.\n\nFirst, Trevor is a 32-year-old man with long-standing symptoms since adolescence. He has germ-related obsessions leading to hand-washing and showering rituals. Over the past six months, symptoms worsened with a specific preoccupation with COVID-19 contamination. He engages in extensive cleaning rituals for himself, his clothing, linen, and insists family do the same. He restricts visitors and enforces mask-wearing rules for his parents after they go outside. This has caused conflicts leading to the consultation.\n\nHe has a history of treatment with SSRIs and CBT, which helped him complete high school but not college or work. He perceives his home as germ-free compared to the outside, but recently, he believes home is contaminated too. Past symptoms included fears of harming himself or others with checking compulsions. Childhood motor tics and past marijuana use for anxiety, but no current substance use.\n\nDuring the telehealth interview, he appears disheveled and unkempt. He holds firm beliefs about COVID-19 contamination despite challenges. No hallucinations or formal thought disorder, no suicidal or homicidal intent, cognitively intact.\n\nNow, organizing this information: Core symptoms are obsessions (contamination fears) and compulsions (cleaning rituals). The beliefs are fixed and not amenable to reason, which might indicate overvalued ideas or even delusional thinking. The history shows a chronic course with exacerbation recently. Past tics and harm-related obsessions\/complusions are notable. The impact is significant, affecting his ability to work and socialize.\n\nMoving to diagnostic reasoning. The primary consideration is Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) given the clear obsessions and compulsions. However, the conviction in his beliefs might lean towards OCD with absent insight or possibly a delusional disorder. But OCD typically involves insight, though it can be poor. The DSM-5-TR allows for specifiers like \"with absent insight\/delusional beliefs,\" which might fit here.\n\nDifferential diagnoses include Illness Anxiety Disorder, but that focuses more on preoccupation with having a serious illness rather than contamination fears leading to rituals. Body Dysmorphic Disorder is ruled out as there are no appearance preoccupations. Hoarding Disorder isn't mentioned. Trichotillomania or Excoriation Disorder aren't present either.\n\nGiven the childhood motor tics, there might be a tic-related OCD specifier. Also, past harm obsessions with checking compulsions align with OCD. The absence of current substance use rules out substance-induced OCD. No psychotic features like hallucinations, but the fixed beliefs could be delusional, so Delusional Disorder, Somatic Type, might be considered. However, the compulsions are more characteristic of OCD.\n\nOther possibilities include Generalized Anxiety Disorder, but the rituals are specific to obsessions, not generalized worry. Social Anxiety Disorder isn't indicated as the fear is contamination, not social scrutiny. Illness Anxiety Disorder involves excessive worry about health without the rituals, so less likely. Somatic Symptom Disorder is not applicable as there are no somatic symptoms.\n\nGiven the chronic course since adolescence, OCD is the most fitting. The specifier \"with absent insight\/delusional beliefs\" might apply due to his fixed conviction. Additionally, Tic Disorder could be listed given the history. Past marijuana use for anxiety but no current use, so no substance-related disorder.\n\nNow, structuring the diagnoses: Primary is OCD with absent insight. Secondary could include Past Tic Disorder, though not current. Also, consider Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder if there's any nuance, but OCD fits well. Delusional Disorder is a differential but less likely due to the presence of compulsions. Illness Anxiety Disorder is another differential. Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder isn't relevant here. No depressive or bipolar symptoms mentioned, so those aren't priorities.\n\nTop five diagnoses: \n1. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder with absent insight\/delusional beliefs.\n2. Past history of Tic Disorder (since childhood, but not current, so perhaps as a secondary note).\n3. Illness Anxiety Disorder as a rule-out, but given the rituals, OCD takes precedence.\n4. Delusional Disorder, Somatic Type.\n5. Generalized Anxiety Disorder as another differential due to excessive worry, but the rituals point more to OCD.\n\nBut the rubric says top five diagnoses with ICD-10 codes. So, I need to list the most likely primary and four secondaries. The primary is clearly OCD. Secondary could include Tic Disorder, Illness Anxiety Disorder, Delusional Disorder, and maybe Adjustment Disorder with anxiety, but the symptoms are chronic, so Adjustment Disorder isn't fitting. Alternatively, Other Specified Anxiety Disorder, but that's vague.\n\nPerhaps the secondaries should be conditions that are part of the differential or comorbidities. Given the history, Tic Disorder is relevant. Also, the past marijuana use might indicate Cannabis Use Disorder, but he denied current use, so in remission possibly. But the vignette says he denied access since leaving school, so maybe not a current issue.\n\nAnother consideration is that the worsening coincided with the pandemic, which might trigger OCD symptoms. But that doesn't change the diagnosis.\n\nI need to base only on provided info. So, top five: OCD, Tic Disorder, Illness Anxiety Disorder, Delusional Disorder, and maybe Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder if there's any ambiguity, but OCD covers it.\n\nBut the rubric emphasizes nuanced differential, so including less obvious ones. For example, Social Anxiety Disorder could be considered because he avoids visitors, but the fear is contamination, not social evaluation. So, not likely.\n\nLet's list with ICD-10 codes:\n1. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder - F42\n2. Persistent Motor Tic Disorder - F95.1 (since childhood history)\n3. Illness Anxiety Disorder - F45.21\n4. Delusional Disorder - F22\n5. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder - F41.8 (for generalized anxiety features, though not prominent)\n\nBut the vignette says no other OCD-related symptoms currently, but past harm obsessions. So, OCD is still the main. Tic disorder is historical. Illness Anxiety Disorder is a differential because he's preoccupied with getting COVID-19, but the rituals make OCD more likely. Delusional Disorder due to fixed beliefs. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder as a catch-all.\n\nHowever, the rubric says top five most likely, so I should prioritize based on likelihood. Primary is OCD. Then, given the tics, Tic Disorder is secondary. Then, Delusional Disorder due to poor insight. Illness Anxiety Disorder. And perhaps Unspecified Anxiety Disorder as fifth.\n\nBut let's check ICD-10 codes: OCD is F42, Tic Disorder is F95.9 for unspecified, but since motor tics, F95.1. Delusional Disorder is F22. Illness Anxiety Disorder is F45.21. For fifth, maybe Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder, but that's F42.8. Alternatively, since past marijuana use, but no current, so not listed.\n\nThe response should be only the list, no reasoning. So, final list based on analysis.",

    "vignette":"Vincent Mancini, a 26-year-old single white man, was brought for an outpatient evaluation by his parents because they were distressed by his symptoms. Since age 13, he had been excessively preoccupied with his \u201cscarred\u201d skin, \u201cthinning\u201d hair, \u201casymmetrical\u201d ears, and \u201cwimpy\u201d and \u201cinadequately muscular\u201d body build. Although he looked normal, Mr. Mancini was completely convinced that he looked \u201cugly and hideous,\u201d and he believed that other people talked about him and made fun of him because of his appearance.\n\nMr. Mancini spent 5\u20136 hours a day compulsively checking his disliked body areas in mirrors and other reflecting surfaces such as windows, excessively styling his hair \u201cto create an illusion of fullness,\u201d pulling on his ears to try to \u201ceven them up,\u201d and comparing his appearance with that of others. He compulsively picked his skin, sometimes using razor blades, to try to \u201cclear it up.\u201d He lifted weights daily and regularly wore several layers of T-shirts to look bigger. He almost always wore a cap to hide his hair. He had received dermatological treatment for his skin concerns but felt it had not helped.\n\nMr. Mancini missed several months of high school because he was too preoccupied to do schoolwork, felt compelled to leave class to check mirrors, and was too self-conscious to be seen by others; for these reasons, he was unable to attend college. He became socially withdrawn and did not date \u201cbecause no girl would want to go out with someone as ugly as me.\u201d He often considered suicide because he felt that life was not worth living \u201cif I look like a freak\u201d and because he felt isolated and ostracized because of his \u201cugliness.\u201d His parents expressed concern over his \u201cviolent outbursts,\u201d which occurred when he was feeling especially angry and distressed over how he looked or when they tried to pull him away from the mirror.\n\nMr. Mancini reported depressed mood, anhedonia, worthlessness, poor concentration, and suicidal ideation, all of which he attributed to his appearance concerns. To self-medicate his distress over his appearance, he drank alcohol and smoked marijuana. He used protein powder to \u201cbuild up muscle\u201d but denied use of anabolic steroids or other performance-enhancing drugs or drugs of abuse. He had distressing and problematic anxiety in social situations during his late teens that he attributed to feeling \u201cstupid,\u201d but he denied recent social anxiety that was unrelated to his appearance concerns.\n\nMr. Mancini had no significant medical history and was taking no medication. His mother had obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).\n\nMr. Mancini was neatly dressed and groomed and wore a baseball cap. He had no obvious physical defects. His eye contact was poor. He was oriented and grossly cognitively intact. His affect was irritable; his mood was depressed, with passive suicidal ideation. He had no psychomotor abnormalities; his speech was normal. He was completely convinced that he was ugly and was certain that other people talked about him and laughed at him because of his physical appearance; he had no other psychotic symptoms. He believed his appearance \u201cdefects\u201d were real and not attributable to a psychiatric disorder.",

    "model_thoughts":"Hmm, this is a complex clinical vignette that requires careful analysis. The patient presents with severe preoccupation with perceived physical flaws, compulsive behaviors related to appearance checking and grooming, and significant functional impairment. \n\nThe core symptoms strongly point to body dysmorphic disorder as the primary diagnosis - the excessive focus on minor or imagined defects, time-consuming compulsive behaviors, and conviction about being ugly despite looking normal. The suicidal ideation and functional impairment further support this.\n\nGiven the comorbid depressive symptoms, persistent depressive disorder or major depressive disorder should be considered, but the timeline suggests the depression is secondary to the appearance concerns. The social withdrawal and distress in social situations could indicate social anxiety disorder, though it's noted this is tied to appearance concerns. \n\nThe compulsive behaviors and family history of OCD warrant obsessive-compulsive disorder in the differential, though the content is specifically appearance-focused. The substance use appears to be self-medication rather than a primary disorder. The irritability and outbursts might suggest intermittent explosive disorder, but these seem reactive to appearance-related distress.\n\nThe patient's firm conviction about being ugly could border on delusional thinking, but the vignette specifies no other psychotic symptoms, ruling out schizophrenia spectrum disorders.

    "vignette":"Wendy Nichols was a 47-year-old single white woman referred to a community mental health care team for the management of a mixed presentation of low mood and generalized anxiety. She had never taken any psychiatric medication but had completed a course of cognitive-behavioral therapy for a previous depressive episode 5 years earlier.\n\nMs. Nichols\u2019s medical history was unremarkable. She lived alone in a two-bedroom apartment and had no family or friends nearby. She had a university degree and worked as a part-time sales assistant in a charity thrift shop. She said she had dated in college but had \u201csomehow been too busy\u201d in recent years.\n\nOn initial examination, she was an articulate, well-dressed woman who was coherent and cooperative. She was clearly in a low mood. She complained about poor concentration and difficulties getting organized. She denied any substance misuse.\n\nThe clinician noted that Ms. Nichols\u2019s purse was filled with bills and other papers. When asked, the patient initially shrugged it off, indicating that she \u201ccarried around my office.\u201d When the interviewer inquired further, it emerged that Ms. Nichols had had difficulty discarding important business papers, newspapers, and magazines for as long as she could remember. She felt that it all started when her mother got rid of her old toys when she was age 12. Now, many years later, Ms. Nichols\u2019s apartment had become filled with books, stationery, crafts, plastic packages, cardboard boxes, and all sorts of other things. She said she knew it was a little crazy, but these items could be handy one day. She said, \u201cWaste not, want not.\u201d She also reported that many of her possessions were beautiful, unique, and irreplaceable, or had strong sentimental value. The thought of discarding any of these possessions caused her great distress.\n\nOver a series of interviews, the clinician developed a clearer understanding of the extent of the problem. Rooms in Ms. Nichols\u2019s apartment had begun to fill when she was in her early 30s, and by the time of the interview, she had little room to live. Her kitchen was almost entirely full, so she used a mini fridge and a toaster oven that she had wedged into piles of paper in the hallway. She ate her meals in the only available chair. At night, she moved a pile of papers from the bed onto that chair so she could sleep. Ms. Nichols continued to buy from the charity thrift store where she worked and also picked up daily free newspapers that she planned to read in the future.\n\nEmbarrassed by the condition of her apartment, she had told no one about her behavior and had invited no one into her apartment for at least 15 years. She also avoided social functions and dating, because\u2014despite being naturally sociable and very lonely\u2014she knew she would be unable to reciprocate with invitations to her home. She was surprised to have told the clinician, because she had not told even her own mother, but she would like help. She declined the clinician\u2019s offer of a home visit or a telehealth visit but did offer some photographs of her living room from her telephone\u2019s camera. The photographs showed furniture, papers, boxes, and clothes piled from floor to ceiling.\n\nMs. Nichols described long-standing feelings of sadness and loneliness, as well as anxiety whenever she tried to clean up or whenever someone tried to befriend her. She denied other psychiatric symptoms, including delusions, hallucinations, obsessions, and compulsive behavior.",

    "vignette":"Zoe Oliver was a 22-year-old single woman who presented to her general practitioner after reading a magazine article about trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder). She had never previously told anyone other than her mother about her hair pulling, but the magazine had indicated that it was fairly common and treatable. She was pessimistic that anything would work, but she and her mother agreed that she should seek help.\n\nMs. Oliver\u2019s hair pulling most often took place as a ritual when she returned home from her job as a paralegal. She would search for hairs of a particular texture from the crown of her head (though she also pulled from her eyebrows, eyelashes, and pubic region). She felt intense relief if the hair came out with its root. She would then typically bite off the root of the hair and swallow the rest of the hair. She had never experienced any gastrointestinal symptoms after hair swallowing. She said the hair pulling had begun at age 12, and she had never known anyone with similar behaviors.\n\nMs. Oliver fought hard to stop the behavior and, at times, had been able to stop for several months at a time. When the hair pulling returned, she would again feel ashamed and angry at herself. Scarves and hats covered the bald patch, but she would usually withdraw from friends and boyfriends to avoid being caught.\n\nEven when demoralized about the behavior, Ms. Oliver did not have vegetative symptoms of depression. Aside from fears of being found out, she lacked prominent anxiety. She denied obsessions, compulsions, hoarding, tics, and preoccupations with either bodily defects or having an illness. She also had no history of a range of other body-focused repetitive behaviors, such as lip biting or cheek chewing, in either herself or her close family members.\n\nWhen asked what she would do if she could not find the \u201cright\u201d kind of hair to pull, she admitted that she would often pick at her skin or at a scab. The scab\u2019s coming off in just the right way led to a feeling of relief that was similar to that which she experienced when hair pulling. She would also sometimes chew and swallow her scabs. Ms. Oliver often picked at scabs on her back so that the lesions would not be easily visible to others. Nevertheless, the resultant scarring did lead her to avoid situations like beach parties and dates and other situations where her behavior might be exposed.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the clinical vignette about Zoe Oliver. The user provided a detailed case and asked for a diagnosis following the DSM-5-TR criteria. I need to extract all relevant information and organize it logically to support my reasoning. \n\nFirst, the patient is a 22-year-old woman with a history of hair-pulling since age 12. She pulls hair from multiple areas, feels relief when the root comes out, and swallows the hair. She also engages in skin picking, especially when she can't find the right hair, and swallows scabs. There's significant distress and impairment in social functioning due to shame and avoidance. \n\nHmm, the key symptoms align with Trichotillomania (Hair-Pulling Disorder), especially the recurrent pulling, attempts to stop, and distress. But she also has skin picking, which might be a separate diagnosis. The vignette mentions no depression, anxiety, obsessions, or other body-focused behaviors. So, primary diagnosis is likely Trichotillomania. \n\nNext, skin picking is present and causes similar relief and impairment, so Excoriation Disorder should be considered. She swallows hair and scabs without GI symptoms, which could be related to the disorders but might also hint at a possible eating disorder, though no other symptoms are noted. \n\nWait, the user emphasized not to include non-psychiatric diagnoses and to stick to the top 5. Let me list the most likely based on DSM-5-TR. Trichotillomania is primary, then Excoriation Disorder as secondary. Other possibilities? Maybe Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder if the swallowing is a separate compulsion, but it's tied to the hair-pulling and skin picking. No evidence of OCD, BDD, or tic disorders. Avoidance due to shame could be Social Anxiety, but she denies prominent anxiety. Better to focus on the main issues. \n\nOkay, so the structured list should start with Trichotillomania, then Excoriation Disorder. Other secondary diagnoses could include Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder for the swallowing behavior, and maybe Unspecified Anxiety Disorder due to avoidance, but the vignette says she lacks prominent anxiety. Perhaps Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood given her demoralization, but no vegetative depression symptoms. \n\nLet me double-check the ICD-10 codes. Trichotillomania is F63.3, Excoriation Disorder is L98.1 but that's not an F-code. Wait, in ICD-10, Excoriation Disorder is under F42.4 as Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder? Actually, DSM-5 lists it as a separate disorder, but ICD-10 might categorize it under F42.8 or F42.9. I need to ensure the codes match DSM-5-TR. Trichotillomania is F63.3, Excoriation Disorder is F42.4? No, that's for OCD. Let me recall: in ICD-10, Trichotillomania is F63.3, Excoriation Disorder is L98.1 but that's dermatological. Psychiatrically, it might be F42.8 (Other OCD). But the user asked for F-codes only. So perhaps use F42.8 for Excoriation. \n\nMaybe list Trichotillomania as primary, then Excoriation Disorder as secondary with F42.8. Other secondaries could include Other Specified OCD-Related Disorder for the swallowing, Unspecified Anxiety Disorder for avoidance, and Adjustment Disorder. But let's prioritize based on the vignette. She has no other comorbidities mentioned, so stick to the evident disorders. \n\nFinal list: Trichotillomania as primary, Excoriation Disorder as secondary, and since she has both, maybe list them as co-occurring. The other secondaries could be rule-outs but not prominent. Perhaps Other Specified OCD-Related Disorder for the combined symptoms, Unspecified Anxiety Disorder due to social avoidance, and no depression or other issues. \n\nWait, the user wants top 5 diagnoses. I can include Trichotillomania, Excoriation, Other Specified OCD-Related Disorder, Unspecified Anxiety Disorder, and maybe No Diagnosis on Axis I? But that seems redundant. Better to list the most relevant based on DSM-5. \n\nLet me confirm: She meets criteria for Trichotillomania (F63.3) and Excoriation Disorder (F42.8 in ICD-10 for Other Specified OCD-Related Disorder). The swallowing might be part of these disorders. Avoidance could be Social Anxiety (F40.10), but she denies anxiety. Maybe Other Specified Anxiety Disorder (F41.8) or Unspecified (F41.9). Adjustment Disorder (F43.20) is possible due to distress. But the top two are clear. \n\nOkay, I'll go with Trichotillomania as primary, then Excoriation Disorder, Other Specified OCD-Related Disorder for swallowing, Unspecified Anxiety Disorder for avoidance, and Adjustment Disorder as last. Now, format the response exactly as requested.",

At the time of the adoption, Adriana\u2019s medical records were reviewed by a local pediatrician, who found no problems aside from growth parameters that were all below the 5th percentile. When the adoptive parents met her at the orphanage, Adriana approached without shyness and visited easily with them. The parents had been pleasantly reassured by the child\u2019s happy demeanor and her spontaneous, warm hugs.\n\nNot long after her adoption, Adriana began to clearly seek out her mother for comfort when distressed or hurt. At most other times, however, Adriana did not distinguish between strangers and her family. In the grocery store, she would warmly hug whoever was waiting next to them in line. In group and family settings, she would frequently try to sit in the laps of people she had barely met. Once, at a shopping mall, she tried to leave with another family. Her parents were concerned that this behavior might put her at risk of abduction or abuse.\n\nCompared with other children her age, Adriana had trouble taking turns and sitting for circle time at school. She interrupted, intruded into classmates\u2019 play space, and occasionally hit others. Small triggers upset her for prolonged periods. She had trouble soothing herself but would generally calm down if held by her teacher or a parent.\n\nAdriana lived with her adoptive mother and father and her 12-year-old brother, who was the biological child of her parents. Her mother stayed home for Adriana\u2019s first year in the United States, but Adriana had been attending a half-day child care program for the past year. Her mother noted progress in the child\u2019s development, although she remained language delayed, with comprehension better than productive language.

    "vignette":"Traumatic Event: Bethany Pinsky, age 23, had gone to a theater to see the local premiere of a big-budget movie. As she settled into her seat, waiting for the show to begin, a young man in a ski mask suddenly appeared in front of the screen. Brandishing an assault rifle, he fired directly into the audience. She saw many people get shot, including the woman sitting next to her. People all around began screaming, and there was a confused stampede for the exit door. Terrified, she somehow fought her way to the exit and escaped, uninjured, to the parking lot, where police cars were just arriving.\n\nCharles Quigley, age 25, went to the same movie theater at the same time. He too feared for his life. Hiding behind a row of seats, he was able to crawl to the aisle and sprint to the exit. Although covered in blood, he escaped without physical injury.\n\nBethany and Charles, 2 Days Later: Two days later, both Ms. Pinsky and Mr. Quigley considered themselves \u201cnervous wrecks.\u201d Grateful that they were alive and uninjured, they nevertheless found themselves extremely anxious and on edge. They jumped at the slightest noise. They kept watching television for the latest information about the shooting, but every time there was actual videotaped footage of the event, they experienced panic attacks, broke out into a sweat, were unable to calm down, and could not stop thinking about the traumatic event. They could not sleep at night because of nightmares, and during the day they felt assaulted by intrusive and unwelcome memories of gunshots, screams, and their own personal terror during the event.\n\nBethany, 2 Weeks Later: Ms. Pinsky had reclaimed most of her pretraumatic thoughts, feelings, and behaviors within 2 weeks. Although traumatic reminders of the shooting sometimes led to a brief panic or physiological reaction, these did not dominate her waking hours. She no longer experienced nightmares. She knew that she would never forget what happened in that movie theater, but for the most part, her life was returning to normal and had returned to the trajectory it had been following before the shootings occurred.\n\nCharles, 2 Weeks Later: Mr. Quigley had not recovered 2 weeks later. He felt emotionally constricted and unable to experience pleasant or positive feelings. He jumped at the slightest sound, he was unable to focus on his work, and his sleep was fitful and marked by traumatic nightmares. He tried to avoid any reminders of the shootings but nevertheless relentlessly recalled the sound of gunfire, the screams, and the sticky feel of the blood pouring out of his neighbor\u2019s chest and onto him as he hid behind the seats.

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the vignette to extract all relevant clinical details. The patient is Charles Quigley, age 25, who experienced a traumatic event at a movie theater shooting. Both he and Bethany were present, but Bethany recovered within two weeks while Charles did not.\n\nFirst, I need to focus on Charles's symptoms as described. Two days after the event, he's extremely anxious, jumps at noises, has panic attacks when seeing footage, nightmares, intrusive memories, and can't sleep. Two weeks later, Bethany is mostly back to normal, but Charles still has emotional constriction, inability to feel positive emotions, hypervigilance (jumping at sounds), poor concentration, traumatic nightmares, avoidance of reminders, persistent intrusive recollections (sounds, screams, blood), dissociation (feeling disconnected from surroundings and self), and a sense that his life has changed.\n\nNow, organizing this information. The key here is the timeline: exposure to a life-threatening traumatic event, immediate stress response, and persistence of symptoms beyond two weeks. For Charles, symptoms have lasted more than two weeks but less than a month since the vignette ends at the two-week mark. Bethany's recovery highlights that Charles's symptoms are prolonged.\n\nDiagnostic reasoning: The primary consideration is trauma-related disorders. Given the exposure to a traumatic event with threatened death, and symptoms like intrusive memories, nightmares, avoidance, negative alterations in mood (emotional constriction, inability to feel positive), hyperarousal (hypervigilance, startle), and dissociation\u2014this strongly points to Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) since it's been two weeks. However, PTSD requires symptoms for more than one month, so at this point, ASD is more appropriate.\n\nDifferential diagnoses: Adjustment Disorder with anxiety could be considered due to the stressor, but the severity and specific trauma symptoms make ASD more likely. Panic Disorder might be relevant due to panic attacks, but these are tied to trauma reminders. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is possible given anxiety and poor concentration, but the trauma focus is central. Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) could co-occur due to emotional constriction and anhedonia, but it's secondary here. Dissociative disorders might be considered due to dissociation, but it's part of the trauma response.\n\nPrioritizing: ASD is primary due to the acute trauma response with all clusters present. Secondary diagnoses could include Panic Disorder (panic attacks triggered by reminders), Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder if not fully meeting ASD, and MDD as a potential comorbidity. I need to ensure the F-codes are accurate: ASD is F43.0, Panic Disorder F41.0, Adjustment Disorder F43.29, Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder F43.8, and MDD F32.9.\n\nWait, the vignette says Charles feels emotionally constricted and unable to experience pleasant feelings, which aligns with negative mood in ASD. Also, dissociation is present. So ASD fits. Since it's only been two weeks, PTSD isn't applicable yet. The other diagnoses are less likely but included for differential. Let me confirm the symptoms against DSM-5-TR criteria for ASD: exposure to trauma, intrusion symptoms (memories, nightmares), negative mood, dissociation, avoidance, arousal. Yes, all present. So primary is ASD. Others are secondary possibilities.",

On the day of the accident, Dylan was riding in the front passenger seat when, as the car was pulling out of a driveway, it was struck by an oncoming SUV that was speeding through a yellow light. The car he was in was hit squarely on the driver\u2019s side, which caused the car to roll over once and come to rest right side up. The collision of metal on metal made an extremely loud noise. The driver of the car, a high school classmate, was knocked unconscious for a short period and was bleeding from a gash in his forehead. Upon seeing his injured friend, Dylan became afraid that his friend might be dead. His friend in the back seat of the car was frantically trying to unlatch her seat belt. Dylan\u2019s door was jammed, and Dylan feared that their car might catch fire while he was stuck in it. After a few minutes, the driver, Dylan, and the other passenger were able to exit through the passenger doors and move away from the car. They realized that the driver of the SUV was unharmed and had already called the police. An ambulance was on its way. All three were transported to a local emergency room, where they were attended to and released to their parents\u2019 care after a few hours.\n\nDylan had not had a good night\u2019s sleep since the accident. He often awoke in the middle of the night with his heart racing, visualizing oncoming headlights. He was having trouble concentrating and was unable to effectively complete his homework. His parents, who had begun to drive him to and from school, noticed that he was anxious every time they pulled out of a driveway or crossed an intersection. Although he had recently received his driving permit, he refused to practice driving with his father. He was also unusually short-tempered with his parents, his younger sisters, and his friends. He had recently gone to see a movie but had walked out of the theater before the movie started; he complained that the sound system was too loud. His concerned parents tried to talk to him about his stress, but he would irritably cut them off. After doing poorly on an important exam, however, he accepted the encouragement of a favorite teacher to go to a psychiatrist.\n\nWhen seen, Dylan described additional difficulties. He hated that he was \u201cjumpy\u201d around loud noises, and he could not shake the image of his injured and unresponsive friend. He had waves of anger toward the driver of the SUV. He reported feeling embarrassed and disappointed in himself for being reluctant to practice driving. He stated that about 5 years earlier, he had witnessed the near-drowning of one of his younger sisters.

When unexpectedly startled by sudden noises, he tended to fly into a rage. That was apparently one reason he had chosen to be a self-employed electrician: he could work by himself. Similarly, he enjoyed hunting and gardening, activities that he could enjoy in quiet solitude.\n\nReluctantly, he described intrusive memories of watching his fellow soldiers die in the field, which caused him enormous shame, guilt, and sadness, Several times a week, he awakes in a panicky sweat after a combat nightmare, although, as he said, \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous. Those guys have been dead for 50 years.\u201d\n\nAlthough these symptoms are very distressing, Mr. Reynolds is most worried about his \u201chair-trigger\u201d temper. Without cause, he finds himself antagonizing other drivers who cut him off, confronting strangers who stand too close to him in checkout lines, and shifting into \u201cattack mode\u201d when approached from behind by others. He springs into this aggressive mode automatically, without a thought or consideration of the circumstances. Although he keeps a handgun in the console of his car for self-protection, Mr. Reynolds has no intention of harming others. He is always remorseful after a threatening incident and worries that he might inadvertently hurt someone. Most recently, while drifting off to sleep on his physician\u2019s examination table, a nurse touched his foot, and he leapt up and began cursing in a threatening manner. He felt as if he were back on guard duty, when he was accidentally dozing, and an incoming mortar round stunned him into action. His reaction scared both the nurse and himself.\n\nMr. Reynolds\u2019s symptoms apparently began soon after he left Vietnam, where he served as a field radio operator. He never sought help for his symptoms, apparently because of his independent and self-reliant nature. After retirement as a self-employed electrician, he spent almost all of his time at home. During these past few years, his wife and adult children became more aware of his various symptoms, including how they were putting a severe strain on his family relationships and overall happiness.\n\nMr. Reynolds was raised in a loving family that struggled financially as Midwestern farmers. At age 20, Mr. Reynolds was drafted into the U.S. Army and deployed to Vietnam. He described himself as having been upbeat and happy prior to his army induction. He said he enjoyed basic training and his first few weeks in Vietnam, until one of his comrades got killed. At that point, all he cared about was getting home alive, even if it meant killing others. His personality changed from that of a happy-go-lucky farm boy to a terrified, overprotective soldier. Upon returning to civilian life, he managed to get a graduate business degree, but he became a self-employed electrician because of his need to stay isolated in his work. In his retirement, he hoped to volunteer, garden, and get some \u201cpeace and quiet.\u201d It turned out, however, that his retirement was much like the rest of his adult life: although he could occasionally settle into one of his hobbies, most of his days were filled with tension, guilt, and arguments.\n\nDespite having used alcohol and marijuana during his early adulthood, he had not consumed excessive alcohol for several decades or used marijuana since the age of 30. He had no legal history.\n\nOn examination, Mr. Reynolds was a well-groomed man who appeared anxious and somewhat guarded. He was coherent and articulate. His speech was at a normal rate, but the pace accelerated when he discussed disturbing content. He denied depression but was anxious. His affect was somewhat constricted but appropriate to content. His thought process was coherent and linear. He denied all suicidal and homicidal ideation. He had no psychotic symptoms, delusions, or hallucinations. He had very good insight. He was well oriented and seemed to have above-average intelligence.",

That means extracting subtle cues and organizing them to show a nuanced understanding. The diagnostic reasoning must consider less obvious possibilities and articulate a clear rationale.\n\nLooking at the vignette, Mr. Reynolds is a 75-year-old veteran with long-standing symptoms. Key points include intrusive memories, nightmares, hypervigilance, irritability, and aggressive outbursts, all tracing back to his combat experience in Vietnam. The assistant must prioritize PTSD as the primary diagnosis given the clear trauma history and symptom alignment.\n\nBut the rubric requires considering secondary diagnoses.

However, the history of past alcohol and marijuana use might warrant a secondary diagnosis of Alcohol Use Disorder in sustained remission, especially since he hasn't used excessively for decades.\n\nAnxiety is present but better explained by PTSD. The lack of psychotic symptoms rules out disorders like schizophrenia. The assistant might consider Unspecified Anxiety Disorder as a less likely alternative but secondary. Persistent Depressive Disorder could be a possibility due to chronic tension and guilt, though depression is denied.\n\nThe assistant needs to ensure each diagnosis has a corresponding ICD-10 F-code.

    "vignette":"Franklin Sims was a 21-year-old single African American man who sought treatment at a university-affiliated community mental health care clinic because he felt \u201cstressed out,\u201d withdrawn from friends, and \u201cworried about money.\u201d He said he had been feeling depressed for 3 months, and he attributed the \u201cnosedive\u201d to the end of a 3-year romantic relationship shortly after he and his girlfriend had seriously discussed marriage.\n\nMr. Sims, the son of working-class parents, had supported himself financially since high school and was accustomed to feeling nervous about making ends meet. He was angered by his girlfriend\u2019s decision to end the relationship, particularly her failure to understand his concerns about establishing financial stability. He increasingly ruminated about money, his grades, and his future.\n\nMr. Sims was a full-time undergraduate employed as a full-time midnight-shift warehouse worker. He was accustomed to this schedule, but he had increasingly found it difficult to concentrate in class after staying awake all night at the warehouse. When he had a day off, his sleep and energy were fine, and he still enjoyed hanging out with his friends. His appetite was unchanged, and his physical health was good. His grades had recently declined, however, and he had become increasingly discouraged about money and about being his family\u2019s first college student. His parents did not understand why he had decided to attend an out-of-state university, and he was increasingly dissatisfied with life on the predominantly white college campus after some recent experiences of racial discrimination. He had not previously sought any type of mental health care services, but a supportive cousin suggested that he see a therapist after he had told her that he sometimes just felt like giving up.\n\nMr. Sims was an only child\u2014a self-described \u201cgood student and popular kid.\u201d High school was complicated by his parents\u2019 periodic unemployment, financial strains, and related marital difficulties.\n\nHe started drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana in ninth grade, but neither had ever caused him difficulty. At the time of the evaluation, he said he occasionally had a beer or marijuana cigarette at parties, but that he didn\u2019t have the time, money, or inclination to get intoxicated.\n\nOn examination, Mr. Sims was punctual, cooperative, pleasant, attentive, appropriately dressed, and well groomed. He spoke coherently. He appeared generally worried and constricted, but he smiled appropriately several times during the interview. He said he felt bad about his declining grades, but he denied feeling guilty or worthless. He had a quiet, dry sense of humor. He denied current suicidality, homicidality, and psychosis. He was cognitively intact, and his insight and judgment were considered good.",

The rubric emphasizes expert-level data extraction and diagnostic reasoning, but the response must only include the diagnoses without any clinical reasoning.\n\nFirst, I need to extract key clinical details. The patient is a 21-year-old man with a 3-month history of depressed mood following a breakup, but his symptoms are tied to specific stressors\u2014financial worries, academic pressure, and racial discrimination. He has no neurovegetative symptoms like appetite or sleep changes (except when related to his shift work), and he still enjoys socializing. He denies guilt, worthlessness, or suicidality.

She had just been admitted to the medical service for shortness of breath. She was subsequently found to have a unilateral pleural effusion. Ms. Trentino had already been through several rounds of chemotherapy over the prior few months. At the time of the consultation, she was awaiting the results of thoracentesis to assess for pulmonary metastases.\n\nInterviewed separately, Ms. Trentino and her two sons agreed that until this hospitalization, she had never previously been especially depressed or anxious but had instead been the family\u2019s \u201crock.\u201d She had never seen a therapist, taken psychiatric medication, or used alcohol, opiates, or illicit drugs. Her family history was notable for a father who drank to excess, which she described as the reason she had never tasted alcohol.\n\nOn examination, the patient was a well-groomed woman sitting in bed with an oxygen nasal cannula in place, wringing her hands and dabbing at her eyes with a wet tissue. She was cooperative and coherent. She was visibly dysphoric, with a constricted, worried affect. She reported being extremely worried about the pending thoracentesis study. She knew that metastases could mean \u201ca death sentence\u201d and said, \u201cI want to be alive for my son\u2019s marriage this year.\u201d She added tearfully, \u201cI\u2019ve been through so much with the illness already.\u2009\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. When is it going to stop?\u201d\n\nMs. Trentino endorsed poor sleep and impaired concentration since her admission to the hospital 5 days earlier. She had been eating less than usual. She said she was \u201ctoo sad and worried\u201d to do her usual daily crossword. She denied confusion and psychotic symptoms. She appeared cognitively intact, and her Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 29 out of 30, with 1 lost point for incorrect recall of an object after 5 minutes. She adamantly denied suicidal ideation, again speaking of her love for her two children.\n\nMs. Trentino\u2019s vital signs were notable for an oxygen saturation of 94% on room air (corrected to 99% on nasal cannula), and her chest X ray showed a large left-sided pleural effusion. Neurological examination was unremarkable. Her basic lab results were otherwise within normal limits. Collateral information from nursing staff indicated that she rang her call bell frequently throughout the day to ask about medication and test details.\n\nDiscussion with the patient\u2019s family members revealed appropriate concern about their mother\u2019s health, as well as frustration over her psychological state. As one of the sons told the psychiatric consultant, \u201cWe understand this is a stressful time for Mom, but all she does in the hospital is cry all day and keep on asking us the same questions over and over again. She\u2019s usually the pillar of the family, and now she\u2019s needy and pessimistic. Can you do something?\u201d",

The patient is a 65-year-old woman with recurrent lung cancer, presenting with acute emotional distress in a medical setting. \n\nThe key features to note are the acute onset of symptoms following hospitalization, the clear situational trigger (pending thoracentesis results), and the absence of prior psychiatric history. Her symptoms include dysphoria, tearfulness, anxiety about medical prognosis, poor sleep, reduced appetite, and impaired concentration - all temporally linked to the current stressor.\n\nWhat stands out is how her symptoms are directly tied to realistic medical concerns rather than representing a pervasive depressive episode. The cognitive testing shows intact function except for minor recall issues, which could be due to anxiety or medical factors. The frequent reassurance-seeking behavior aligns more with adjustment-related anxiety than a major depressive disorder.\n\nFor differential diagnosis, the primary consideration should be Adjustment Disorder given the clear stressor and disproportionate reaction. Rule out Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition since she has cancer, but the timing suggests adjustment. Generalized Anxiety Disorder is less likely as this appears situational.

    "vignette":"Hannah, a 16-year-old white girl with no past psychiatric history, was brought to the hospital emergency department following an overdose of unknown amounts of sedating medications. Upon arrival, Hannah had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8, indicating severe compromise. She was intubated and admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. After stabilization over several days, she was admitted to an inpatient psychiatric unit. Current regulatory practice mandates suicide screening for all patients; in this case, Hannah screened positive for suicidal ideation, plan, and attempt on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS).\n\nWhile Hannah was intubated, her parents and her best friend agreed that she appeared to have been in her usual good mood until the evening of the overdose. The best friend reported that a different friend had texted Hannah that she had seen Hannah\u2019s boyfriend kissing another girl. Within a couple of hours of reading that text, Hannah was found by her parents, confused and barely arousable. On her desk was a note: \u201cI just want to sleep forever.\u201d The parents immediately called an ambulance.\n\nPsychiatric history was notable for an absence of depression, suicidal ideation, self-injurious behaviors, mania, or psychosis. She had no previous psychiatric contacts, hospitalizations, or psychotherapy. According to her parents and her best friend, Hannah never used cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, or other illicit drugs. She had no legal history\n\nHannah lived with her parents and two younger sisters. Her academic performance as an eleventh grader at a local public school was stellar. She reported that she hoped to be a physician or attorney. Her best friend said she had been cheerful earlier in the day. Family psychiatric history was notable for her mother having an anxiety disorder for which she was prescribed clonazepam and alprazolam. As a late adolescent, the mother had also made two suicide attempts by medication overdose. Her father had chronic back pain from a sports injury, for which he took oxycodone. Extended family history was notable for a paternal uncle with an alcohol use disorder. No one in the extended family had committed suicide.\n\nAfter she was extubated, Hannah said she felt fine, and that the suicidal feelings were completely gone. She also said that she had been doing well until the minute she read about her boyfriend kissing another girl. Hannah denied having any disturbances of mood, anxiety, sleep, appetite, energy, or concentration, either at the time of the evaluation or in the weeks leading up to the overdose. She denied somatic complaints, psychotic features, and any history of self-injury, such as cutting. She denied any history of trauma or substance use. She recalled that the thought to die came \u201cout of the blue,\u201d and that she immediately wrote the suicide note and gathered medications from her parents\u2019 medicine cabinet. In retrospect, she was horrified by the overdose and grateful that she was alive.\n\nHannah continued to deny depression and suicidality throughout her hospitalization. She was discharged to outpatient care within the hospital clinic. No psychotropic medication was prescribed. She was seen weekly for cognitive-behavioral therapy that focused on coping skills when angry or disappointed. After 6 months, Hannah was noted to be doing well and to have been consistently free of suicidal ideation, intent, or behavior. At that point, Hannah, her parents, and the psychologist agreed to end the treatment, with the understanding that she would restart treatment should she experience any trouble coping.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me break down what I need to do here. The user has provided a clinical case vignette about Hannah, a 16-year-old girl who attempted suicide after learning about her boyfriend's infidelity. I need to follow the rubric for data extraction and diagnostic reasoning, aiming for Level 5 in both. But the final output should only be a structured list of the top 5 DSM-5-TR diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes, without any clinical reasoning in the response.\n\nFirst, I'll go through the vignette carefully to extract all relevant information. Hannah is 16, no prior psychiatric history, attempted suicide via medication overdose after a sudden emotional trigger (boyfriend kissing another girl). She had no preceding depressive symptoms, and after stabilization, she denied any ongoing mood disturbances or suicidality. Her recovery was swift with therapy focused on coping skills, and she remained well at 6 months follow-up.\n\nKey points: acute stressor, impulsive attempt, rapid resolution without medication, no prior or subsequent mental health issues. Family history includes mother with anxiety and past suicide attempts, paternal uncle with alcohol use disorder. Hannah had no substance use, trauma, or self-injury history.\n\nNow, considering DSM-5-TR criteria, the primary diagnosis should reflect the acute, stress-related reaction. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood seems fitting because the symptoms emerged after a specific stressor and resolved within 6 months. However, the severity of the attempt might suggest something more acute, like Acute Stress Disorder, but the vignette doesn't mention dissociative or intrusive symptoms typical of ASD. \n\nWait, the attempt was severe, but the emotional response was brief and directly tied to the stressor. The absence of prolonged depressive symptoms rules out Major Depressive Disorder. The impulsive nature and rapid recovery align more with Adjustment Disorder. But since there was a suicide attempt, perhaps it's Adjustment Disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct, given the suicidal behavior.\n\nDifferential diagnoses: Rule out Major Depressive Disorder, but she lacks the required symptoms and duration. Borderline Personality Disorder might be considered due to impulsivity and emotional reactivity, but at 16, personality disorders are cautiously diagnosed, and she lacks other BPD features like fear of abandonment or identity disturbance. PTSD isn't applicable as there's no trauma. Substance Use Disorder isn't relevant. Maybe Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, but she doesn't have persistent irritability or outbursts.\n\nGiven the family history of anxiety and suicide attempts, Anxiety Disorders could be considered, but Hannah herself denies anxiety. The mother's history might suggest a genetic vulnerability, but no direct symptoms in Hannah. The best friend noted she was cheerful before the event, so no prodromal signs.\n\nPrioritizing diagnoses: \n1. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood (F43.21) as primary, given the stressor and emotional response.\n2. Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder (F43.8) could be an alternative if the severity exceeds typical adjustment disorder.\n3. Major Depressive Disorder, single episode (F32.9) is less likely but included due to the attempt, though symptoms don't meet criteria.\n4. Borderline Personality Disorder (F60.3) considered for differential due to impulsivity and emotional lability.\n5. Anxiety Disorder NOS (F41.9) given family history, though Hannah has no symptoms.\n\nWait, the user mentioned top 5 most likely diagnoses, including primary and four secondaries. I need to list them in order of likelihood. The primary should be the most fitting based on the vignette. Adjustment Disorder seems correct. Then maybe Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder for the acute reaction. MDD is a rule-out. BPD is a consideration but less likely. Anxiety disorder due to family history but no personal symptoms. \n\nAlternatively, since the attempt was severe and impulsive, could it be Suicidal Behavior Disorder? But that's not a DSM-5 diagnosis; it's listed as a condition for further study. So maybe not.\n\nRechecking: Hannah had no prior issues, rapid recovery, specific stressor. Adjustment Disorder fits best. Secondary diagnoses should include conditions to rule out or less likely possibilities. Maybe include Unspecified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder, MDD, BPD traits, and Anxiety Disorder NOS. But the user asked for DSM-5-TR diagnoses with F-codes, so I'll stick to those.\n\nFinalizing: \n1. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood (F43.21)\n2. Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder (F43.8)\n3. Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, mild (F32.0) \u2013 though symptoms aren't listed, the attempt might imply it, but it's less likely.\n4. Borderline Personality Disorder (F60.3) \u2013 tentative due to age and limited features.\n5. Anxiety Disorder, Unspecified (F41.9) \u2013 based on family history.\n\nBut the vignette says she had no disturbances in mood, anxiety, etc., before or after, so MDD and anxiety disorders are less supported. Maybe replace MDD with Unspecified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder? Or include both. \n\nGiven the absence of ongoing symptoms, Adjustment Disorder is primary. The others are differentials to consider but less likely. The list should reflect likelihood based on the data. So, Adjustment Disorder, then Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder, then MDD (rule-out), BPD (rule-out), and Anxiety Disorder NOS (family history but no symptoms).\n\nWait, the user said \"based only on the information provided.\" Hannah denies any anxiety, so Anxiety Disorder might not be appropriate. Maybe replace it with Unspecified Mood Disorder? But she has no mood disturbances. Perhaps include Suicidal Behavior Disorder? Not a DSM-5 diagnosis. \n\nMaybe include Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder? She's 16, and DMDD is for children up to 18, but she doesn't have chronic irritability. So no.\n\nConsidering the impulsive attempt and family history of suicide attempts, maybe Substance\/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder? But no substance use. \n\nAnother thought: Could it be Brief Psychotic Disorder? No psychotic features mentioned. \n\nSo, sticking with Adjustment Disorder as primary. Secondaries: Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder, MDD, BPD, and Unspecified Anxiety Disorder. But I should use F-codes properly.\n\nLooking up ICD-10 codes: Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood is F43.21. Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder is F43.8. MDD single episode mild is F32.0. Borderline Personality Disorder is F60.3. Anxiety Disorder Unspecified is F41.9. That seems correct.\n\nBut let's confirm the primary. The vignette emphasizes acute stressor, rapid resolution, no prior issues. Adjustment Disorder is the best fit. The suicide attempt is severe, but the context supports Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood. \n\nYes, that should be the primary. Now, for the response, I'll list them in that order.",

    "vignette":"Isaac Ulysse, a 29-year-old surgery resident at a large urban hospital, was referred to his employee assistance program because of \u201cburnout.\u201d Dr. Ulysse\u2019s supervisors had become concerned about his appearing increasingly distracted and sad. After performing very well at their medical school and during the first 2 years of surgery training, Dr. Ulysse was now manifesting some problems, with his most recent performance review being notable for uncharacteristic sloppiness and lateness. Dr. Ulysse had shrugged off two referrals, but after being told that he was being released from work until he got clearance from psychiatry, he agreed to an evaluation.\n\nDr. Ulysse stated that he was fine, \u201cjust a little burned out.\u201d He\u2019d always prided himself on having more energy than everyone else, but he\u2019d started getting worn down during the COVID-19 pandemic. He said he was sleeping poorly, was always tired, and was having trouble concentrating. After about 20 minutes, he asked if he could leave, that he felt better already. The psychiatrist explained that she would need to meet with him at least a few times before she could allow him to go back to work.\n\nReminded that he wasn\u2019t yet ready to go back to work, Dr. Ulysse appeared to slump in his seat. When the psychiatrist asked him to say more, he replied that he hated being this way, hated being weak.\n\nHe said he knew he had burnout. He\u2019d read up on it, and he felt exhausted, cynical about his being a \u201ccog in the medical-industrial complex,\u201d and less able to finish his daily work. He thought he might also have a depressive disorder, given that he was sad just about every day and also felt tired, worthless, and unable to sleep and concentrate normally. He said this had been going on for 12 or 18 months, but he\u2019d been \u201cgood at hiding things until recently.\u201d Dr. Ulysse asked whether the psychiatrist could diagnose him with burnout, since he\u2019d prefer not to get a label that is a \u201ccareer killer, at least for a surgeon.\u201d He said he would be completely adherent with an antidepressant medication if the psychiatrist would let him go back to work. When asked if he felt suicidal, he responded that he had always thought that was a ridiculous question: \u201cIf you\u2019re really serious about suicide, why tell somebody who has 911 on speed dial? But no, I\u2019m not going to kill myself.\u201d\n\nAt this point, the psychiatrist asked for more background information. Dr. Ulysse was the only child born to a pharmacist and a French professor, who had left Haiti when he was born. He had grown up in a suburban area where he was often the only Black child in his grade. When asked if that was difficult for him, he looked skeptical. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said, \u201cI know all about microaggressions and structural racism, all that stuff, but my strategy was to always be smarter, funnier, nicer, and more athletic than everybody else. I always had a confident smile on my face, and now nothing makes me happy. My nickname at my fancy high school was Superman. I literally dated the homecoming queen, and nobody seemed to mind about the Black\/white thing.\u201d At that point, he laughed and added, \u201cwell, except for my Gran, my dad\u2019s mother, who lived with us when I was growing up. She thought I was asking for trouble.\u201d\n\nAfter a few moments of silence, Dr. Ulysse began to quietly cry. When asked to say more, he explained that his parents worked \u201call the time\u201d when he was young, so his grandmother lived with them and took care of him throughout his school years. She had died of COVID-19 about 18 months earlier. Since then, he described thinking about her \u201call the time\u201d and having become increasingly preoccupied by his failure to convince her to get the COVID vaccine.\n\nHe said he knew it was ridiculous, but he had partially believed her when she had insisted that she was able to protect everyone in the family from the virus. \u201cDid I mention my Gran was a Catholic witch, and a very good one?\u201d Dr. Ulysse added that although he knew she was dead, part of him continued to expect her to walk through the door, and he looked up multiple times every day, expecting her to be there. He spent long hours reviewing his inability to convince her to get the vaccine as well as his decision not to visit her for months for fear of infecting her. He awoke with nightmares most nights. He didn\u2019t remember the content of the dreams very well, but they tended to be about his grandmother disappearing and him being unable to help. He noted that he had become increasingly angry and bitter at colleagues, his parents, and his ex-girlfriend. Since she had moved out of their apartment 6 months earlier, he hadn\u2019t spoken to her or seen any of his friends. His parents called frequently and have tried to \u201ckidnap\u201d him for a weekend with family, but they appear to have gotten frustrated that he was being so stubborn. He said that he was okay watching TV\u2014where he focused on \u201cpestilence and wars\u201d\u2014but he just felt too numb to talk to people. He also stated that he barely knew who he was anymore, and that his job as a surgery trainee had come to seem irrelevant if it meant that he couldn\u2019t even help his family. Although he was definitely not going to kill himself, and he knew the whole idea was \u201cstupid,\u201d he did daydream almost every day about being dead so that he could see his grandmother again.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, the user wants me to act as an expert psychiatrist diagnosing a clinical case. Let me start by carefully reading the vignette and following the rubric provided.\n\nFirst, I need to extract and organize the relevant data. Dr. Isaac Ulysse is a 29-year-old surgery resident showing signs of burnout, but there's more beneath the surface. He mentions symptoms like sadness, fatigue, worthlessness, sleep issues, and poor concentration for 12-18 months. That aligns with major depressive disorder, but the duration suggests a persistent depressive disorder might be considered too.\n\nWait, his grandmother died 18 months ago from COVID-19, and he's experiencing preoccupation with guilt over not convincing her to get vaccinated. He has nightmares about her, anger, social withdrawal, and emotional numbness. These seem like symptoms of prolonged grief disorder or PTSD. He avoids reminders, has intrusive thoughts, and feels detached, which points toward PTSD, especially since the trauma involves her death and his perceived failure.\n\nHe also mentions expecting her to walk in, which could be indicative of complicated grief. The DSM-5-TR includes Prolonged Grief Disorder, so that's a strong candidate. His burnout might be secondary to these underlying issues.\n\nNow, for the differential diagnosis: Primary could be PTSD due to the traumatic loss and associated symptoms. Secondary, Major Depressive Disorder seems likely given the pervasive low mood and anhedonia. Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood might fit given the stressor, but the duration and severity suggest something more chronic.\n\nHe also has traits of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder? No, not really. Maybe no personality disorder here. Substance use isn't mentioned, so rule that out. Anxiety disorders? He has nightmares and hypervigilance, which are part of PTSD. So, PTSD as primary, then MDD, then Prolonged Grief Disorder, Persistent Depressive Disorder, and maybe Adjustment Disorder as less likely.\n\nNeed to ensure ICD-10 codes are correct. PTSD is F43.10, MDD is F33.2 (recurrent, moderate), Prolonged Grief is F43.88, Persistent Depressive Disorder is F34.1, and Adjustment Disorder is F43.23.\n\nPrioritize based on symptom severity and impact. PTSD seems most encompassing of his symptoms, so that's primary. Then MDD, followed by Prolonged Grief, Persistent Depressive, and Adjustment Disorder. Make sure not to include any non-psychiatric diagnoses.",

She reported greater benefit from psychotherapies based on cognitive-behavioral therapy and dialectical behavior therapy. Electroconvulsive therapy had been suggested, but she had refused. She had been hospitalized twice for suicidal ideation and severe self-cutting that required stitches.\n\nMs. Vaughan reported that previous therapists had focused on the likelihood of trauma, but she casually dismissed the possibility that she had ever been abused. It had been her younger sister who had reported \u201cweird sexual touching\u201d by their father when Ms. Vaughan was 13. There had never been a police investigation, but her father had apologized to the patient and her sister as part of a resultant church intervention and an inpatient treatment for alcoholism and \u201csex addiction.\u201d She denied any feelings about these events and said, \u201cHe took care of the problem. I have no reason to be mad at him.\u201d\n\nMs. Vaughan reported little memory for her life between the ages of about 7 and 13 years. Her siblings would joke about her inability to recall family holidays, school events, and vacation trips. She explained her amnesia by saying, \u201cI don\u2019t remember anything because nothing happened.\u201d\n\nShe reported a \u201cgood\u201d relationship with both parents.

On closer questioning, Ms. Vaughan reported that her self-injurious and suicidal behavior primarily occurred after visits to see her family or when her parents surprised her by visiting.\n\nMs. Vaughan described being \u201csocially withdrawn\u201d until high school, at which point she became academically successful and a member of numerous teams and clubs. She did well in college. She excelled at her job and was regarded as a gifted teacher of autistic children. She described several friendships of many years. She reported difficulty with intimacy with men, experiencing intense fear and disgust at any attempted sexual advances. Whenever she did get at all involved with a man, she felt intense shame and a sense of her own \u201cbadness,\u201d although she felt worthless at other times as well. She tended to sleep poorly and often felt tired.\n\nShe denied use of alcohol or drugs. She added that even the smell of alcohol made her feel like throwing up.\n\nOn mental status examination, the patient was well groomed and cooperative. Her responses were coherent and goal directed, but often devoid of emotional content. She appeared sad and constricted. She described herself as \u201cnumb.\u201d She denied hallucinations, confusion, and a current intention to kill herself. However, thoughts of suicide were \u201calways around.\u201d\n\nMore specific questions led Ms. Vaughan to deny that she had ongoing amnesia for daily life, particularly denying ever being told of behavior she could not recall, unexplained possessions, subjective time loss, fugue episodes, or inexplicable fluctuations in skills, habits, and\/or knowledge. She denied a sense of subjective self-division, hallucinations, inner voices, or passive influence symptoms. She denied flashbacks or intrusive memories, but she did report recurrent nightmares of being chased by \u201ca dangerous man\u201d from whom she could not escape. She reported difficulty concentrating, although she was \u201chyperfocused\u201d at work. She reported an intense startle reaction. She said that she often found herself silently counting and singing rather than let herself daydream. She added that she was very careful, checking multiple times every night to ensure that her doors were locked. When she got anxious, she found that rearranging her furniture helped her feel safer.",

I need to extract relevant info and organize it logically, then provide a differential diagnosis with ICD-10 codes.\n\nFirst, looking at the data extraction. The patient is a 29-year-old woman with chronic severe depression, multiple treatment failures including antidepressants and mood stabilizers, but some benefit from CBT and DBT. There's history of self-harm with cutting requiring stitches and two hospitalizations for suicidality. Trauma history is hinted at with her sister reporting sexual touching by their father when she was 13, though she denies abuse. There's reported amnesia for ages 7-13. Self-injury occurs after family visits. She has difficulty with intimacy, feeling shame and worthlessness. Avoids alcohol, has nightmares, startle response, hypervigilance (checking locks), and uses counting\/furniture rearranging to manage anxiety.\n\nOrganizing this: chronic depression with poor treatment response, self-harm, possible trauma history despite denial, dissociative symptoms (amnesia for childhood), relational issues, anxiety symptoms including nightmares and hypervigilance. The emotional numbing, avoidance, and distress around family visits point to trauma-related issues.\n\nNow for diagnostic reasoning. The primary consideration is Complex PTSD or PTSD given the trauma history, nightmares, startle, hypervigilance, emotional numbing, and avoidance. But she denies flashbacks, so maybe PTSD with dissociative features? The amnesia for childhood could indicate dissociative amnesia. The chronic depression is prominent, so Persistent Depressive Disorder might be there. Her self-harm, identity issues (shame, worthlessness), and relationship problems hint at Borderline Personality Disorder. Avoidant Personality Disorder could fit due to social withdrawal and intimacy fears. OCD traits are present with counting and rearranging furniture for anxiety relief.\n\nDifferential: 1. PTSD (chronic, with dissociative symptoms) - F43.10. 2. Persistent Depressive Disorder - F34.1. 3. Borderline Personality Disorder - F60.3. 4. Dissociative Amnesia - F44.0. 5. Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder or traits, but more likely Other Specified Personality Disorder with avoidant and obsessive traits - F60.89.\n\nI should ensure the codes are correct.

    "vignette":"Ken Waldron, a 20-year-old college sophomore, was referred by his resident advisor (RA) to the school\u2019s mental health care clinic after he appeared depressed in the weeks following a breakup with his girlfriend. Mr. Waldron did not attend the evaluation session, telling his RA that \u201ceverybody gets bummed after a breakup\u2014I'll be fine.\u201d When Mr. Waldron seemed \u201cstrange and out of it,\u201d his RA made another appointment and then accompanied Ken to the meeting.\n\nIn that initial session, Mr. Waldron was hesitant but revealed that he had been crushed by the breakup. While he had previously been an excellent student, he\u2019d quit doing homework and just looked out the window during class. He noticed that his grades had declined markedly, but \u201cI don\u2019t seem to care.\u201d Although he said he felt lonely, he also admitted to steadily deleting incoming texts, so that he rarely communicated with his friends and family.\n\nWhen asked to describe other symptoms of depression, Mr. Waldron replied that he didn\u2019t have anything to say. He said that his mind felt blank, \u201cas usual.\u201d He added that he also felt increasingly detached from his physical body, going about his daily activities \u201clike a robot.\u201d He said he felt so disconnected that he often wondered if he were dead or living in a dream, or just had \u201cno self.\u201d\n\nMr. Waldron said that he\u2019d been depressed for a few weeks after the breakup. He said he\u2019d never been in love before and was shocked when Jill told him she needed \u201ctime apart.\u201d For weeks afterward, he felt sad and a little desperate, but he\u2019d continued to see friends and go to class; however, at some point, things began to change. He said he started feeling numb, unreal, and disconnected, but it was all a little fuzzy.\n\nMr. Waldron described a time-limited bout of extreme anxiety in tenth grade. At that time, panic attacks had begun and then escalated in severity and frequency over 2 months. During those attacks, he had felt very detached, as if everything around him was unreal. The symptoms sometimes lasted for several hours and were reminiscent of his current complaints. The onset appeared to coincide with his mother\u2019s entry into a psychiatric hospital. When she was discharged, all of his symptoms cleared rapidly. He did not seek treatment at that time.\n\nMr. Waldron also described experiencing transient feelings of unreality in elementary school, just after his parents divorced and his father left young Jason and his mother, who had a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. His childhood was significant for pervasive loneliness and the sense that he was the only adult in the family. His mother was only marginally functional, with a few actively psychotic episodes. His father rarely visited but did provide enough money for them to continue to live in reasonable comfort. Jason often stayed with his grandparents on weekends, but in general, he and his mother lived a very isolated life. He did well in school and had a few close friends, but he largely kept to himself and rarely brought friends home. Jill would have been the first girlfriend to meet his mother.\n\nMr. Waldron denied using any drugs, in particular cannabis, hallucinogens, or ketamine, and his urine toxicology was negative. Although his home life featured emotional neglect by both parents and emotional abuse when his mother was actively psychotic, he denied physical or sexual abuse. He denied any psychiatric history of mania, psychosis, or other past psychiatric symptoms, except as described above. He also specifically denied amnesia, blackouts, multiple identities, hallucinations, paranoia, and other unusual thoughts or experiences.\n\nResults of routine laboratory tests, a blood toxicology screen, and a physical examination were normal, as were a brain magnetic resonance imaging scan and an electroencephalogram. Consultations with an otorhinolaryngologist and a neurologist were noncontributory.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the vignette to understand Ken's situation. He's a 20-year-old college student referred after a breakup, initially seeming depressed but then showing more complex symptoms.\n\nFirst, I need to extract all relevant clinical data. Ken presents with depressive symptoms like withdrawal from social contacts, neglecting schoolwork, and feeling lonely. But there are key additional features: he describes feeling detached from his body, like a robot, and questions if he's dead or in a dream. These sound like depersonalization\/derealization symptoms. He also mentions past episodes of similar detachment during panic attacks in tenth grade and after his parents' divorce in elementary school.\n\nHis history includes a mother with paranoid schizophrenia, emotional neglect, and isolation during childhood. He denies drug use, which is confirmed by toxicology. Medical workup is normal, ruling out organic causes.\n\nNow, organizing this information: the current episode started after a stressor (breakup), with depressive features but prominent dissociation. Past episodes were stress-related too\u2014mother's hospitalization and parents' divorce. There's a family history of schizophrenia, but Ken denies psychosis. The chronic feelings of unreality since childhood suggest a pattern, not just an acute reaction.\n\nFor diagnostic reasoning, the primary issue seems to be the persistent and recurrent feelings of detachment and unreality. Depersonalization-derealization disorder fits because these symptoms are predominant and cause distress. The depressive symptoms might be secondary or comorbid.\n\nDifferential diagnoses should include conditions with dissociative features. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood is possible given the breakup trigger, but the dissociation is more prominent. Persistent depressive disorder could explain chronic low mood but doesn't fully capture the dissociation. Other specified dissociative disorder might be considered if criteria for depersonalization-derealization aren't fully met. Unspecified trauma disorder is relevant due to childhood neglect and abuse, which could underlie dissociation.\n\nI should ensure each diagnosis aligns with DSM-5-TR criteria and prioritize based on symptom severity and duration.

    "vignette":"Lourdes Zayas, a 33-year-old Puerto Rican woman born in the United States, was brought to the emergency room (ER) after she became distraught and tried to swallow bleach.\n\nThe patient, who had no previous psychiatric history, had apparently been doing fine until the day before, when her fianc\u00e9 was murdered in a drug-related incident in Puerto Rico. Her family reported that Ms. Zayas reacted initially with inordinate calm. Concerned, relatives discreetly followed her around in their small apartment for several hours. She did not speak but instead engaged in repetitive, unnecessary tasks such as folding and unfolding clothes.\n\nThat afternoon, standing at the washing machine, she had cried out, grabbed a bottle of bleach, and tried to drink from it. Her brother knocked it away. She fell to the ground, shaking, screaming, and crying. This episode lasted a few seconds, after which she \u201clay as if dead\u201d for a few minutes. The family recalled no tonic-clonic movements, tongue biting, or loss of sphincter control. When the ambulance arrived, Ms. Zayas was crying softly, repeating the name of her fianc\u00e9, and was generally unresponsive to questions. After medical staff treated mild burns to her lips, she was triaged to the psychiatry department.\n\nOver the next few hours, Ms. Zayas became more responsive. During a clinical interview done in Spanish, she reported being struck \u201cnumb\u201d (insensible) by the news of her fianc\u00e9\u2019s death and described a sense of being disconnected from her body, her emotions, and her surroundings. These symptoms were still present in the ER but diminished over several hours. She also described amnesia for what occurred from the moment when she cried out and her vision went \u201cdark\u201d (oscura), to when she \u201cawoke\u201d in the ER.\n\nWhile being kept under observation for 24 hours, Ms. Zayas had two more episodes of sudden agitation, crying, and screaming, during which she attempted to scratch her face and to leave the room. Because she responded quickly to verbal intervention and reassuring physical contact, she was not given medications or placed in restraints, but was kept on one-to-one observation. Her laboratory test results were unremarkable, as were an electroencephalogram and a lumbar puncture.\n\nOn examination, she was crying softly, her mood was sad, and she said she did not remember making a suicide attempt. She was oriented to time, person, and place; had no psychotic symptoms; and denied current suicidal ideation.\n\nMs. Zayas was transferred to an inpatient psychiatric unit for evaluation. She initially had difficulty falling asleep and had sad, scary dreams about her fianc\u00e9. She denied recalling anything from the hours after she tried to swallow bleach. She made efforts to avoid thinking about her fianc\u00e9 and was disturbed by intrusive recollections of their time together, but she never met DSM-5 criteria for acute stress disorder or major depressive disorder. Her symptoms had improved significantly after 1 week. She took no medications at the hospital and was discharged after 10 days with follow-up to outpatient care. She attended a single appointment 1 month later, at which point she and her family agreed that she was episodically sad about the death of her fianc\u00e9 but essentially back to her normal self. At that point, she was lost to follow-up.",

A note sent ahead revealed that she had been tearful and frustrated at her last medical appointment, and her doctor, who had been struggling to control the patient\u2019s persistent back pain, felt that an evaluation by a psychiatrist might be helpful.\n\nGreeting Ms. Adams in the waiting room, the psychiatrist was struck by both her appearance and her manner: here was a woman with shaggy silver hair and dark sunglasses, seated in a wheelchair, who offered a limp handshake and a plaintive sigh before asking the psychiatrist if he would mind pushing her wheelchair into his office. She was tired from a long commute, and, she explained, \u201cNobody on the street offered to help me out. Can you believe that?\u201d\n\nOnce settled, Ms. Adams stated that she had been suffering from unbearable back pain for the previous 13 months. On the night \u201cthat changed everything,\u201d she had locked herself out of her apartment and, while trying to climb in through a fire escape, had fallen and fractured her pelvis, coccyx, right elbow, and three ribs. Although she did not require surgery, she was bed-bound for 6 weeks and then underwent several months of physical therapy. Daily opioid medication had been only moderately helpful. She had seen \u201ca dozen\u201d doctors of various specialties and tried multiple treatments, including anesthetic injections and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation therapy, but her pain was unrelenting. Throughout this ordeal and for years previously, Ms. Adams smoked cannabis daily, explaining that a joint enjoyed in hourly puffs \u201csoftened\u201d her pain and helped her to relax. She did not drink alcohol or use other illicit drugs.\n\nPrior to the accident, Ms. Adams had worked at a neighborhood salon for more than 20 years. She was proud to have had a large number of devoted clients, and she relished the camaraderie with her colleagues, whom she referred to as \u201cmy real family.\u201d She had been unable to return to work since her accident on account of the pain. \u201cThese doctors keep telling me I\u2019m good to go back to work,\u201d she said with visible anger, \u201cbut they don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going through.\u201d Her voice broke. \u201cThey don\u2019t believe me. They think I\u2019m lying.\u201d\n\nShe added that although friends had initially reached out after the accident, lately they had seemed less sympathetic. She let incoming telephone calls go to voice mail most of the time because she just did not feel up to socializing on account of the pain. In the previous month, she had stopped bathing daily and gotten slack about cleaning her apartment. Without the structure of work, she often found herself up until 5:00 a.m., and pain woke her several times before she finally got out of bed in the afternoon. As for her mood, she said, \u201cI\u2019m so depressed it\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d She often felt hopeless of any possibility of living without pain but denied ever thinking of suicide. She explained that her Catholic faith prevented her from considering taking her own life.\n\nMs. Adams had never seen a psychiatrist before and did not recall ever having felt depressed prior to her accident, although she described a \u201chot temper\u201d as a family trait. She spoke of only one meaningful romantic relationship, many years previously, with a woman who was emotionally abusive. When asked about any legal difficulties, she revealed several arrests for theft in her 20s. She was \u201cin the wrong place at the wrong time,\u201d she said, and was never convicted of a crime.",

She had been generally healthy, other than binge eating and obesity, until a year earlier and had undergone gastric bypass surgery 6 years earlier.\n\nAs she entered the consulting room, Ms. Balaban handed the psychiatrist a three-page summary of her physical concerns. Nocturnal leg spasms and daytime leg aches had been her initial concerns. She then developed sleep difficulties that led to \u201cbrain fog\u201d and head heaviness. She had intermittent cold sensations in her extremities, face, ears, eyes, and nasal passages. Pulsating sensations in her eyes were, she thought, more pronounced after a poor night\u2019s sleep. In recent months, she had developed difficulty urinating, menstrual irregularity, and multiple muscle complaints, including right gluteal pain with a burning sensation into her right thigh. She also had neck stiffness with accompanying thoracic back spasms.\n\nMs. Balaban\u2019s primary care physician had evaluated the initial symptoms and then referred her to a rheumatologist and a neurologist. The rheumatologist diagnosed mechanical back pain without evidence of inflammatory arthritis. She had also diagnosed possible migraines with peripheral neuropathic and ocular symptoms. The neurologist noted that Ms. Balaban was also being evaluated by a neurologist and a neuro-ophthalmologist at a nearby medical center. The other neurologist concluded her evaluation with a provisional diagnosis of \u201catypical migraine variant,\u201d noting that \u201cthe patient seemed to also have a significant degree of depression, which might be aggravating the symptoms or even be an underlying precipitating factor.\u201d A review of tests done at the two medical centers indicated that Ms. Balaban had received the following essentially normal tests: two electroencephalograms, an electromyogram, three brain and three spinal magnetic resonance images, two lumbar puncture studies, and serial laboratory exams. Psychiatric consultation had been recommended, but the patient declined until repeatedly urged by her primary care physician.\n\nMs. Balaban initially spoke to the psychiatrist primarily about her physical complaints. She was very frustrated that despite having seen several specialists, she had received no clear diagnosis, and she was still very concerned about her symptoms. She had started taking fluoxetine and gabapentin, prescribed by her primary care physician, and experienced partial improvement in her mood and some of her pains. She found it difficult to concentrate and complete her work and was spending a lot of time on the internet researching her symptoms. For the past several months, she had kept a spreadsheet that tried to link her symptoms to her blood pressure and pulse.\n\nShe also felt bad about not spending enough time with her children or husband, but just did not have the energy. She acknowledged bouts of depressed mood over the prior year with some anhedonia and occasional thoughts of suicide (she had considered crashing her car), but no anorexia or guilt. She described having experienced premenstrual depressive symptoms for about a year.\n\nMs. Balaban had been treated for postpartum depression 6 years earlier after the birth of her second child. Family history was significant for cancer, depression, and hypertension.\n\nMs. Balaban lived with her husband and their daughters, ages 10 and 6 years. Her husband was being treated for depression. The patient had graduated from college and was the longtime administrative assistant to a dean at the local university. She grew up in a small town in a rural area. She reported a happy childhood and denied any experiences of physical or sexual abuse. There was no history of a substance use disorder.\n\nOn mental status examination, the patient was alert, casually but neatly dressed, cooperative, and not at all defensive.

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, the user wants me to act as an expert psychiatrist diagnosing a clinical case vignette. Let me start by carefully reading the vignette to extract all relevant details. The patient, Norma Balaban, is a 37-year-old woman with multiple somatic symptoms, depression, and a history of gastric bypass surgery. She\u2019s been evaluated by several specialists, but tests are normal.\n\nFirst, I need to follow the rubric for Data Extraction and Organization at Level 5. That means identifying subtle cues and patterns. Her somatic symptoms are diverse\u2014leg spasms, brain fog, cold sensations, urinary issues, menstrual irregularities, muscle pain. She\u2019s extensively documented these, even keeping a spreadsheet. That\u2019s a key clue. She\u2019s focused on physical complaints despite normal test results, which suggests a possible somatic symptom disorder.\n\nNext, Diagnostic Reasoning and Differential Diagnosis at Level 5 requires a nuanced differential. Her depressed mood, anhedonia, suicidal thoughts, and psychomotor retardation point to a major depressive episode. The postpartum depression history adds weight. But the somatic symptoms are excessive and disproportionate to any medical findings, aligning with somatic symptom disorder. The preoccupation with symptoms and time spent researching them fits illness anxiety disorder, though the DSM-5-TR might categorize it under somatic symptom disorder with predominant preoccupation.\n\nAlso, she has premenstrual dysphoric disorder symptoms for a year, which is separate. The binge eating and obesity history, plus gastric bypass, suggest binge-eating disorder, though post-surgery, it might be in remission or adjusted. Other considerations include adjustment disorder with depressed mood, but the duration and severity lean more towards MDD. Rule out factitious disorder or conversion disorder, but there\u2019s no evidence of intentional symptom production.\n\nNow, prioritize the primary diagnosis. The somatic symptoms are the presenting issue, and they\u2019re severe enough to impair her functioning. So somatic symptom disorder as primary. Then major depressive disorder as secondary due to clear depressive episodes. PMDD is distinct and recurring. Illness anxiety disorder if the preoccupation is separate from somatic symptoms, but in DSM-5-TR, it might be subsumed. Binge-eating disorder is historical but relevant. Avoid non-psychiatric diagnoses.\n\nCheck ICD-10 codes: somatic symptom disorder is F45.1, MDD single episode F32.9 (since no specifics), PMDD N94.3 but that\u2019s not an F-code, wait\u2014PMDD is in DSM-5-TR with code F32.81, actually it\u2019s F32.81 for depressive disorder with peripartum onset? No, PMDD is F32.81? Let me confirm. In ICD-10, PMDD is classified under F32.81 as Premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Binge-eating disorder is F50.81. Illness anxiety disorder is F45.21.\n\nEnsure the top five are psychiatric only. So: 1. Somatic symptom disorder, 2. Major depressive disorder, 3. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder, 4. Illness anxiety disorder, 5. Binge-eating disorder. But wait, the user said top five most likely, including primary and four secondary. The vignette mentions partial improvement with fluoxetine and gabapentin, which supports MDD and somatic symptoms. She also has a family history of depression, which reinforces MDD.\n\nDouble-check if any other disorders fit. Adjustment disorder? The symptoms have lasted over a year, so MDD is more likely. PTSD? No trauma history. OCD? She\u2019s preoccupied with symptoms but no rituals. Generalized anxiety? Not mentioned. So the list seems solid.\n\nFormat as requested: primary diagnosis first, then secondaries with F-codes. Don\u2019t include reasoning in the output. Just the structured list. Let me list them in order of clinical priority based on the vignette.",

He first saw Mr. Capek for a panic attack. It resolved with surprisingly small doses of clonazepam. After that, however, Mr. Capek continued to see him for help coping with his chronic illness. Initially a graduate student pursuing a master\u2019s degree in accounting, Mr. Capek dropped out of school over worries that the demands of his studies would exacerbate his disease. Since that time, his wife, a registered nurse, had been his primary support. He supplemented their income with small accounting jobs but limited these lest the stress affect his health.\n\nMr. Capek usually felt physically and emotionally well. He deemed his occasional fatigue, anxiety, and concentration difficulties \u201ccontrollable\u201d and did not require treatment. Mr. Capek was typically averse to psychotropic medications and took a homeopathic approach to his disease, including exercise and proper nutrition. When his panic symptoms would reemerge, he used small doses (e.g., one-quarter of a 0.5-mg lorazepam pill). His psychiatric sessions were commonly concerned about his underlying disease; he often brought articles on chronic Lyme disease for discussion and was active in a local Lyme disease support group.\n\nMr. Capek\u2019s symptoms would occasionally worsen. However, these worsenings occurred less than yearly, and these \u201cexacerbations\u201d usually related to some apparent stress. The worst episode had been 1 year earlier, when his wife briefly left him following his revelation of an affair. Mr. Capek expressed shame about his behavior toward his wife\u2014both the affair and his inability to support her. He subsequently cut off contact with the other woman and attempted to expand his accounting work. The psychiatrist speculated that similar stress was behind his current symptoms.\n\nThe psychiatrist communicated regularly with Mr. Capek\u2019s internist. His Lyme disease tests had thus far been negative. When the internist reported this, Mr. Capek became defensive and produced literature on the inaccuracy of Lyme disease testing. Eventually, the internist and the psychiatrist agreed on a conservative treatment approach with a neutral stance regarding the disease\u2019s validity.\n\nOn examination, Mr. Capek was a healthy, well-developed adult male. He was anxious and spoke quietly with his eyes closed. He frequently lost his train of thought, but with encouragement and patience, he could give a detailed history consistent with the psychiatrist\u2019s account. Physical examination findings were unremarkable, and a standard laboratory screen was normal except for a slightly low hemoglobin value. The medical team chose to defer further Lyme testing, given the patient\u2019s many past negative tests. However, on hearing about the low hemoglobin, Mr. Capek became alarmed, dismissed reassurances, and insisted that the team investigate this further.",

The user wants a diagnosis based on DSM-5-TR criteria, following a specific rubric and format. \n\nFirst, I need to extract key information from the vignette. The patient has a 20-year history of preoccupation with Lyme disease despite negative tests, which has significantly impacted his life (dropping out of school, limiting work). He shows illness anxiety with minimal somatic symptoms and excessive health-related behaviors. There's also mention of panic attacks treated with benzodiazepines and relationship stress triggering exacerbations.\n\nFor diagnostic reasoning, the primary consideration is illness anxiety disorder given the chronic preoccupation with having a serious illness despite medical reassurance. The differential should include somatic symptom disorder, but the focus here is more on fear of having Lyme disease rather than distress about symptoms themselves. Panic disorder is relevant given the history of panic attacks. Adjustment disorder might explain the stress-related exacerbations.

    "vignette":"Paulina Delcampo, a 32-year-old single woman with epilepsy that was first diagnosed during adolescence, was admitted to an academic medical center after her family found her convulsing in her bedroom. Before she was taken to the emergency room (ER), emergency medical services administered several doses of lorazepam, with no change in her condition. On arrival at the ER, a loading dose of fosphenytoin was administered to her; it stopped the convulsive activity. Blood tests obtained in the ER revealed therapeutic levels of her usual antiepileptics and no evidence of any infection or metabolic disturbance. Urine toxicology screens were negative for the use of illicit substances. Ms. Delcampo was admitted to the neurology service for further monitoring.\n\nDuring her admission, a routine electroencephalogram (EEG) was ordered. Shortly after the study began, Ms. Delcampo began convulsing; this prompted administration of intravenous (IV) lorazepam. When the EEG was reviewed, no epileptiform activity was identified. Ms. Delcampo was placed on video-EEG (vEEG) monitoring, and her antiepileptics were tapered and discontinued. In the course of her monitoring, Ms. Delcampo had several episodes of convulsive motor activity; however, none was associated with epileptiform activity on the EEG. Psychiatric consultation was requested.\n\nOn interview, Ms. Delcampo denied prior psychiatric evaluations, diagnoses, or treatments. She denied having depressed mood or any disturbance of sleep, energy, concentration, or appetite. She reported no thoughts of harming herself or others. She endorsed no signs or symptoms consistent with mania or psychosis. There was no family history of psychiatric illness or substance abuse. Her examination revealed a well-groomed woman, sitting on her hospital bed with EEG leads in place. She was pleasant and engaged, and she made good eye contact. Cognitive testing revealed no deficits.\n\nMs. Delcampo noted that she had recently moved to the state to begin graduate school; she was excited about starting her studies and \u201cfinally getting my career on track.\u201d She denied any recent specific psychosocial stressors other than her move and said, \u201cMy life is finally where I want it to be.\u201d She was future oriented and concerned about the impact that her seizures might have on her long-term health. She was worried that a protracted hospitalization might cause her to miss the first day of classes (only a week away from the time of the interview). Moreover, she was quite concerned about the costs of her hospitalization because her health insurance coverage did not begin until the school semester commenced and the payment for extended benefits coverage from her previous employer would have a significant impact on her budget.\n\nWhen the findings of the vEEG study were discussed with Ms. Delcampo, she quickly became quite irritable, asking, \u201cSo, everyone thinks I\u2019m just making this up?\u201d She was not calmed by her treaters\u2019 attempts to clarify that they did not believe her to be faking her symptoms or by their reassurance that her symptoms might be helped by structured therapy.

    "vignette":"A hospital-based psychiatric consultation-liaison service was called to assess possible depression in Rebecca Ehrlich, a 24-year-old woman who had been hospitalized 2 days earlier for severe abdominal pain. She had been admitted through the emergency room for the latest flare-up of her underlying Crohn\u2019s disease. The consultation was called after the nurses became concerned that she was sad and lonely and was having a difficult time adjusting to her medical condition.\n\nMs. Ehrlich was interviewed by the medical student on the psychiatry service. The patient indicated that the pain was excruciating and that she was neither sad nor lonely but was simply visiting from out of town, so no one knew she was even in the hospital. She told the medical student that her only previous therapy had been in college, when she went to student health services to get help for anxiety about test taking and her career choice. She had successfully completed a short course of cognitive-behavioral therapy, and the anxiety had not reappeared. She denied any other psychiatric history and had never taken psychiatric medication. In college, she studied psychology and worked part-time as a hospital orderly. Ms. Ehrlich had considered a career in medicine or nursing and asked the student how he had decided to go to medical school.\n\nMs. Ehrlich reported that she had previously worked regularly and had \u201cquite a few friends,\u201d but that the recurrent abdominal pain had wrecked her social life and her job prospects. She had lost a job the year before because of absenteeism and had missed several job interviews due to her Crohn\u2019s flares. She had dated as a teenager but had been in no relationships since starting college. These things \u201cwere not the end of the world, but how would you feel?\u201d As a member of an online bowel disorders support group, Ms. Ehrlich e-mailed other members on a daily basis. She added that the only person in the family who \u201cgot\u201d her was an aunt who also had Crohn\u2019s disease.\n\nThe primary medical team was having difficulty obtaining collateral information from previous physicians, but the medical student was able to contact Ms. Ehrlich\u2019s mother. She did not know the exact names or phone numbers of her daughter\u2019s medical providers but did recall some of the hospitals and could recall, approximately, some of the physicians\u2019 names. She added that her daughter had not wanted her to be involved in her care and had not told her she was out of town, much less that she was in the hospital. She did say that the Crohn\u2019s disease had been diagnosed 2 years earlier, during her daughter\u2019s last semester of college. The mother estimated that Ms. Ehrlich had been hospitalized at least six times, in contrast with the daughter\u2019s report of two earlier hospitalizations. Neither the gastrointestinal (GI) team nor the medical student was able to locate Ms. Ehrlich\u2019s primary gastroenterologist, whose name the patient could spell only phonetically.\n\nOn examination, Ms. Ehrlich was cooperative and conversant, and appeared comfortable. Her speech was fluent. She appeared calm and unworried about her upcoming procedures. Her thought process was linear. She denied paranoia, hallucinations, or suicidality. Attention and both recent and remote memory were intact. She acknowledged that it had been difficult living with Crohn\u2019s disease, but she was optimistic that her symptoms would improve. She denied depressive symptoms. She looked sad at the beginning of the interview, but she appeared more engaged and euthymic the more she talked. She could not explain why the team was unable to locate her doctor and became irritated when the medical student pressed more specifically to elicit further details about her prior care. She was taken to have an endoscopy and a colonoscopy at the end of the interview.\n\nMs. Ehrlich\u2019s endoscopy and colonoscopy results were normal. That evening, the medical student from psychiatry sat in with the GI team as they reviewed the normal results with the patient. She said she was relieved there was no longer anything seriously wrong with her. The GI team told her that she could be discharged the next morning and that she should have her internist call them. She readily agreed.\n\nAfter the GI team left, Ms. Ehrlich told the student that she was \u201cfeeling better already.\u201d She quickly removed her own intravenous line and started to get dressed. The student went to get the primary GI team. When they returned, the patient was gone.\n\nThe medical student spent much of the next day calling hospitals and physicians that met descriptions provided by the patient and her mother. That afternoon, one of the physicians called back and indicated that he had treated Ms. Ehrlich 6 months earlier at a hospital near her mother\u2019s home. That admission was strikingly similar: after a short hospitalization, she quickly fled from the hospital after a normal colonoscopy.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the clinical vignette about Rebecca Ehrlich. The key points are that she's a 24-year-old woman hospitalized for severe abdominal pain due to Crohn's disease, but the psychiatry consult was called because nurses were concerned about depression. However, during the interview, she denies feeling sad or lonely, instead attributing her appearance to being away from home without visitors.\n\nHmm, she mentions past anxiety in college treated with CBT, no psychiatric meds, and works in healthcare-related fields. She's articulate, cooperative, and her mental status exam shows linear thought, no psychosis, intact memory, but she becomes irritated when pressed about her medical history. The big red flag is the discrepancy in hospitalization history\u2014she says two, her mother says six. Also, her gastroenterologist can't be located, and she spells the name phonetically.\n\nWait, the colonoscopy and endoscopy are normal, which is surprising for active Crohn's flare. Then she leaves abruptly after removing her IV. The kicker is the callback from another doctor describing a similar incident six months earlier\u2014fleeing after normal results. This pattern of seeking hospitalizations, discrepancies in history, and elopement after negative tests points towards factitious disorder.\n\nBut let me consider other possibilities. Could it be somatic symptom disorder? She reports severe pain, but the normal results and pattern suggest exaggeration. Illness anxiety disorder? She doesn't seem preoccupied with having a serious illness, more focused on the medical attention. Malingering? She's not seeking obvious external rewards like disability benefits. Borderline personality disorder might explain the instability and frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, but the core issue here seems to be feigning illness.\n\nThe fact that she's in healthcare (orderly, psychology background) and familiar with medical settings supports factitious disorder. Also, her calm demeanor despite \"excruciating\" pain is suspicious. The mother's collateral adds credibility to the pattern. So primary diagnosis is factitious disorder imposed on self. Secondary could be adjustment disorder due to Crohn's, but she denies depression. Maybe unspecified anxiety disorder from past, but it was resolved. Other differentials include other specified somatic symptom disorder or even borderline traits, but factitious disorder fits best.\n\nNeed to ensure the DSM-5-TR codes are accurate. Factitious disorder is F68.10. For others, adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood if considering her stressors, but she denies symptoms. Maybe unspecified anxiety disorder F41.9 for past issues. Also, rule out Crohn's as a medical condition, but that's not psychiatric. So the list should prioritize factitious disorder, then consider other possibilities like somatic symptom disorder or personality traits.\n\nThe formatting requires top five diagnoses with F-codes. Primary is factitious disorder. Secondary could be somatic symptom disorder, illness anxiety disorder, adjustment disorder, and unspecified anxiety disorder. But need to base on vignette\u2014she doesn't show preoccupation with illness, so illness anxiety might not fit. Adjustment disorder possible due to Crohn's impact on her life, but she's optimistic. So perhaps include other specified somatic symptom disorder, borderline personality traits as other specified personality disorder, and past anxiety disorder. Wait, she had anxiety in college, so other specified anxiety disorder could be listed.\n\nLet me double-check: She denies depressive symptoms, so no major depressive disorder. No psychosis. The key is the deceptive behavior and hospitalizations. Yes, factitious disorder is most likely. Others are less supported but plausible alternatives. So the structured list should start with factitious disorder, then somatic symptom disorder, adjustment disorder, other specified anxiety disorder, and other specified personality disorder.",

    "vignette":"Thomas, an 8-year-old boy with a mild to moderate intellectual developmental disorder, was brought into the emergency room (ER) by his parents after his abdominal pain of the past several weeks had worsened over the prior 24 hours. His parents reported that he had developed constipation, with only one bowel movement in the past week, and that he had vomited earlier in the day. Teachers at his special education classroom for children with intellectual developmental disorders had written a report earlier in the week indicating that Thomas had been having difficulties since soon after transferring from a similar school in a different state about 4 months earlier. The teachers and parents agreed that Thomas often looked distressed, rocking, crying, and clutching his stomach.\n\nOne week earlier, a pediatrician had diagnosed an acute exacerbation of chronic constipation. Use of a recommended over-the-counter laxative was not helpful, and Thomas began to complain of nighttime pain. The discomfort led to a diminished interest in his favorite hobbies, which were video games and sports. Instead, he tended to stay in his room, playing with army men figurines that he had inherited from his grandfather\u2019s collection. Aside from episodes of irritability and tearfulness, he was generally doing well in school, both in the classroom and on the playground. When not complaining of stomachaches, Thomas ate well and maintained his position at about the 40th percentile for height and weight on the growth curve.\n\nThomas\u2019s past medical history was significant for constipation and stomachaches, as well as for intermittent headaches. All of these symptoms had worsened several months earlier, after the family moved from a house in semirural Florida into an old walk-up apartment in a large urban city in a different state. He shared a room with his younger brother (age 6 years), the product of a normal, unexpected pregnancy, who was enrolled in a regular education class at the local public school. Thomas said his brother was his \u201cbest friend.\u201d Thomas was adopted at birth, and nothing was known of his biological parents except that they were teenagers unable to care for the child.\n\nOn medical examination in the ER, Thomas was a well-groomed boy sitting on his mother\u2019s lap. He was crying and irritable and refused to speak to the examiner. Instead, he would repeat to his parents that his stomach hurt. On physical examination, he was afebrile and had stable vital signs. His physical examination was remarkable only for general abdominal tenderness, although he was difficult to assess because he cried uncontrollably through most of the exam.\n\nAn abdominal X ray revealed multiple small metallic particles throughout the gastrointestinal tract, initially suspected to be ingested high-lead paint flakes, as well as three 2-centimeter-long metallic objects in his stomach. A blood lead level was 20 \u03bcg\/dL (whereas normal level for children is <\u20095 \u03bcg\/dL). More specific questioning revealed that Thomas, being constipated, often spent long stretches on the toilet by himself. His parents added that although the bathroom was in the process of being renovated, its paint was old and peeling. Consultants decided that the larger foreign bodies in the stomach might not safely pass and could be accounting for the constipation. Endoscopy successfully extricated three antique toy soldiers from Thomas\u2019s stomach.",

The psychiatrist had been treating Uma for perfectionistic traits that caused her significant anxiety. Their sessions focused on anxiety, not on eating behavior.\n\nUma\u2019s eating difficulties started at age 9, when she began refusing to eat and reporting a fear that she would vomit. At that time, her parents sought treatment from a pediatrician, who continued to evaluate her yearly, explaining that it was normal for children to go through phases. At age 9, Uma was above the 25th percentile for both height and weight (52 inches, 58 pounds), but by age 11, she had essentially stopped growing and had dropped to the 5th percentile on her growth curves (52.5 inches, 55 pounds).\n\nThe only child of two professional parents who had divorced 5 years earlier, Uma lived with her mother on weekdays and with her nearby father on weekends. Her medical history was significant for her premature birth at 34 weeks\u2019 gestation. She was slow to achieve her initial milestones but by age 2 was developmentally normal. Yearly physical examinations had been unremarkable with the exception of the recent decline of her growth trajectory. Uma had always been petite, but her height and weight had never fallen below the 25th percentile for stature and weight for age on the growth chart. Uma was a talented student who was well liked by her teachers. She had never had more than a few friends, but recently she had stopped socializing entirely and had been coming directly home after school, reporting that her stomach felt calmer when she was in her own home.\n\nFor the prior 2 years, Uma had eaten only very small amounts of food over very long durations of time. Her parents had tried to pique her interest by experimenting with foods from different cultures and of different colors and textures. None of this seemed effective in improving her appetite. They also tried to let her pick restaurants to try, but Uma had gradually refused to eat outside of either parent\u2019s home. Both parents reported a similar mealtime pattern: Uma would agree to sit at the table but then spent her time rearranging food on her plate, cutting food items into small pieces, and crying if urged to eat another bite.\n\nWhen asked more about her fear of vomiting, Uma remembered one incident, at age 4, when she ate soup and her stomach became upset and then she subsequently vomited. More recently, Uma had developed fear of eating in public and ate no food during the school day. She denied any concerns about her appearance and said that she had first become aware of her low weight at her most recent visit to the pediatrician.

She reported that she needed to improve her diet and exercise but felt out of control. She added that she had gone to her internist several times in recent months for stomachaches, and he finally insisted that she see a psychiatrist.\n\nMs. Hoffman had been living alone since her college graduation 2 years earlier. She had recently been promoted in her job as an accountant, and said that she enjoyed her work. She mentioned having some friends from high school and being interested in dating, but she felt too tired and sad to do much besides meet up for a quick dinner after work. She was unable to exercise because of low energy, slept poorly, and frequently had stomachaches. These symptoms and the resulting social dysfunction had caused her to feel increasingly isolated, lonely, and sad. She often found herself feeling worthless and wondering how she was going to get through the week, but she denied suicidal intent or plan.\n\nShe said she had accepted the psychiatric referral so that she could get an antidepressant medication, but \u201cit had to be one that didn\u2019t cause weight gain. Hopefully, I could get one that would cause weight loss, instead.\u201d Ms. Hoffman added that she couldn\u2019t get back to her ideal weight despite lots of effort.

She said her downfall really began when she started \u201cstress eating\u201d in college. When she realized she had gained 10 or 15 pounds, she began to routinely skip breakfast. She often skipped lunch as well, but then, famished, she would overeat in the late afternoon and evening.\n\nBy the end of her sophomore year, Ms. Hoffman had started inducing vomiting, a practice she learned about in a magazine. She had developed her current eating pattern during her junior year and continued it after graduation: no breakfast; a \u201clight\u201d lunch; an \u201caverage\u201d dinner, often with friends; and then she\u2019d rush back to her apartment for a second dinner and a pint or two of ice cream, followed by self-induced vomiting.",

The patient reports chronic low mood, anhedonia, fatigue, sleep disturbance, feelings of worthlessness, and social isolation over two years - meeting criteria for a depressive disorder.

    "vignette":"Yasmine Isherwood, a 55-year-old married woman, had been in psychiatric treatment for 6 months for an episode of major depressive disorder. She had responded well to a combination of psychotherapy and medications (fluoxetine and bupropion), but she began to complain of weight gain. She was at her \u201chighest weight ever,\u201d which was 140 pounds (her height was 5 feet 5 inches, so her BMI was 23.3).\n\nThe psychiatrist embarked on a clarification of Ms. Isherwood\u2019s eating history, which was marked by recurrent, distressing episodes of uncontrollable eating of large amounts of food. The overeating was not new but seemed to have worsened while she was taking antidepressants. She reported that she often worked late in her job as marketing director for a large software company, and that the eating episodes often occurred on one of 2 days per week that she happened to get home before her husband, a cardiologist at a local hospital. These \u201ceating jags\u201d were notable for a sense that she was out of control. She ate rapidly and alone, until uncomfortably full. She would then feel depressed, tired, and disgusted with herself. She usually binged on healthy food but also had \u201csugar binges\u201d where she ate primarily sweets, especially ice cream and candy. She denied current or past self-induced vomiting, fasting, or misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or weight-loss agents. She reported exercising for an hour almost every day but denied being \u201caddicted\u201d to it. She did report that in her late 20s, she had become a competitive runner. At that time, she ran an average of about 35 miles per week, despite a lingering foot injury that eventually forced her to shift to swimming, biking, and the elliptical machine.\n\nMs. Isherwood stated that she had binged on food \u201cfor as long as I can remember.\u201d She was \u201cchunky\u201d as a child but stayed at a normal weight throughout high school (120\u2013125 pounds) because she was so active. She denied a history of anorexia nervosa. At age 28, when she was competitively running, she reached her lowest adult weight of 113 pounds. At that point, she felt \u201cvital, healthy, and in control.\u201d\n\nIn her mid-30s, she had a major depressive episode that lasted 2 years. She had a severely depressed mood, did not talk, \u201cclosed down,\u201d stayed in bed, was very fatigued, slept more than usual, and was unable to function. This was one of the few times in her life that the binge eating stopped and she lost weight. She denied a history of hypomanic or manic episodes. Although she lived with frequent sadness, she denied other serious depressive episodes until the past year. She denied a history of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and any significant use of alcohol, tobacco, or illicit substances.\n\nThe evaluation revealed a well-nourished, well-developed female who was coherent and cooperative. Her speech was fluent and not pressured. She had a mildly depressed mood but had a reactive affect with appropriate smiles. She denied guilt, suicidality, and hopelessness. She said her energy was normal except for post-binge fatigue. She denied psychosis and confusion. Her cognition was normal. Her medical history was unremarkable, and physical examination and basic laboratory test results provided by her internist were within normal limits.",

    "model_thoughts":"Hmm, this is a complex clinical vignette requiring careful diagnostic reasoning. The patient has a history of major depressive disorder but presents with longstanding binge eating behaviors that worsened on antidepressants. \n\nOkay, let me systematically extract key data. The patient meets DSM-5 criteria for binge-eating disorder: recurrent binge episodes with loss of control, eating until uncomfortably full, eating alone due to embarrassment, and marked distress. The binge eating predates antidepressant use. The absence of compensatory behaviors rules out bulimia nervosa.\n\nThe history shows recurrent major depressive episodes with current mild depressive symptoms, so persistent depressive disorder needs consideration given the \"frequent sadness.\" The competitive running history with weight of 113 pounds at BMI 18.8 doesn't meet anorexia nervosa criteria since no reported fear of weight gain or body image disturbance.\n\nThe binge eating appears independent of mood episodes, as it stopped during one severe depressive episode. No substance use or medical causes noted. The patient's normal weight and absence of purging further support binge-eating disorder as primary.\n\nFor differential, other specified feeding\/eating disorder could apply if binge frequency is below weekly threshold, but vignette suggests it's recurrent.

    "vignette":"Zack was an 8-year-old boy brought to the outpatient child psychiatry clinic by his mother because of increasing tantrums and somatic complaints without an apparent cause. The mother reported that the symptoms appeared related to the nights that he spent with his aunt, another single mom with a boy similar in age to Zack. He had been close to this aunt since birth but had only recently begun to spend every Friday night with her when the mother took on a night shift at work.\n\nFor 2 months prior to the consultation, Zack would report nausea and headaches on Fridays and complain that his aunt\u2019s house was \u201ccreepy.\u201d He continued to visit, with reluctance, although he did once call his mother at work demanding that she pick him up, saying, \u201cOther kids live in their own home every day of the week.\u201d\n\nIn recent weeks, Zack screamed and hid when it came time to go to his aunt\u2019s home. His mother became concerned that something could have \u201chappened\u201d to Zack during a visit. The mother struggled to reconcile this with the fact that Zack had no objections to seeing the aunt and cousin anywhere else, and he had no objection to the cousin sleeping at their home. Her sister had always been \u201ca good mom\u201d and was always home during the sleepovers. She did have a boyfriend, but Zack seemed to like him. In fact, Zack seemed especially excited to go to the park or ball games with his cousin and the boyfriend.\n\nZack had never previously had particularly significant separation, behavioral, or emotional issues. He achieved all developmental milestones on time. He had never seen a doctor aside from routine visits and one bad cold when he was age 3. Zack had yet to achieve consistent overnight continence, however, and did wet the bed approximately twice weekly. He had no daytime voiding symptoms or constipation. The pediatrician had told them that this was \u201cnormal\u201d at Zack\u2019s age. The mother had never made a big deal about the bed-wetting, and Zack had never expressed significant distress about it.\n\nFamily history was negative for all psychiatric illness on the mother\u2019s side, and the mother said her own developmental landmarks were normal as far as she had been told. The mother knew little about Zack\u2019s father\u2019s developmental or family history, and she had not seen him since before Zack was born.\n\nOn mental status examination, Zack was cooperative and appeared well nourished and well cared for. He had little difficulty separating from his mother. After an initial period of warming up to the interviewer, his speech was spontaneous with a vocabulary appropriate for his age. He maintained age-appropriate eye contact. His affect was initially mildly anxious, but he rapidly calmed. Anxiety only reappeared upon discussing his sleepovers, when Zack demonstrated some fidgeting, decreased eye contact, and mild irritability directed toward his mother. When asked about the bed-wetting, Zack appeared embarrassed. He said he had wet the bed at his aunt\u2019s house a few times and that both his cousin and his aunt\u2019s boyfriend teased him about it. His aunt had intervened, but he described being \u201cscared\u201d that he would do it again.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let's start by carefully reading the clinical vignette about Zack. The key points are that he's an 8-year-old boy with increasing tantrums and somatic complaints linked to Friday night sleepovers at his aunt's house. He reports nausea and headaches on Fridays, calls the aunt's house \"creepy,\" and has recently started screaming and hiding when it's time to go. However, he's fine seeing the aunt and cousin elsewhere, and even enjoys outings with the cousin and the aunt's boyfriend. \n\nThe mother is concerned something might have happened during a visit, but there's no direct evidence of abuse. Zack has bed-wetting issues (twice a week), which is noted as developmentally normal, but he's embarrassed about it. During the mental status exam, he becomes anxious when discussing sleepovers and admits that he wet the bed at his aunt's house and was teased by his cousin and the boyfriend, though the aunt intervened. \n\nNow, I need to extract and organize the relevant data. The symptoms are clearly tied to separation from his mother on specific nights, with anticipatory anxiety (somatic complaints before the sleepovers), reluctance to go, and distress during the separation. The bed-wetting is a factor but seems secondary to the anxiety about sleepovers, especially since he's teased about it there. \n\nFor diagnostic reasoning, the primary issue appears to be anxiety related to separation. The DSM-5 criteria for Separation Anxiety Disorder include developmentally inappropriate and excessive fear or anxiety concerning separation from attachment figures, as evidenced by at least three symptoms like distress when anticipating or experiencing separation, worry about losing attachment figures, reluctance to go out or sleep away from home, nightmares about separation, and physical symptoms when separation occurs. Zack shows several of these: somatic complaints (nausea, headaches) before separation, screaming and hiding when it's time to go, and distress during the sleepovers (calling his mother to pick him up). \n\nHowever, the anxiety is specific to the sleepovers at the aunt's house, not separation in general, which might suggest a specific phobia or adjustment disorder. But given the pattern and his age, Separation Anxiety Disorder fits best. The bed-wetting could be enuresis, but it's noted as developmentally normal, so it might not be a disorder unless it's causing significant distress. Zack is embarrassed about it, especially after being teased, so Nocturnal Enuresis could be a secondary diagnosis. \n\nOther differentials to consider: Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety, given the stressor of the mother's new work schedule and sleepovers; Specific Phobia if the fear is specifically about the aunt's house; Generalized Anxiety Disorder, but the anxiety is focused on separation, not generalized; and perhaps Rule-out Trauma-related disorders, though there's no clear evidence of trauma aside from the teasing. \n\nI should also consider that the bed-wetting might be exacerbated by anxiety, making Enuresis a comorbid condition. The teasing could contribute to an Adjustment Disorder, but the core issue seems to be separation anxiety. So, prioritizing diagnoses: Separation Anxiety Disorder as primary, then Nocturnal Enuresis, Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety, Specific Phobia (situational), and maybe Other Specified Anxiety Disorder if the separation anxiety doesn't fully meet criteria, but it seems to. \n\nNeed to assign ICD-10 codes: Separation Anxiety Disorder is F93.0, Nocturnal Enuresis is F98.0, Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety is F43.22, Specific Phobia is F40.2xx (but since it's situational, maybe F40.248, other specified), and for the last, maybe Generalized Anxiety Disorder if needed, but the anxiety isn't generalized, so perhaps Other Specified Anxiety Disorder F41.8. However, the vignette points more to separation anxiety, so I'll stick with that hierarchy.",

    "vignette":"Aidan Johns, a 30-year-old graduate student in English, visited a psychiatrist to discuss his difficulty staying asleep. The trouble began 4 months earlier, when he started to wake up at 3:00 every morning, no matter when he went to bed, and then was unable to fall back to sleep. As a result, he felt \u201cout of it\u201d during the day. This led him to feel increasingly worried about how he was going to finish his doctoral dissertation when he was unable to concentrate owing to exhaustion. When his sleep difficulties began, he woke with nothing particular on his mind. As the trouble persisted, he found himself dreading the upcoming day and wondering how he would teach his classes or focus on his writing if he was getting only a few hours of sleep. Some mornings he lay awake in the dark next to his fianc\u00e9e, who was sleeping soundly. On other mornings he would cut his losses, rise from bed, and go very early to his office on campus.\n\nAfter a month of interrupted sleep, Mr. Johns visited a physician\u2019s assistant at the university\u2019s student health services, where he customarily got his medical care. (He suffered from asthma, for which he occasionally took inhaled \u03b22-adrenergic receptor agonists, and a year earlier he had had mononucleosis.) The physician\u2019s assistant prescribed a sedative-hypnotic, which did not help. \u201cFalling asleep was never the problem,\u201d Mr. Johns explained. Meanwhile, he heeded some of the advice he read online. Although he felt reliant on coffee during the day, he never drank it after 2:00 p.m. An avid tennis player, he restricted his court time to the early morning. He did have a glass or two of wine every night at dinner with his fianc\u00e9e, however. \u201cBy dinnertime I start to worry about whether I\u2019ll be able to sleep,\u201d he said, \u201cand, to be honest, the wine helps.\u201d\n\nThe patient, a slender and fit-appearing young man looking very much the part of the young academic in a tweed jacket and tortoise-rimmed glasses, was pleasant and open in his storytelling. Mr. Johns did not appear tired but told the evaluating psychiatrist, \u201cI made a point to see you in the morning, before I hit the wall.\u201d He did not look sad or on edge and was not sure if he had ever felt depressed. But he was certain of the nagging, low-level anxiety that was currently oppressing him. \u201cThis sleep problem has taken over,\u201d he explained. \u201cI\u2019m stressed about my work, and my fianc\u00e9e and I have been arguing. But it\u2019s all because I\u2019m so tired.\u201d\n\nAlthough this was his first visit to a psychiatrist, Mr. Johns spoke of a fulfilling 3-year psychodynamic psychotherapy with a social worker while in college. \u201cI was just looking to understand myself better,\u201d he explained, adding with a chuckle that as the son of a child psychiatrist, he was accustomed to people assuming he was \u201ccrazy.\u201d He recalled always being an \u201ceasy sleeper\u201d prior to his recent difficulties; as a child he was the first to fall asleep at slumber parties, and as an adult he inspired the envy of his fianc\u00e9e for the ease with which he could doze off on an airplane.",

The patient presents with chronic sleep maintenance insomnia (waking at 3 AM for 4 months) leading to daytime impairment.

    "vignette":"Bernadette Kleber was a 34-year-old divorced, unemployed white mother of three school-age children. She was living with a new companion. Ms. Kleber presented to a psychiatrist for anxiety and sleepiness.\n\nMs. Kleber had experienced anxiety much of her life, but she had become much more worried and stressed since the birth of her first child 10 years before. She said she was \u201cokay at home\u201d but anxious in social situations. She avoided having to interact with new people, fearing that she would be embarrassed and judged. For example, she wanted to lose the weight that she had gained since the births of her children (current body mass index [BMI] 27.7) but was afraid of the ridicule that might accompany her efforts at the gym. She had gradually withdrawn from situations in which she might be forced to meet new people, and this made it almost impossible for her to interview for a new job, much less work in one. She had been successfully treated for social anxiety disorder 5 years earlier with psychotherapy, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [SSRI] antidepressant, and clonazepam 0.25 mg twice daily, but her symptoms had returned over the prior year. She denied increasing the dose of either medication or taking any other medication (prescribed or over the counter) for anxiety. Although excited about her new relationship, she was worried her new girlfriend would leave her if she did not \u201ctune up my act.\u201d\n\nShe denied periods of significant depression, although she said she had experienced multiple periods of feeling frustrated with her limited effectiveness. She also denied all manic symptoms.\n\nThe psychiatrist then asked Ms. Kleber about her \u201csleepiness.\u201d She said she slept more than anyone she knew. She said she typically slept at least 9 hours per night but then took two naps for 5 additional hours during the day. She did not recall a problem until the end of high school, when she started falling asleep around 8:00 or 9:00 p.m. and dozing every afternoon. When she tried to go to college, she realized how much more sleep she needed than her friends and eventually dropped out because she could not stay awake in class. Despite the naps, she typically fell asleep when visiting friends or family and when reading or watching TV. She quit driving alone for fear of falling asleep at the wheel. Late afternoon naps were not restorative and had no apparent impact on her falling asleep at night.\n\nRaising a family was difficult, especially because mornings were Ms. Kleber\u2019s worst period. For at least half an hour after waking, she was disoriented and confused, making it difficult to get her children to school. Throughout the day, she said she felt \u201cscattered and inattentive.\u201d\n\nSnoring had appeared 5 years earlier. Her companion was unsure whether Ms. Kleber also had breathing pauses during her sleep. Ms. Kleber denied having ever experienced sleep paralysis or abruptly falling asleep in the middle of a sentence. Although she would fall asleep while socializing, it would generally occur during a lull in the conversation while she was in a quiet spot in the corner of a couch. She denied falling down when she fell asleep. She reported experiencing hypnopompic hallucinations several times per year since she was a teenager.\n\nOn examination, Ms. Kleber was an overweight woman who was cooperative and coherent. She was concerned about her anxiety but preoccupied with her sleep problem. She denied depression, suicidality, psychosis, and memory complaints. Her insight and judgment appeared intact.\n\nHer physical examination was essentially noncontributory. Her medical history was significant only for hypercholesterolemia and occasional migraine headaches. Ms. Kleber did have some muscular complaints, such as weakness in her legs and pain in her left arm; these were related to exertion. She has smoked marijuana occasionally to help with her pain but denied that the marijuana was an important contributor to her sleepiness. She denied a history of head trauma and unusual illnesses. She denied a family history of sleep or mood problems, although multiple relatives were \u201canxious.\u201d\n\nMs. Kleber was referred for sleep studies. Polysomnography showed an apnea hypopnea index of 3 events per hour. The next day, she underwent a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), which indicated a mean sleep latency of 7 minutes with one sleep-onset REM period during the testing. A lumbar puncture was done to assess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of hypocretin-1; the level appeared in the normal range.",

He had been euthymic and off all psychiatric medications for 2 years at the time of this evaluation.\n\nMr. Meng noted that his physical symptoms were worse at night, when he tried to sit still or lie down. The discomfort was only in his legs. Rubbing them helped, but the greatest relief came from standing up and pacing. Dialysis was especially difficult because of \u201cbeing strapped to a machine for hours.\u201d He also complained of daytime sleepiness and fatigue. In the course of the interview, Mr. Meng twice jumped up during the dialysis. One of the nurses mentioned that he often asked them to cut short his dialysis, generally looked tired, and always seemed to be \u201cjumping around.\u201d The staff wondered whether he might be nonadherent to his medications as well as being uncooperative at times during the dialysis.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, the user wants me to outline the clinical reasoning behind the diagnoses for this case vignette, but without including it in the actual response. First, I need to make sure I'm following the rubric closely for both data extraction and diagnostic reasoning. Let me start by carefully reading the vignette again.\n\nMr. Meng is 63, with a history of psychotic depression, but he's been off psychiatric meds and euthymic for two years. His current symptoms are focused on physical sensations like itching and crawling under the skin, especially in his legs, worse at night and during dialysis. He gets relief from moving or pacing. Daytime sleepiness and fatigue are mentioned too. The staff notes he's restless, often jumps up during dialysis, and seems tired.\n\nLooking at the data extraction part, I need to identify subtle cues. The itching and crawling sensations could be formication, often linked to substance use or medical issues, but here it's localized to legs and worse at rest. That points towards a restless legs syndrome (RLS) presentation. The relief with movement is a key clue. Also, his history of diabetes and dialysis suggests possible uremic or neuropathic causes. \n\nFor diagnostic reasoning, I have to consider differentials. Primary diagnosis seems like Restless Legs Syndrome, which fits the DSM-5 criteria under \"Substance\/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder\" if related to his medical condition, but actually, RLS is often a standalone diagnosis. Wait, the user mentioned ICD-10 F-codes, so I need to find the appropriate code for RLS. It might be F51.8 for other specified sleep-wake disorders. \n\nNext, considering his past psychotic depression, but he's currently euthymic. However, the \"going crazy\" comment and somatic complaints could indicate a somatic symptom disorder or illness anxiety disorder. But the physical symptoms are explained by RLS, so maybe somatic symptom disorder isn't the primary. Still, it should be in the differential because of his excessive focus on physical issues.\n\nAdjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood is there because he mentions worry and tiredness but cheers up with family, so not a full depressive episode. Akathisia was considered in the chart, but he's off psych meds, so medication-induced is less likely unless from other meds. Peripheral neuropathy is medical, but since we're only listing psychiatric diagnoses with F-codes, I'll exclude that. \n\nSleep-wake disorder due to a medical condition (uremia from dialysis) could explain daytime sleepiness. His fatigue might be part of that. Also, the nonadherence and uncooperative behavior might hint at psychological factors affecting other medical conditions. But prioritizing based on the vignette, RLS seems the most supported given the specific symptoms.\n\nLet me list the top five: primary is restless legs syndrome (F51.8). Secondary could include adjustment disorder (F43.23), somatic symptom disorder (F45.1), other specified anxiety disorder (F41.8) maybe for the worry, and psychological factors affecting other medical conditions (F54). I need to ensure each has an ICD-10 F-code and that they're psychiatric diagnoses. \n\nDouble-checking the codes: Restless Legs Syndrome is often coded under G25.81, but that's not an F-code. Wait, DSM-5 includes it under sleep-wake disorders, so F51.8 might be correct. Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood is F43.23. Somatic symptom disorder is F45.1. Other specified anxiety disorder is F41.8. Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions is F54. \n\nMake sure I'm not including non-psychiatric ones. Peripheral neuropathy would be G code, so exclude. Akathisia might be medication-induced movement disorder, but he's off meds, so maybe not primary. Also, his past psychotic depression isn't current, so not included. \n\nFinally, structure the response exactly as requested: numbered list with primary and four secondaries, each with F-code. No reasoning in the response, just the list.",

    "vignette":"Elizabeth Olsen and Finn Nelson presented for couples counseling in the context of increased arguments prior to their upcoming wedding. They were both successful attorneys in their late 30s. They had known each other since high school, had been dating for about 2 years, and planned to get married in about 6 months. Both denied ever having previously seen a therapist or received a psychiatric diagnosis.\n\nThe couples therapist met with them together for one session. Both Ms. Olsen and Mr. Nelson reported being very much in love and wanting the marriage to work out, but they also said that they were fighting much of the time. Ms. Olsen said she admired Mr. Nelson\u2019s intelligence and steadiness and did not know why they fought. He, on the other hand, said he was still \u201ctotally infatuated\u201d but upset about Ms. Olsen\u2019s overall lack of interest in him. As the session neared a close, Mr. Nelson asked Ms. Olsen whether she wanted to bring up \u201cthe schedule, the alcohol, or the sex thing,\u201d at which she smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid we\u2019re out of time for today.\u201d\n\nThe therapist met with each of them separately. At his meeting, Mr. Nelson said his biggest concern with Ms. Olsen was her lack of interest in sex. She seemed to go through the motions, he said, and always relied on alcohol. He worried that he was a \u201c7 trying to date a 10\u201d and that she just did not find him attractive. He was distressed about the fact that, try as he might, he was unable to bring her to orgasm or even to get her significantly aroused. This was, in turn, leading him to initiate sex less frequently, and even when he tried, he would \u201coften just give up half-way through.\u201d He had brought it up with her several times, but she had insisted that there was no problem. The therapist asked what he had meant by \u201cthe schedule thing.\u201d He explained that since they had begun dating, she had limited their time together to one \u201cschool night,\u201d usually a Tuesday, and then either a Friday or Saturday night. She had insisted that the schedule was necessary for her to complete her work and see her best girlfriends, but he had increasingly come to believe it was to avoid him.\n\nIn her individual session, Ms. Olsen said she was most frustrated by Mr. Nelson\u2019s intensity and high desire for sex. She had set up their weekly schedule because otherwise he would want to constantly have sex with her. As it was, he wanted sex every time they got together, often twice in the same night. She readily admitted that she got drunk to tolerate intercourse. She added that she had used alcohol to numb herself since she began dating while in her teens. Until she had started dating Mr. Nelson, most of her sexual experiences had been \u201cwhile drunk with strangers.\u201d She had had a couple of boyfriends, but one was secretly gay and the other was \u201chappy to get a blow job every now and then.\u201d She had not told Mr. Nelson about these misadventures because she preferred that he continue to see her as \u201cthe near-virginal beauty queen.\u201d Although alcohol made intercourse acceptable, \u201csexual arousal was almost never tolerable\u201d and made her want to pass out. In recent months, Mr. Nelson had increasingly \u201cforced the orgasm issue.\u201d In the past, she would simply have broken up with any boyfriend who acted that way, but she believed she needed to stick it out because she was nearing 40 and this would be her \u201clast chance to have a baby.\u201d When asked why she thought she had these issues with sex, Ms. Olsen looked out the window for almost a minute and then answered, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d",

The user wants a structured list of five diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes without clinical reasoning. The rubric emphasizes sophisticated data extraction and diagnostic reasoning at Level 5.\n\nFirst, I need to extract key information. Ms. Olsen shows avoidance of sexual activity, reliance on alcohol for intercourse tolerance, inability to achieve arousal\/orgasm despite normal sexual function, distress about sexual intimacy, and a history suggesting possible trauma. Mr. Nelson's concerns are secondary to her condition.\n\nFor primary diagnosis, Genito-Pelvic Pain\/Penetration Disorder fits best given her marked difficulty with vaginal penetration, marked fear\/anxiety about pain, and marked tensing of pelvic floor muscles (implied by needing alcohol to tolerate intercourse). The specifier \"With Non-Sexual Mental Disorder\" applies due to alcohol use.\n\nNext, Alcohol Use Disorder appears moderate: tolerance (needing more for same effect), use in hazardous situations, continued use despite problems. Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder is considered but less likely than Avoidant Personality Disorder given her pervasive pattern of avoidance in relationships and fear of rejection.\n\nOther Specified Personality Disorder fits her mixed features of avoidant and obsessive-compulsive traits without full criteria for either.

    "vignette":"Gerhard Palmer, a 55-year-old married accountant, presented to a psychiatrist for a second opinion in the context of recurrent major depressive disorder. He had not responded to two 3-month antidepressant trials, one with fluoxetine and another with sertraline, both at high dosages. At the time of his presentation, he had not taken any antidepressant medication since the trial with sertraline (about a month earlier).\n\nThe evaluation revealed a severely depressed man with profound psychomotor retardation, poor concentration, early insomnia, mildly diminished libido, and anhedonia. Mr. Palmer denied a substance use disorder, drank minimally, and did not smoke. He had started taking propranolol for hypertension about 6 months previously. His physical examination was unremarkable. Basic laboratory tests were within normal limits. His blood pressure was 135\/85.\n\nTreatment with clomipramine was initiated and was quickly increased, as tolerated, to the recommended maximum dosage of 250 mg\/day. Buspirone 30 mg\/day was added. After 5 weeks of treatment, Mr. Palmer reported feeling much improved. He was sleeping and eating well, was participating in enjoyable activities with increasing enthusiasm, and, for the first time in many months, felt a return of his sexual interest.\n\nAfter not having had sexual intercourse in months, Mr. Palmer tried unsuccessfully to have sex several times. He was distressed to find that for the first time in his life, he was unable to maintain an erection during intercourse and was unable to ejaculate, even during masturbation. These problems persisted for a month. He recalled having had slightly delayed ejaculation while taking fluoxetine. He did not recall sexual problems during a prior trial of bupropion.",

    "model_thoughts":"First, I need to diagnose based on the clinical case vignette of Gerhard Palmer. I must follow the rubric but not output clinical reasoning; only provide a structured list of the top 5 most likely DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes.\n\nThe vignette describes a 55-year-old man with recurrent major depressive disorder that didn't respond to two SSRIs (fluoxetine and sertraline). He was treated with clomipramine (a tricyclic antidepressant) and buspirone, and after 5 weeks, he improved in mood but developed sexual dysfunction: inability to maintain an erection and ejaculate, which persisted for a month. He had slightly delayed ejaculation on fluoxetine but no problems on bupropion.\n\nKey elements:\n- Recurrent major depressive disorder.\n- Treatment-resistant depression (failed two antidepressant trials).\n- On clomipramine and buspirone.\n- Sexual dysfunction after starting clomipramine: erectile dysfunction and anejaculation.\n- History of delayed ejaculation on fluoxetine.\n- No substance use, minimal drinking, on propranolol for hypertension.\n\nNow, I need to identify psychiatric diagnoses. The primary issue seems to be major depressive disorder, but with treatment-emergent side effects. The sexual dysfunction is likely due to medication side effects, specifically from clomipramine, which is known to cause sexual side effects.\n\nDSM-5-TR diagnoses:\n1. Primary diagnosis: Recurrent Major Depressive Disorder, as he has a history and current symptoms.\n2. The sexual dysfunction could be diagnosed as Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction.\n3. He might have Treatment-Resistant Depression, but DSM-5 doesn't have a specific code for that; it's a specifier for major depressive disorder.\n4. Other possibilities: Since he improved on clomipramine, the depression is in remission or responding, but the sexual dysfunction is a new issue.\n\nLet's list possible diagnoses:\n- Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent Episode, in partial or full remission? After treatment, he's much improved, so perhaps in remission, but the vignette says \"feeling much improved,\" not necessarily fully remitted.\n- Sexual Dysfunction Due to Another Medical Condition or Substance\/Medication: Here, it's likely medication-induced.\n- Anxiety disorders? Buspirone is for anxiety, but no clear anxiety symptoms mentioned. He was given buspirone adjunctively for depression, possibly.\n- Substance\/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction.\n\nFrom DSM-5-TR:\n- F33.x for Recurrent Major Depressive Disorder. Need to specify current severity; since he improved, perhaps in partial remission, but the vignette starts with severe depression.\n- F52.21 for Male Erectile Disorder, but if medication-induced, it might be F52.8 or related.\n- Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction is coded based on the substance. For clomipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, it could be F52.8 (Other Sexual Dysfunction Not Due to a Substance or Known Physiological Condition) or more specifically under substance-induced.\n\nDSM-5-TR uses F codes for ICD-10. For medication-induced disorders, the code depends on the type. For example, Substance\/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction has codes like F52.8 for unspecified, or with specific substances.\n\nLet me recall ICD-10 codes:\n- F33.0: Major depressive disorder, recurrent, mild\n- F33.1: Moderate\n- F33.2: Severe without psychotic symptoms\n- F33.3: Severe with psychotic symptoms\n- F33.4: In remission\n- For sexual dysfunction: F52.0: Hypoactive sexual desire disorder, F52.1: Sexual aversion disorder, F52.2: Female sexual arousal disorder, F52.21: Male erectile disorder, F52.31: Female orgasmic disorder, F52.32: Male orgasmic disorder, F52.8: Other sexual dysfunction\n- Medication-induced: Often coded as F19.9 for other psychoactive substance, but for antidepressants, it might be under specific categories.\n\nIn DSM-5-TR, for diagnosis, if the sexual dysfunction is due to a medication, it's classified as Substance\/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction. The ICD-10 code is F52.8 for other sexual dysfunction, or with a substance code.\n\nTo be precise, I need to list the top 5 diagnoses. The primary should be Major Depressive Disorder, as that's why he presented. Then, secondary diagnoses related to treatment and side effects.\n\nPossible diagnoses:\n1. Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Severe (since he had severe psychomotor retardation, anhedonia, etc.) \u2013 but after treatment, improved, so perhaps in partial remission. The vignette says at presentation, he was severely depressed, so current episode might be severe.\n2. Substance\/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction (due to clomipramine) \u2013 with symptoms of erectile dysfunction and delayed ejaculation.\n3. Treatment-Resistant Depression \u2013 but this is a specifier, not a separate diagnosis. DSM-5 uses specifiers like \"with treatment-resistant features,\" but it's part of MDD diagnosis.\n4. Other Specified Depressive Disorder? No, he meets criteria for MDD.\n5. Anxiety disorder? Not mentioned.\n6. Sexual Dysfunction Not Otherwise Specified.\n\nSince he is on propranolol, but no psychiatric symptoms from that mentioned. Also, buspirone might contribute, but clomipramine is the likely culprit for sexual dysfunction.\n\nHe had delayed ejaculation on fluoxetine, which is an SSRI, and clomipramine is a tricyclic but also has serotonergic effects causing sexual side effects.\n\nSo, primary diagnosis: F33.2 Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe without psychotic symptoms (at presentation, he was severely depressed; after treatment, improved, but for diagnosis, we consider the episode).\n\nBut in DSM-5, when in remission, we code as in remission. However, the vignette says he presented with severe depression, and after treatment, improved, but the diagnosis is based on the condition. Since he is still under treatment and improved, it might be in partial remission.\n\nTo simplify, I'll use F33.2 for severe episode.\n\nFor sexual dysfunction: Since it's due to medication, Substance\/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction. ICD-10 code: For antidepressant-induced, it might be F52.8 or with a specific substance code. In ICD-10, medication-induced disorders are often coded under the mental and behavioral disorders due to psychoactive substance use, but for prescribed medications, it's coded similarly.\n\nDSM-5-TR: For Substance\/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction, the code depends on the substance class. For antidepressants, which are sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics? Antidepressants are not specifically listed; they might fall under \"other substance.\" The code is F52.8 for other sexual dysfunction not due to a substance or known physiological condition, but if due to substance, it's F1x.94 for various substances.\n\nActually, in ICD-10, substance-induced sexual dysfunction is coded under the substance use disorder category with a fourth character for sexual dysfunction. For example, for antidepressants, since they are not typically abused, it might be F55.8 for abuse of non-psychoactive substances, but that's for abuse. For therapeutic use, it's adverse effect, coded as T43.2 for antidepressant adverse effect, but for psychiatric diagnosis, we use F codes.\n\nIn DSM-5, for diagnosis, we use the specific F code for the disorder. For Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction, the ICD-10 code is F52.8, and specify the substance.\n\nFrom DSM-5-TR Appendix: ICD-10-CM Codes for DSM-5 Diagnoses.\n\nFor Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent: F33.0 to F33.4 based on severity and remission.\n\nFor Substance\/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction: The code is F52.8, and for the substance, e.g., for antidepressant, code T43.205A for adverse effect, but for psychiatric diagnosis, we use F52.8 with specification.\n\nTo keep it within psychiatric F-codes, I'll use F52.8 for sexual dysfunction.\n\nOther possible diagnoses:\n- Since he had treatment-resistant depression, but no separate code.\n- Hypertension is not psychiatric, so don't include.\n- Insomnia is part of depression.\n- Anhedonia is part of depression.\n\nPerhaps Secondary Diagnosis: Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction.\nAnother: Major Depressive Disorder in Partial Remission.\nAnother: Other Specified Sexual Dysfunction.\nBut need top 5.\n\nList potential diagnoses:\n1. Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Severe Without Psychotic Features (F33.2) \u2013 primary.\n2. Substance\/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction (F52.8) \u2013 due to clomipramine.\n3. Sexual Dysfunction Not Otherwise Specified \u2013 but F52.8 covers it.\n4. Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition? No, hypertension controlled, no indication.\n5. Anxiety Disorder Unspecified? Buspirone is for anxiety, but no symptoms mentioned, so probably not.\n6. Other Specified Depressive Disorder? No.\n\nHe might have Sexual Desire Disorder or Orgasmic Disorder specifically. For him, it's erectile dysfunction and anejaculation, so Male Erectile Disorder (F52.21) and Male Orgasmic Disorder (F52.32), but if medication-induced, it's under substance-induced.\n\nIn DSM-5, for Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction, it can specify with impaired desire, arousal, or orgasm. Here, impaired arousal (erectile dysfunction) and orgasm (anejaculation).\n\nSo, perhaps one diagnosis for substance-induced sexual dysfunction covering both.\n\nTo have top 5, I need to list plausible psychiatric diagnoses. Since he has only depression and sexual dysfunction, maybe list specifiers or related conditions.\n\nAnother thought: He might have Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) with major depressive episodes, but vignette says recurrent major depressive disorder.\n\nAlso, rule out bipolar? No manic symptoms mentioned.\n\nPersonality disorder? Not indicated.\n\nSo, primary is MDD. Secondary is medication-induced sexual dysfunction.\n\nBut for top 5, I can include:\n1. Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Severe (F33.2)\n2. Substance\/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction (F52.8)\n3. Other Specified Depressive Disorder (for treatment-resistant aspect) \u2013 F32.89 or F33.89\n4. Male Erectile Disorder (F52.21) \u2013 if not medication-induced, but it is.\n5. Male Orgasmic Disorder (F52.32)\n\nBut in DSM-5, if it's due to medication, we don't diagnose separate erectile or orgasmic disorders; we use substance-induced.\n\nSo, to be accurate, after MDD, the next is Substance\/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction.\n\nPerhaps include: Sexual Dysfunction Due to a General Medical Condition? But it's due to medication, not hypertension directly.\n\nPropranolol can cause sexual dysfunction, but he was on it for 6 months, and sexual problems started after clomipramine, so likely clomipramine.\n\nBuspar (buspirone) can cause sexual side effects, but less common.\n\nSo, primary diagnosis: F33.2 Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe without psychotic symptoms.\n\nSecondary diagnoses:\n- F52.8 Other sexual dysfunction not due to a substance or known physiological condition? But it is due to substance, so F52.8 with specifier for medication-induced. In ICD-10, for medication-induced, it might be coded under F55.8 for abuse of non-psychoactive substances, but that's for abuse. For adverse effect, it's T code, but for psychiatric diagnosis, F52.8 is used.\n\nChecking DSM-5-TR: For Substance\/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction, the ICD-10 code is F52.8, and for the substance, e.g., for antidepressant, code the substance separately for medical coding, but for this exercise, I think F52.8 is fine.\n\nTo list top 5, I can have:\n1. F33.2 Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe without psychotic features\n2. F52.8 Other sexual dysfunction not due to a substance or known physiological condition (medication-induced)\n3. F33.4 Major depressive disorder, recurrent, in remission (since he improved)\n4. F52.21 Male erectile disorder\n5. F52.32 Male orgasmic disorder\n\nBut points 4 and 5 are subsets of point 2 if medication-induced.\n\nIn DSM-5, for medication-induced, we don't assign separate diagnoses for specific sexual dysfunctions; it's one diagnosis.\n\nSo, perhaps only two diagnoses: MDD and medication-induced sexual dysfunction. But I need top 5, so I must list other possibilities, even if less likely.\n\nConsider: He might have Anxiety Disorder NOS because buspirone was added, but no anxiety symptoms mentioned, so not justified.\n\nPerhaps: Unspecified Depressive Disorder? No.\n\nOther: Adjustment Disorder? No, it's recurrent MDD.\n\nSince he failed two antidepressants, perhaps Specifier for Treatment-Resistant Depression, which is not a separate code.\n\nI could list:\n1. F33.2 Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe\n2. F52.8 Substance\/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction\n3. F41.9 Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (since buspirone is for anxiety, but weak)\n4. F43.23 Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood? No, it's recurrent.\n5. F99 Other mental disorder? Not specific.\n\nTo follow the instruction: \"top 5 most likely diagnoses\" \u2013 so I need to list the most plausible ones based on the vignette.\n\nRe-reading vignette: He presented for second opinion for recurrent major depressive disorder, failed two antidepressants, then on clomipramine improved but with sexual side effects.\n\nSo, diagnoses:\n- Major Depressive Disorder (primary)\n- Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction (secondary)\n- Possibly Sexual Dysfunction Not Otherwise Specified if not medication-induced, but it is.\n- Perhaps Rule Out Bipolar Depression, but no history.\n- Substance Use Disorder? Denied.\n\nHe drank minimally, so no alcohol use disorder.\n\nNo other substances.\n\nPerhaps Insomnia Disorder? But insomnia is part of depression.\n\nSo, I think for top 5, I can include:\n1. Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Severe (F33.2)\n2. Substance\/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction (F52.8)\n3. Major Depressive Disorder, In Partial Remission (F33.41) \u2013 since he improved but not fully, and sexual issues are new.\n4. Other Specified Sexual Dysfunction (F52.8) \u2013 similar to above.\n5. Unspecified Depressive Disorder (F32.9) \u2013 but he has recurrent MDD.\n\nTo be precise, after treatment, the MDD might be in partial remission, so code as F33.41 for recurrent in partial remission.\n\nAt presentation, severe; after treatment, partial remission.\n\nIn diagnosis, we often state the current status. Since he is still under treatment and improved, partial remission is appropriate.\n\nSo, primary diagnosis: F33.41 Major depressive disorder, recurrent, in partial remission.\n\nThen, for sexual dysfunction: F52.8 Other sexual dysfunction.\n\nBut in the list, I need to output only diagnoses, no reasoning.\n\nFinal decision for top 5:\n1. Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, in Partial Remission - ICD-10 F33.41\n2. Substance\/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction - ICD-10 F52.8\n3. Male Erectile Disorder - ICD-10 F52.21\n4. Male Orgasmic Disorder - ICD-10 F52.32\n5. Other Specified Depressive Disorder (for treatment-resistant aspect) - ICD-10 F33.8\n\nBut F33.8 is other recurrent depressive disorders, which could include treatment-resistant.\n\nAlternatively, use:\n1. F33.2 Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe\n2. F52.8 Other sexual dysfunction\n3. F33.4 Major depressive disorder, recurrent, in remission\n4. F52.21 Male erectile disorder\n5. F52.32 Male orgasmic disorder\n\nI think since he improved, partial remission is more accurate than severe.\n\nThe vignette says after treatment, he reported feeling much improved, so likely in partial remission.\n\nSo, I'll go with:\n1. Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, in Partial Remission - F33.41\n2. Substance\/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction - F52.8\n3. Male Erectile Disorder - F52.21\n4. Male Orgasmic Disorder - F52.32\n5. Other Recurrent Depressive Disorders - F33.8 (to capture treatment-resistant)\n\nBut in DSM-5, treatment-resistant is not a separate diagnosis; it's a specifier under MDD.\n\nTo keep it simple and based on most likely, I'll list:\n1. Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent - F33.9 (unspecified severity) but to be specific.\n\nI need to choose specific codes.\n\nLet's list as per DSM-5-TR common codes.\n\nAfter thinking, I'll proceed with:\n1. Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Severe Without Psychotic Features - F33.2\n2. Substance\/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction - F52.8\n3. Major Depressive Disorder, in Partial Remission - F33.41\n4. Male Erectile Disorder - F52.21\n5. Male Orgasmic Disorder - F52.32\n\nBut F33.2 and F33.41 are different specifiers for the same disorder; in practice, we use one current diagnosis. Since he is improved, F33.41 might be better for current state.\n\nThe vignette presents the history and current state, so for diagnosis, we consider the ongoing condition.\n\nI think for primary, it should be the reason for presentation, which is MDD, and since it's recurrent and he is under treatment, in partial remission.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, final list:\n1.

    "vignette":"Irene Rohmer, a 25-year-old salesperson, presented to a psychiatrist because of anxiety and depression. She began by stating that any assessment of her mood would have to take into consideration other aspects of her personal journey.\n\nMs. Rohmer had been born without complications, assigned male at birth, and raised as a boy. As long as she could remember, she had been teased and called a \u201csissy\u201d by neighborhood boys. She had generally preferred the company of girls throughout childhood. During her teen years, she continued to have many female friends but considered herself a gay male and dated a few other gay teens. She recalled trying her best to \u201cfit in\u201d but noted that she had always felt like an outsider.\n\nAt age 19, during a romantic relationship with a man, she become aware of an intense desire to be a woman. That relationship ended, but Ms. Rohmer\u2019s desire to be a woman evolved into a strong sense that she had been born as the wrong gender. She tried to figure out whether this sense had existed earlier, but all she could recall was occasionally wishing she were a girl to fit in more comfortably with her friends.\n\nBy age 20, Ms. Rohmer was very unhappy about being seen as a man. She viewed her genitalia as \u201crepugnant\u201d and a \u201cmistake of nature.\u201d Her family and some of her friends had not supported her developing sense of herself, and she recalled feeling increasingly hopeless, with episodic suicidal ideation and one nonlethal suicide attempt by overdose at age 21.\n\nBeginning at age 22, Ms. Rohmer lived as a female, including changing her name and exclusively wearing women\u2019s clothes. She struggled to access appropriate health services and encountered multiple barriers to obtaining appropriate treatments, but, at the age of 24, Ms. Rohmer was evaluated by two psychiatrists skilled in transgender health, who agreed with her perspective, and she started gender-affirming hormone therapy.\n\nAs her transition progressed, she began to feel more comfortable in the female role and pleased with having secondary sexual characteristics that were more consistent with her experienced gender. She explored her sexuality during this time, dating both gay and straight men. Her anxiety diminished, although, as a member of a disenfranchised subgroup, she felt vulnerable to various types of aggression, including potential partner violence.\n\nThe following year, at age 25, Ms. Rohmer had the gender on her driver\u2019s license and passport changed from male to female (a change of gender markers) and underwent gender-affirming surgeries that included vaginoplasty and breast augmentation. The results of these surgeries were satisfactory, and she was often happy with the transition. She described herself as being \u201cmore comfortable in her skin\u201d than she had ever been, and she only infrequently felt hopeless and suicidal. Despite not feeling particularly accepted by her family of origin or by some of her old friends, she found warm support from other friends and colleagues at work. Although she has many friends who are gender nonbinary\/gender nonconforming, Ms. Rohmer identifies as a heterosexual female.\n\nShe said she tended to worry that people were judging her negatively, but this worry was less intense now than it had been earlier in her transition. She denied any recent suicide attempts, depression, or self-injurious behavior. She said she had \u201calmost\u201d given up on having a successful relationship but was \u201csomehow\u201d still optimistic that something would work out.",

    "model_thoughts":"First, I need to read the clinical case vignette carefully and extract relevant information to support my diagnostic reasoning. The rubric requires me to perform at Level 5 for both Data Extraction and Organization, and Diagnostic Reasoning and Differential Diagnosis. However, the instruction says: \"Do not output any of your clinical reasoning; your response should consist only of the structured list of diagnoses and corresponding F-codes.\" So, I should not include my reasoning in the final response, but I need to use it internally to come up with the diagnoses.\n\nThe task is to provide a structured list of DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes. I must base this only on the information provided and not fabricate details. The list should have the primary diagnosis and four secondary diagnoses, all with F-codes.\n\nLet me extract key information from the vignette:\n\n- Patient: Irene Rohmer, 25-year-old salesperson.\n\n- Presenting concerns: Anxiety and depression, but the assessment needs to consider her personal journey.\n\n- History: Born male, assigned male at birth, but from childhood, preferred company of girls, teased as a \"sissy.\" In teens, identified as a gay male. At age 19, developed intense desire to be a woman, leading to a strong sense of being born the wrong gender.\n\n- By age 20, unhappy being seen as a man, viewed genitalia as repugnant, felt hopeless with episodic suicidal ideation and one nonlethal suicide attempt at age 21.\n\n- At age 22, started living as female, changed name, wore women's clothes. Accessed gender-affirming care at age 24, started hormone therapy.\n\n- At age 25, changed gender markers, underwent gender-affirming surgeries (vaginoplasty and breast augmentation). Results satisfactory, more comfortable, less hopeless and suicidal.\n\n- Current state: Feels more comfortable, less anxious, but worries about being judged, though less intense. Denies recent suicide attempts, depression, or self-injury. Identifies as a heterosexual female. Has support from friends and colleagues, but not fully accepted by family and some old friends. Optimistic about relationships but somewhat hesitant.\n\nNow, I need to identify psychiatric diagnoses based on DSM-5-TR. The primary issue seems to be gender dysphoria, given the history of distress due to incongruence between assigned gender and experienced gender.\n\nDSM-5-TR criteria for Gender Dysphoria:\n\n- A marked incongruence between one\u2019s experienced\/expressed gender and assigned gender, of at least 6 months duration.\n\n- The condition is associated with clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\n\nFrom the vignette: She experienced distress from age 19 onwards, with unhappiness, repugnance towards genitalia, hopelessness, suicidal ideation, and attempt. After transitioning, distress diminished, but she still has some worries. The diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria can be applicable if distress or impairment is present, even after transition, but it might be in remission or resolved. However, DSM-5-TR allows for post-transition specifier if the individual has undergone at least one cross-sex medical procedure or treatment and no longer meets the full criteria but requires ongoing care.\n\nIn this case, she has undergone hormone therapy and surgeries, and her distress has decreased. But she still has some anxiety and worries. The diagnosis might still be relevant, especially as she is under psychiatric care.\n\nOther diagnoses to consider:\n\n- Anxiety: She presents with anxiety and worries about being judged. This could be Generalized Anxiety Disorder or Social Anxiety Disorder. However, the worry is specifically about judgment related to her gender identity, which might be better captured under Gender Dysphoria or as an adjustment issue.\n\n- Depression: She had episodes of hopelessness and suicidal ideation, with one attempt. This could indicate a Depressive Disorder, like Major Depressive Disorder or Persistent Depressive Disorder. But currently, she denies recent depression, so it might be in remission or past.\n\n- Suicide attempt: History of nonlethal overdose, which is a significant risk factor.\n\n- She also mentions feeling like an outsider, which might relate to social issues or personality traits, but no clear personality disorder is indicated.\n\nBased on DSM-5-TR, the primary diagnosis should be Gender Dysphoria, as it's the core issue. The ICD-10 code for Gender Dysphoria is F64.9 (Gender identity disorder, unspecified) or more specific codes. DSM-5-TR uses F64.1 for Gender dysphoria in adolescents and adults, but ICD-10 codes: F64.0 for Transsexualism, F64.1 for Dual-role transvestism, F64.8 for Other gender identity disorders, F64.9 for Gender identity disorder, unspecified. Since she has undergone medical transition, F64.0 (Transsexualism) might be appropriate. In DSM-5-TR, the diagnosis is Gender Dysphoria, and ICD-10 code is F64.9 for unspecified, but for accuracy, I should use the specific code.\n\nICD-10 codes for psychiatric disorders:\n\n- Gender Dysphoria: F64.1 (Gender identity disorder in adolescence and adulthood) or F64.0 (Transsexualism). According to DSM-5-TR, the corresponding ICD-10 code for Gender Dysphoria is F64.9, but it's often specified. To be precise, I'll use F64.9 or check common usage. Since she is an adult and has transitioned, F64.0 might be used for transsexualism.\n\nBut let's see the vignette: She identifies as a heterosexual female now, and has undergone surgeries. In DSM-5-TR, if the individual has transitioned and no longer experiences distress, the diagnosis may not be current, but it can be specified as post-transition. The vignette says she is \"more comfortable\" but still has some worries, so distress might be present but reduced.\n\nOther diagnoses:\n\n- History of depressive episodes with suicidal behavior: Could be Major Depressive Disorder, single or recurrent, in partial or full remission. ICD-10 code for Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, in remission: F32.5, or recurrent: F33.40, etc. But since it's past, it might be listed as a historical diagnosis.\n\n- Anxiety: She worries about being judged, which could be Social Anxiety Disorder (F40.10) or Generalized Anxiety Disorder (F41.1). However, the worry is context-specific to her gender identity, so it might be an associated feature of Gender Dysphoria.\n\n- Suicide attempt: Not a diagnosis itself, but can be coded under Suicidal behavior history (T14.91 in ICD-10, but that's not an F-code). For psychiatric purposes, it might be included as a risk factor in the diagnosis of depression or other disorders.\n\n- No evidence of other disorders like psychosis, bipolar, etc.\n\n- She has a history of social issues and feeling like an outsider, but no clear criteria for personality disorders.\n\nThe vignette presents her for anxiety and depression, but upon assessment, the core issue is gender dysphoria, which has been addressed through transition. Current symptoms are residual anxiety.\n\nIn terms of differential diagnosis, I need to list the top 5 most likely diagnoses.\n\nPrimary diagnosis: Gender Dysphoria, as it's the underlying condition that led to her distress.\n\nSecondary diagnoses: Considering her history and current state.\n\n1. Gender Dysphoria \u2013 F64.1 (or F64.0, but I'll use F64.1 for consistency with DSM-5-TR, which maps to F64.9 in ICD-10). Actually, in ICD-10, F64.1 is \"Dual-role transvestism,\" which is not exactly this. F64.0 is \"Transsexualism,\" which might fit better. To align with DSM-5-TR, the code is F64.9. Let me confirm: DSM-5-TR uses ICD-10 codes, and for Gender Dysphoria in adolescents and adults, it's F64.1? I recall that in the DSM-5, the code is 302.85 which corresponds to F64.9 in ICD-10. Upon checking: DSM-5-TR lists the ICD-10-CM code for Gender Dysphoria as F64.2 for children and F64.1 for adolescents and adults. Wait, no: In DSM-5, the code for Gender Dysphoria is 302.85, and in ICD-10-CM, it's F64.9. But there are specific codes: F64.0 for transsexualism, F64.1 for gender identity disorder in adolescence and adulthood not elsewhere classified. I think for clinical purposes, F64.9 is often used. To be accurate, since she has undergone medical transition, F64.0 might be appropriate, but DSM-5-TR uses a single code for Gender Dysphoria. Let's look it up: In DSM-5-TR, the diagnostic code for Gender Dysphoria is 302.85 (F64.9). Yes, the ICD-10-CM code is F64.9 Gender identity disorder, unspecified. So I'll use F64.9.\n\nBut let's see the instruction: \"corresponding ICD-10 F-codes\", so I need to use the ICD-10 codes, not necessarily DSM-5 codes. In ICD-10, Gender Dysphoria is under F64. So I'll use F64.9 for simplicity, or specify.\n\nNow for secondary diagnoses:\n\n- She has a history of depression and suicidal behavior. So, Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in partial remission or past. ICD-10 code: F33.4 for recurrent depressive disorder, currently in remission.\n\n- Anxiety: Generalized Anxiety Disorder or Social Anxiety Disorder. Based on \"worries that people were judging her negatively,\" it sounds like Social Anxiety Disorder. ICD-10: F40.10 for Social phobia, unspecified.\n\n- She had a suicide attempt, which can be coded under Suicidal ideation or behavior, but that's not a separate diagnosis in DSM-5-TR; it's a symptom. So, probably not listed as a separate diagnosis.\n\n- Adjustment Disorder might be considered due to stressors related to transition and social acceptance, but she has specific anxiety.\n\n- No substance use or other disorders mentioned.\n\nConsidering the top 5:\n\n1. Primary: Gender Dysphoria \u2013 F64.9\n\n2. Secondary: Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in remission \u2013 F33.4\n\n3. Secondary: Social Anxiety Disorder \u2013 F40.10\n\n4. Secondary: History of Suicidal Behavior \u2013 but this is not a DSM-5-TR diagnosis with an F-code; it's coded under Z91.5 in ICD-10, which is not an F-code. So, I should stick to psychiatric diagnoses only.\n\n5. Perhaps Persistent Depressive Disorder if the depression was chronic, but it seems episodic.\n\nShe also mentions \"anxiety and depression\" as presenting concerns, so both should be addressed.\n\nAnother possibility: Since she has undergone transition and is doing better, Gender Dysphoria might be in remission, and the current issues could be residual anxiety or adjustment issues.\n\nBut based on the vignette, she is presenting for anxiety and depression, and the history is provided. So, current diagnoses might include Gender Dysphoria (post-transition), with comorbid anxiety disorder.\n\nList in order of likelihood or relevance:\n\n- Gender Dysphoria is the overarching diagnosis.\n\n- Then, Depressive Disorder due to past episodes.\n\n- Anxiety Disorder due to current worries.\n\n- She also has a history of suicide attempt, but as said, not a separate diagnosis.\n\n- Perhaps No diagnosis if symptoms are subthreshold, but she is presenting for care, so likely diagnosable.\n\nThe instruction says \"top 5 most likely diagnoses,\" so I need to list five. But there might not be five clear diagnoses. I can include less likely ones, but based on the information, only a few are evident.\n\nLet's think of differentials:\n\n1. Gender Dysphoria \u2013 F64.9\n\n2. Major Depressive Disorder \u2013 F32.9 or F33.9, but since recurrent, F33.9\n\n3. Social Anxiety Disorder \u2013 F40.10\n\n4. Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood \u2013 F43.23, if the symptoms are stress-related.\n\n5. Other specified anxiety disorder \u2013 F41.8, if the anxiety doesn't meet full criteria.\n\nBut she denies recent depression, so Major Depressive Disorder might be in remission. For current diagnosis, anxiety is more prominent.\n\nPerhaps:\n\n1. Gender Dysphoria \u2013 F64.9 (primary)\n\n2. Social Anxiety Disorder \u2013 F40.10 (secondary)\n\n3. Major Depressive Disorder, in full remission \u2013 F33.4 (secondary, historical)\n\n4. History of Suicidal Behavior \u2013 but no F-code, so skip.\n\n5. Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder \u2013 if related to discrimination or violence fears.\n\nShe mentions feeling vulnerable to aggression, which could be trauma-related, but no PTSD symptoms described.\n\nI think the most straightforward are Gender Dysphoria, Depressive Disorder, and Anxiety Disorder.\n\nTo have five, I can include diagnoses that are common comorbidities or rule-outs.\n\nBut the rubric says to consider less obvious possibilities, but in the response, I only list diagnoses, no reasoning.\n\nFor the list, I need to output only the structured list.\n\nLet's finalize:\n\nPrimary diagnosis: Gender Dysphoria, as it's the core issue.\n\nSecondary diagnoses:\n\n- Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in partial remission (since she still has some hopelessness but denies depression).\n\n- Social Anxiety Disorder.\n\n- Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety.\n\n- Perhaps Persistent Depressive Disorder, but not specified.\n\nAnother idea: She has a history of nonlethal suicide attempt, which could be under Suicidal Behavior Disorder in DSM-5-TR, but that's not a formal diagnosis; it's listed for further study. So, probably not.\n\nIn DSM-5-TR, there is Other Specified Depressive Disorder or Unspecified Anxiety Disorder if criteria aren't met.\n\nBut from the vignette, she meets criteria for Gender Dysphoria for sure. For depression, she had episodes with suicidal ideation and attempt, so likely Major Depressive Episode. For anxiety, worries about judgment, which could be Social Anxiety.\n\nSo, my list:\n\n1. Gender Dysphoria \u2013 F64.9\n\n2. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in remission \u2013 F33.4\n\n3. Social Anxiety Disorder \u2013 F40.10\n\n4. Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood \u2013 F43.23 (considering stressors from transition and social issues)\n\n5. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder \u2013 F41.8 (if Social Anxiety isn't full, but it seems to be)\n\nBut Adjustment Disorder might be overlapping with anxiety.\n\nPerhaps instead of Adjustment Disorder, include History of Suicide Attempt as a V-code, but that's not an F-code.\n\nI recall that in ICD-10, there is F43.20 Adjustment disorder, unspecified, which could be used.\n\nTo simplify, I'll go with the most evident.\n\nAfter re-reading: She denies recent depression, so Major Depressive Disorder might be in full remission. She says \"only infrequently felt hopeless and suicidal,\" so some residual symptoms, so partial remission.\n\nFor anxiety, \"worry that people were judging her negatively\" is less intense now, but still present, so Social Anxiety Disorder.\n\nShe also has a history of distress from gender incongruence, which is Gender Dysphoria.\n\nSo, for the list:\n\n1. Gender Dysphoria \u2013 F64.9 (Primary)\n\n2. Social Anxiety Disorder \u2013 F40.10\n\n3. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in partial remission \u2013 F33.41 (if partial remission, F33.41 is for in partial remission, I think. ICD-10 codes: F33.4 for recurrent depressive disorder in remission, unspecified, or F33.40 in remission, unspecified. To be precise, use F33.4).\n\n4. History of Suicidal Behavior \u2013 but no F-code, so instead, Persistent Depressive Disorder? No evidence.\n\n5. Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder \u2013 F43.8, for stressors like discrimination.\n\nBut I think four are enough. The instruction says top 5, so I need to list five.\n\nPerhaps include Anxiety Disorder Not Otherwise Specified, but DSM-5-TR uses Other Specified Anxiety Disorder.\n\nLet's check ICD-10 F-codes:\n\n- F64.9: Gender identity disorder, unspecified\n\n- F40.10: Social phobia, unspecified\n\n- F33.4: Recurrent depressive disorder, currently in remission\n\n- F41.1: Generalized anxiety disorder (if the worry is generalized, but it's specific to judgment)\n\n- F43.23: Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood\n\nFrom the vignette, she presented for anxiety and depression, so Adjustment Disorder could be considered as she is adjusting to post-transition life and social acceptance issues.\n\nI think Adjustment Disorder is plausible.\n\nSo, list:\n\n1. Gender Dysphoria \u2013 F64.9\n\n2. Social Anxiety Disorder \u2013 F40.10\n\n3. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in remission \u2013 F33.4\n\n4. Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety \u2013 F43.22 (Adjustment disorder with anxiety) or F43.23 with mixed anxiety and depression.\n\nShe has mixed anxiety and residual depressive symptoms, so F43.23.\n\n5. Other Specified Depressive Disorder \u2013 if the depression doesn't meet full criteria, but it seems it did in the past.\n\nTo have five, I'll include one more common comorbidity, like Substance Use Disorder, but no mention of substance use.\n\nPerhaps no fifth, but I must list five. So, I'll include a less specific one.\n\nAfter thinking, I recall that in transgender populations, there can be high rates of anxiety and depression, so listing both is fine.\n\nFor the primary diagnosis, it should be the most significant current issue. She is presenting for anxiety and depression, but the history shows Gender Dysphoria as the underlying cause. However, after transition, Gender Dysphoria might be resolved, and current issues are anxiety. But DSM-5-TR allows for Gender Dysphoria post-transition.\n\nIn the differential, I should consider that the anxiety and depression are symptoms of Gender Dysphoria, but they can be separate disorders.\n\nI think for the list, Gender Dysphoria is primary, and others are secondary.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n1. Gender Dysphoria \u2013 F64.9\n\n2. Social Anxiety Disorder \u2013 F40.10\n\n3. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in partial remission \u2013 F33.41 (using specific code for partial remission)\n\nIn ICD-10, for recurrent depressive disorder, partial remission is F33.42? Let me recall: ICD-10 codes for depression have fifth characters. For example, F33.4 is recurrent depressive disorder, currently in remission, and then .0 for mild, .1 for moderate, .2 for severe without psychotic symptoms, .3 for severe with psychotic symptoms, .4 for in remission. So F33.4 is for in remission, unspecified. To specify partial remission, it might be F33.42, but I think for simplicity, use F33.4.\n\nFrom ICD-10: F33.4 Recurrent depressive disorder, currently in remission. So I'll use F33.4.\n\nFor Social Anxiety Disorder, F40.10 is fine.\n\nFor Adjustment Disorder, F43.23.\n\nFor the fifth, perhaps Other Specified Anxiety Disorder or Unspecified Anxiety Disorder, but since Social Anxiety is listed, maybe another.\n\nI can include Past History of Suicide Attempt as a Z-code, but not F-code.\n\nPerhaps include No diagnosis on Axis I other than V codes, but that's not a diagnosis.\n\nI think I'll go with:\n\n1. Gender Dysphoria \u2013 F64.9\n\n2. Social Anxiety Disorder \u2013 F40.10\n\n3. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in remission \u2013 F33.4\n\n4. Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood \u2013 F43.23\n\n5. Other Specified Depressive Disorder \u2013 F32.89 (for past depressive episodes that don't meet full criteria, but they likely do)\n\nBut Other Specified Depressive Disorder is for when criteria are not met, so not appropriate.\n\nPerhaps Persistent Depressive Disorder, but no evidence of chronic depression for two years.\n\nShe had episodic depression from age 20 onwards, so recurrent is better.\n\nI think four are sufficient, but the instruction says five, so I'll add one more based on common comorbidities.\n\nIn transgender individuals, there can be increased risk for PTSD due to discrimination or violence, but no symptoms described, so not PTSD.\n\nShe mentions feeling vulnerable to aggression, but no trauma history given.\n\nSo, for the fifth, I'll include Anxiety Disorder Not Otherwise Specified, but in DSM-5-TR, it's Other Specified Anxiety Disorder or Unspecified Anxiety Disorder.\n\nTo be precise, since she has anxiety, but it might not meet full criteria for Social Anxiety, but it seems to.\n\nLet's say the worry is about judgment related to her gender, which could be part of Gender Dysphoria, so Social Anxiety might not be separate. But in differential, it's considered.\n\nI think for the purpose of this task, I'll list the most likely ones.\n\nUpon second thought, the primary diagnosis should be the reason for presentation. She presented for anxiety and depression, but after assessment, Gender Dysphoria is key. So in terms of current diagnoses, Gender Dysphoria might be ongoing, and anxiety is comorbid.\n\nI'll proceed with the list.\n\nFormat: \n\n1. <Primary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n\n2. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n\n3. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n\n4. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n\n5. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n\nSo:\n\n1. Gender Dysphoria \u2013 F64.9\n\n2. Social Anxiety Disorder \u2013 F40.10\n\n3. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in remission \u2013 F33.4\n\n4. Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood \u2013 F43.23\n\n5. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder \u2013 F41.8 (if the anxiety is not fully captured by Social Anxiety, but it likely is, so perhaps instead, History of Suicide Attempt as a supplementary code, but no F-code)\n\nI think Adjustment Disorder might cover the current stress-related symptoms.\n\nTo align with the vignette, she denies recent depression, so Major Depressive Disorder is in remission, and current anxiety is Social Anxiety or Adjustment.\n\nLet's see the last part: \"She said she tended to worry that people were judging her negatively, but this worry was less intense now than it had been earlier.\" So, it's a persistent worry, suggesting Social Anxiety Disorder.\n\nAnd she had depression in the past.\n\nSo, for five diagnoses, I'll include:\n\n- Gender Dysphoria\n\n- Social Anxiety Disorder\n\n- Major Depressive Disorder, in remission\n\n- Adjustment Disorder (for the stressors of transition and social acceptance)\n\n- And for the fifth, perhaps a V-code for history of suicide attempt, but since it says \"Do not include non-psychiatric diagnoses that do not use F-codes,\" I must use F-codes only.\n\nSo, I need to choose another F-code diagnosis. Possibly Unspecified Mood Disorder for residual symptoms, but not necessary.\n\nI think I'll list:\n\n1. Gender Dysphoria \u2013 F64.9\n\n2. Social Anxiety Disorder \u2013 F40.10\n\n3. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in remission \u2013 F33.4\n\n4. Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety \u2013 F43.22\n\n5. Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder \u2013 F43.8 (for the distress related to discrimination and violence fears)\n\nBut Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder might be appropriate if she has symptoms not meeting PTSD criteria.\n\nShe doesn't describe trauma symptoms, so perhaps not.\n\nAnother idea: Since she has a history of suicide attempt, and in DSM-5-TR, there is Suicidal Behavior Disorder for further study, but not official. In ICD-10, there is X84 for intentional self-harm by unspecified means, but not an F-code.\n\nI think for clinical purposes, the top diagnoses are Gender Dysphoria, Depression, and Anxiety. To have five, I can list subtypes or specifiers, but that's not separate diagnoses.\n\nPerhaps include Persistent Depressive Disorder if the depression was chronic, but it seems episodic.\n\nLet's read again: \"felt increasingly hopeless\" from age 20, with episodic suicidal ideation, so it might be recurrent major depression.\n\nAt age 25, she \"only infrequently felt hopeless and suicidal,\" so some residual symptoms.\n\nSo, Major Depressive Disorder in partial remission.\n\nFor anxiety, Social Anxiety Disorder.\n\nAnd Gender Dysphoria.\n\nThat's three. For the fourth, Adjustment Disorder, and for the fifth, I'll add a diagnosis that is common in such cases, like Other Specified Anxiety Disorder.\n\nI recall that in the vignette, she \"explored her sexuality,\" but no disorder related to sexuality is mentioned; she identifies as heterosexual female.\n\nSo, I'll go with the list above.\n\nFinal list:\n\n1. Gender Dysphoria - F64.9\n\n2. Social Anxiety Disorder - F40.10\n\n3. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in partial remission - F33.41 (assuming partial remission)\n\nIn ICD-10, for recurrent depressive disorder, partial remission is coded with the fourth character. F33.4 is for in remission, and then fifth character for severity. But in clinical practice, F33.4 is often used for in remission. To be specific, I can use F33.4 without specifying severity.\n\nUpon quick check: ICD-10 code for recurrent depressive disorder, current episode in partial remission is F33.42 if severe without psychotic symptoms, but since not specified, use F33.4.\n\nI'll use F33.4 for simplicity.\n\n4. Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood - F43.23\n\n5. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder - F41.8\n\nBut Other Specified Anxiety Disorder might be redundant if Social Anxiety is listed. Instead, I can include History of Suicidal Behavior as a Z-code, but since not F-code, I'll skip.\n\nPerhaps include Unspecified Depressive Disorder for past episodes, but Major Depressive Disorder covers it.\n\nI think I'll stick with four and add a fifth that is less likely but possible, like Generalized Anxiety Disorder, but the worry is specific to social judgment.\n\nShe said she \"tended to worry,\" which might be generalized, but it's about people judging, so social.\n\nSo, for the fifth, I'll include Generalized Anxiety Disorder, F41.1.\n\nFrom the vignette: \"She said she tended to worry that people were judging her negatively,\" which is a specific worry, not generalized to multiple things, so Social Anxiety is better.\n\nTo have five, I'll include both Social Anxiety and Generalized Anxiety, but that might not be accurate.\n\nAnother thought: She has a history of nonlethal suicide attempt, which can be coded under Suicidal ideation or behavior as a symptom, not a diagnosis.\n\nI think for the purpose of this response, I'll provide five diagnoses based on common practice.\n\nLet's look at the vignette again: She presented to a psychiatrist because of anxiety and depression. So, the current reasons are anxiety and depression. After history, the diagnoses might include Gender Dysphoria as a historical or ongoing condition.\n\nIn terms of current diagnoses, she might have Anxiety Disorder NOS and Depressive Disorder NOS, but with history, more specific.\n\nI think the primary diagnosis should be the one that is most significant for her care. Since she has undergone transition, Gender Dysphoria might be the reason for past distress, and current anxiety is the focus.\n\nBut in the list, Gender Dysphoria is listed as a diagnosis.\n\nPerhaps the primary diagnosis is Social Anxiety Disorder, and secondary is Gender Dysphoria, but Gender Dysphoria seems central.\n\nI think Gender Dysphoria is primary.\n\nI'll proceed with the list as follows:\n\n1. Gender Dysphoria - F64.9\n\n2. Social Anxiety Disorder - F40.10\n\n3. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in remission - F33.4\n\n4. Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety - F43.22\n\n5. Other Specified Depressive Disorder - F32.89 (for residual depressive symptoms)\n\nBut Other Specified Depressive Disorder is for when criteria are not met for major depression, but she met criteria in the past, so in remission, it's Major Depressive Disorder.\n\nSo, I'll use Major Depressive Disorder in remission.\n\nI think this is acceptable.\n\nNow, for the response, I need to output only the structured list, no reasoning.\n\nSo, my final answer will be:\n\n1. Gender Dysphoria - F64.9\n\n2. Social Anxiety Disorder - F40.10\n\n3. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in remission - F33.4\n\n4. Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood - F43.23\n\n5. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder - F41.8\n\nTo make it more accurate, I'll replace Other Specified Anxiety Disorder with something else if possible, but I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps instead, include History of Suicide Attempt as a supplementary diagnosis with a Z-code, but instruction says F-codes only, so not.\n\nI'll go with this.",

    "vignette":"Kyle was a 12-year-old boy who reluctantly agreed to admission to a psychiatric unit after getting arrested for breaking into a grocery store. His mother said she was \u201cexhausted,\u201d adding that it was hard to raise a boy who \u201cdoesn\u2019t know the rules.\u201d\n\nBeginning as a young child, Kyle was unusually aggressive, bullying other children and taking their things. When confronted by his mother, stepfather, or a teacher, he had long tended to curse, punch, and show no concern for possible punishment. Disruptive, impulsive, and \u201cfidgety,\u201d Kyle was diagnosed with attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and placed in a special education program by second grade. He began to see a psychiatrist in fourth grade for weekly psychotherapy and medications (quetiapine and dexmethylphenidate). He was adherent only sporadically with both the medication and the therapy. When asked why this was, he replied that his psychiatrist was \u201cstupid.\u201d\n\nDuring the year prior to the admission, he had been caught stealing from school lockers (a cell phone, a jacket, a laptop computer), disciplined after \u201cmugging\u201d a classmate for his wallet, and suspended after multiple physical fights with classmates. He had been arrested twice for these behaviors. His mother and teachers agreed that although he could be charming to strangers, people quickly caught on to the fact that he was a \u201ccon artist.\u201d Kyle was consistently unremorseful, externalizing of blame, and uninterested in the feelings of others. He was disorganized, was inattentive and uninterested in following instructions, and constantly lost his possessions. He generally did not do his homework, and when he did, his performance was erratic. When confronted about his poor performance, he tended to say, \u201cAnd what are you going to do, shoot me?\u201d Kyle, his mother, and his teachers agreed that he was a loner and not well liked by his peers.\n\nKyle lived with his mother, stepfather, and two younger half-siblings. His stepfather was unemployed, and his mother worked part-time as a cashier in a grocery store. His biological father was in prison for drug possession. Both biological grandfathers had a history of alcohol use disorder.\n\nKyle\u2019s early history was normal. The pregnancy was uneventful, and he reached all of his milestones on time. There was no history of sexual or physical abuse. Kyle had no known medical problems, alcohol or substance abuse, or participation in gang activities. He had not been caught with weapons, had not set fires, and had not been seen as particularly cruel to other children or animals. He had been regularly truant from school but had neither run away nor stayed away from home until late at night.\n\nWhen interviewed on the psychiatric unit, Kyle was casually groomed and appeared his stated age of 12. He was fidgety and made sporadic eye contact with the interviewer. He said he was \u201cmad\u201d and insisted he would rather be in jail than on a psychiatric unit. His speech was loud but coherent, goal directed, and of normal rate. His affect was irritable and angry. He denied suicidal or homicidal ideation. He denied psychotic symptoms. He denied feeling depressed. He had no obvious cognitive deficits but declined more formal testing. His insight was limited, and his judgment was poor by history.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, the user wants me to act as an expert psychiatrist and diagnose this 12-year-old boy, Kyle, based on the DSM-5-TR criteria. I need to follow the provided rubric at Level 5 for both data extraction and diagnostic reasoning. But the user specifically asked not to output any clinical reasoning, just the structured list of diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes. So internally, I'll reason through it carefully, but the final response should only contain the list.\n\nFirst, I'll extract all relevant clinical information from the vignette. Kyle has a long history of aggressive, disruptive behavior since childhood. He bullies others, steals, and shows no remorse. He's been diagnosed with ADHD and is on medication but is non-adherent. There's mention of impulsivity, fidgetiness, inattention, disorganization\u2014all aligning with ADHD. However, the core issue seems to be a persistent pattern of violating others' rights and societal norms, lack of empathy, deceitfulness, and aggression. That points towards Conduct Disorder. The vignette specifies he hasn't been cruel to animals or set fires, so maybe some criteria aren't met, but enough are present for a diagnosis.\n\nHe also shows signs of antisocial traits\u2014charming but manipulative (\"con artist\"), externalizing blame, no concern for punishment. Since he's under 18, it can't be Antisocial Personality Disorder, but Conduct Disorder is the childhood equivalent. Oppositional Defiant Disorder might be considered, but the behaviors go beyond defiance into serious violations like stealing and physical aggression, so Conduct Disorder takes precedence.\n\nADHD is clearly stated in the vignette, so that's a solid secondary diagnosis. The impulsivity and inattention contribute to his behavioral issues. \n\nGiven the family history\u2014biological father in prison, grandfathers with alcohol use disorder\u2014there might be a genetic predisposition to disruptive behaviors. But no substance use is reported in Kyle himself.\n\nHe's described as a loner, not well-liked, but no clear symptoms of depression or anxiety. He denies feeling depressed and has no psychotic symptoms. So mood disorders seem less likely. \n\nThe vignette mentions he's unremorseful, uninterested in others' feelings, and manipulative. Those are callous-unemotional traits, which could specifier for Conduct Disorder with limited prosocial emotions. But the user didn't ask for specifiers, just the diagnosis and F-code.\n\nNow, for the differential: Conduct Disorder is primary. ADHD is secondary. Oppositional Defiant Disorder might be ruled out due to severity, but it could be a comorbid condition. However, DSM-5 notes that if criteria for Conduct Disorder are met, ODD isn't diagnosed separately. So maybe not. \n\nOther possibilities? Intermittent Explosive Disorder? But the aggression here is part of a broader pattern, not just episodic outbursts. No mention of explosive anger episodes specifically. \n\nAdjustment disorder? The behaviors are long-standing, not in response to a recent stressor. \n\nParent-child relational problem? Possibly, but the issue seems more intrinsic to Kyle's behavior. \n\nFinally, given the family dysfunction and potential environmental factors, Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder could be a catch-all, but Conduct Disorder fits best.\n\nSo, my top five: \n1. Conduct Disorder, Childhood-onset type (since behaviors started before age 10) - F91.1\n2. Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder, Combined Presentation (inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms) - F90.2\n3. Oppositional Defiant Disorder? But as above, might not be separate. Maybe Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder if some criteria aren't met, but they seem to be.\nWait, re-reading: He has aggression, deceitfulness, theft, serious rule violations. That's at least three criteria for Conduct Disorder. So yes, F91.1.\n\nFor secondary diagnoses, besides ADHD, perhaps Unspecified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder as a backup, but that's vague. Maybe rule out mood disorders, but no evidence. \n\nThe user wants five diagnoses. So I'll list Conduct Disorder as primary, ADHD as secondary, and then consider other possibilities like ODD (though not typically comorbid if Conduct Disorder is present), Adjustment Disorder, or Relational problems. But the vignette doesn't support mood or anxiety disorders. \n\nPerhaps Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder? No history of neglect or disrupted caregiving. \n\nReactive Attachment Disorder? Same issue. \n\nSubstance use? Not mentioned. \n\nSo, sticking to the most likely: Conduct Disorder, ADHD, and maybe ODD as a residual if some argue it's still applicable. But DSM-5 says if Conduct Disorder is present, ODD isn't diagnosed unless the ODD symptoms predate Conduct Disorder and are still present. The vignette says he was aggressive and bullying since young child, which could include ODD traits. But I think Conduct Disorder encompasses it. \n\nMaybe Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder with limited prosocial emotions? But again, specifier isn't a separate diagnosis. \n\nI'll go with:\n1. Conduct Disorder, Childhood-Onset Type - F91.1\n2. Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder, Combined Presentation - F90.2\n3. Oppositional Defiant Disorder - F91.3 (if considered separately)\n4. Parent-Child Relational Problem - Z62.820 (but that's a Z-code, not an F-code, so not psychiatric per se. The user said only F-codes, so skip.)\nHmm, need other F-code diagnoses. Maybe Unspecified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder - F91.9 as a placeholder, but not ideal.\n\nMaybe No Diagnosis? But clearly there are diagnoses. \n\nAfter rethinking: The vignette emphasizes lack of remorse, deceit, aggression, rule-breaking. Conduct Disorder is primary. ADHD is comorbid. For other secondary, perhaps Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder if there's uncertainty, but I think Conduct Disorder is clear. \n\nMaybe Prolonged Grief Disorder? No. \n\nAdjustment Disorder? No identifiable stressor. \n\nAnxiety disorders? No. \n\nSo, I'll list:\n1. Conduct Disorder - F91.1\n2. ADHD - F90.2\n3. Oppositional Defiant Disorder - F91.3 (though may be subsumed)\n4. Unspecified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder - F91.9 (as a less likely alternative)\n5. Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder - F91.8\n\nBut that's redundant. Better to include other categories. Perhaps Risk Factors like Family History, but not diagnoses. \n\nThe user said \"secondary diagnoses,\" meaning other psychiatric conditions that may be present. So besides Conduct Disorder and ADHD, what else? Maybe Rule-Outs: Intermittent Explosive Disorder (F63.81), but no episodic outbursts described. Or Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (F34.81), but he denies depression and hasn't persistent irritability? He has irritable affect but not per DMDD criteria. \n\nGiven the limited info, I'll stick with the most evidence-based.",

    "vignette":"Lucas Sandahl, a 32-year-old landscape architect, presented to a psychiatrist for help with anger. He came to the office with his wife, the mother of their two young children. The couple agreed that Mr. Sandahl had become \u201calmost impossible to live with.\u201d Mrs. Sandahl reported that although she had always considered her husband \u201chigh-strung,\u201d his outbursts were increasing in both frequency and intensity, and she worried that he would become violent with her.\n\nTheir most recent argument began when Mr. Sandahl came home after a \u201chard day at work\u201d to find that dinner was not ready. When he entered the kitchen and saw his wife sitting at the table reading the newspaper, he \u201cexploded\u201d and launched into a tirade about how \u201cbad\u201d a wife she was. When Mrs. Sandahl tried to explain her own long day, Mr. Sandahl cursed at her and broke glassware and a kitchen chair. Terrified, she ran out of the kitchen, gathered up the toddlers, and left for her mother\u2019s house a few miles away. The next day, she told her husband that he would need to get help immediately or prepare for a divorce.\n\nMr. Sandahl said his \u201cblowups\u201d began in childhood but did not become \u201cproblematic\u201d for him until age 13. At about that time, he started having frequent fights with classmates that would occasionally result in trips to the principal\u2019s office. In between the altercations, he was active socially and a solid student.\n\nMr. Sandahl estimated that he had had approximately four verbal outbursts a week in recent years, generally in response to frustration, unexpected demands, or perceived insults. In addition to these heated verbal tussles, Mr. Sandahl described acts of violence about every 2 months; for example, he threw a computer monitor across the room when it started \u201cacting up,\u201d he kicked a hole in a wall when one of his children would not quit crying, and he destroyed his mobile phone during an argument with his mother. He denied physical fights since his adolescence, although he had nearly come to blows with a neighbor as well as an assortment of strangers and employees. The idea that he might physically hurt someone scared Mr. Sandahl \u201cto the core.\u201d\n\nThese outbursts blighted his relationships with colleagues and romantic partners and led to his decision to start his own landscaping company at age 25. The business had done well, despite his demanding style and \u201chair-trigger\u201d temper that led to high employee turnover.\n\nMr. Sandahl described the episodes as short-lived, reaching a peak within seconds and rarely lasting more than a few minutes. Between episodes, he described himself as feeling \u201cfine.\u201d He had experienced brief periods of depressed mood and increased anxiety, but these had not impaired him significantly and tended to resolve on their own within a week. Mr. Sandahl drank socially, but neither he nor his wife linked the outbursts to the alcohol. He had a history of experimentation with various drugs of abuse, but not in recent years.\n\nMr. Sandahl reported at least two other immediate family members with significant \u201canger issues.\u201d His father was emotionally abusive and perfectionistic, expecting \u201cgreat things\u201d from his only son. Mr. Sandahl\u2019s older sister also had problems with her temper; he attributed her three divorces to her emotionally abusive behavior.\n\nOn examination, Mr. Sandahl was casually dressed, cooperative, and coherent. He was worried about his behavior and contrite toward his wife. He denied depression, psychosis, and confusion. He denied any thoughts of hurting himself or others. He was cognitively intact. His insight and judgment were good during the course of the interview.",

    "model_thoughts":"Hmm, this is a complex clinical case requiring careful diagnostic reasoning. The patient presents with chronic, severe anger issues dating back to adolescence, characterized by frequent verbal outbursts and periodic destructive behavior. \n\nThe key features to consider are the recurrent behavioral outbursts representing failure to control aggressive impulses, the onset in adolescence, the significant distress and impairment in relationships and work, and the absence of other primary mental disorders that better explain the symptoms. The intermittent nature with normal functioning between episodes rules out persistent mood or psychotic disorders.\n\nThe diagnostic process involves evaluating against DSM-5-TR criteria for intermittent explosive disorder, which seems to fit best given the pattern of disproportionate aggressive outbursts. Need to consider differentials like personality disorders (particularly borderline or antisocial), but the absence of pervasive interpersonal pattern argues against this. Substance use doesn't appear to be a factor currently. The episodic anxiety and depression seem secondary to the anger issues rather than primary disorders.\n\nThe family history of similar issues supports the diagnosis.

    "vignette":"Matthew Tucker, a 45-year-old married European American plumber, was referred for a psychiatric evaluation after his family carried out an intervention to express their concern that his alcohol problems were getting out of control. Mr. Tucker denied having had a drink since making the appointment 3 days earlier.\n\nFor 20 years after high school, Mr. Tucker typically drank 3\u20135 beers per evening, five times per week. Over the last 7 years, he had consumed alcohol almost daily, with an average of 6 beers on weeknights and 12 beers on weekends and holidays. His wife repeatedly voiced her concern that he was \u201cdrinking too much,\u201d but despite his efforts to limit his alcohol intake, Mr. Tucker continued to spend much of the weekend drinking, sometimes missing family get-togethers, and often passed out while watching TV in the evening. He remained productive at work, however, and never called in sick. In many ways, his history represented what is typically seen in alcohol use disorder. Mr. Tucker had achieved two 30-day periods of abstinence in the previous 4 years. Both times, he said he had quit drinking \u201ccold turkey\u201d in response to his wife\u2019s concerns. He denied having had symptoms of alcohol withdrawal either time.\n\nIn the 6 months prior to the evaluation, Mr. Tucker had become uncharacteristically irritable, fatigued, dysphoric, and worried. He was unable to enjoy his usual activities, including food and sex, and had difficulty concentrating. He also reacted more emotionally to stresses and expressed unsubstantiated concern about the future of his business. The patient often awoke at 2:00 a.m. and had trouble getting back to sleep.\n\nMr. Tucker and his wife indicated that although this period of sadness had lasted 6 months, he had experienced several similar episodes in the prior 5 years, lasting 4\u20136 weeks each. They denied any such episodes earlier in his life.\n\nMr. Tucker had been married for 18 years, and he and his wife had one 17-year-old daughter. The patient was a high school graduate with 2 years of community college who currently owned a successful plumbing company. He denied any other history of psychiatric or medical problems, as well as any history of mania or suicide attempts. He had never seen a psychiatrist before.\n\nAt a recent annual checkup, Mr. Tucker\u2019s internist noted a mildly elevated blood pressure (135\/92), a \u03b3-glutamyltransferase (GGT) value of 47 IU\/L, and a mean corpuscular volume of 92.5 \u03bcm3. All other laboratory results were in the normal range.\n\nAt the time of his first visit, Mr. Tucker was neatly dressed, maintained good eye contact, and showed no evidence of confusion or psychotic symptoms. His eyes teared up when he talked about the future, and he admitted to having felt sad for most of the day on a regular basis for the last 6 months, but he denied suicidal ideation or plans. His cognition was within normal limits, and he demonstrated an understanding of the effects that the alcohol was having on him.\n\nA physical examination by the psychiatrist revealed a normal pulse rate, no tremor or sweating, and only a slightly elevated blood pressure.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, the user is presenting a clinical case vignette and asking for a structured list of DSM-5-TR diagnoses based on the information provided. I need to carefully extract the key details from the vignette to ensure accurate diagnosis.\n\nFirst, the patient has a long history of heavy alcohol use, with increasing consumption over the years. He shows patterns of tolerance, unsuccessful attempts to cut down, and continued use despite social consequences like missing family events. This strongly suggests Alcohol Use Disorder. The severity seems moderate to severe given the quantity and duration.\n\nNext, there's a 6-month episode of depressive symptoms: dysphoria, anhedonia, irritability, sleep disturbances, concentration issues, and excessive worry. These episodes have occurred multiple times in the past 5 years, each lasting 4-6 weeks. No history of mania or hypomania is noted. This pattern fits Persistent Depressive Disorder (dysthymia) with intermittent major depressive episodes, but the current episode meets criteria for Major Depressive Disorder due to its duration and severity.\n\nThe patient also exhibits excessive worry about his business and general future, along with irritability and sleep disturbances. While some anxiety symptoms overlap with depression, the chronic worry and physical symptoms might indicate Generalized Anxiety Disorder. However, the vignette doesn't specify whether the worry is uncontrollable or accompanied by other GAD criteria beyond what's listed.\n\nConsidering differentials: Adjustment Disorder is less likely given the chronicity and lack of an identified stressor. Bipolar disorder is ruled out due to no history of manic episodes. Substance-induced depressive disorder is possible but the depressive episodes occurred even during abstinence periods, making it less likely.\n\nThe physical findings like elevated GGT and MCV support chronic alcohol use but aren't diagnostic on their own. No psychotic features are present.\n\nPrioritizing the diagnoses: Alcohol Use Disorder is primary given its chronicity and impact. Major Depressive Disorder is secondary due to the current severe episode. Persistent Depressive Disorder accounts for the underlying chronic low-grade symptoms. Generalized Anxiety Disorder is included due to prominent worry. Substance\/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder is listed as a rule-out given the alcohol use history.\n\nI'll structure the output as requested: primary diagnosis first, then four secondaries with corresponding F-codes.

    "vignette":"Nicholas Underwood, a 41-year-old married software engineer, entered an alcohol treatment program with this chief complaint: \u201cI need to stop drinking or my wife will divorce me.\u201d\n\nAt the time of admission, Mr. Underwood stated that he was drinking approximately 1 liter of vodka per day, every day, and had not had an alcohol-free day in over 2 years. For many years, Mr. Underwood had drunk alcohol only after work, but about a year prior to the evaluation he had begun to routinely drink in the morning whenever he had the day off. More recently, he had begun to feel \u201cshaky\u201d every morning and would sometimes treat that sensation with a drink, followed by more alcohol during the day.\n\nMr. Underwood experienced a number of problems related to drinking. His wife was \u201cat the end of her rope\u201d and considering divorce. His diminished ability to concentrate at work was \u201csinking\u201d his once-promising career. He was spending more time trying to recover from the effects of drinking and found himself planning strategies both for abstinence and for surreptitiously taking his next drink.\n\nMr. Underwood first tried alcohol in high school and said that he had always been able to hold his liquor more than his friends could. In college, he was one of the heaviest drinkers in a fraternity known as \u201cAnimal House\u201d around campus. Through his 30s, he gradually increased the frequency of his drinking from primarily on weekends to daily. Over the prior year, he had switched from being exclusively a beer drinker to drinking vodka. He had gone to many Alcoholics Anonymous meetings over the years but tended to drink as soon as the meeting ended. He had received no formal treatment.\n\nThe patient denied recent use of other substances; he had smoked marijuana and snorted cocaine several times during college but never since. He had used no other illicit drugs and took no medications. He did not smoke cigarettes. He had experienced blackouts on several occasions during college but not since then. He had no history of seizures and no other medical problems. Family history was significant for alcohol use disorder in his father and paternal grandfather.\n\nMr. Underwood entered the alcohol treatment program at approximately 3:00 p.m., having not had a drink since the evening before. He was diaphoretic and exhibited significant tremulousness in his hands. He complained of anxiety, restlessness, irritability, nausea, and recent insomnia.\n\nClinical evaluation revealed a casually groomed, diaphoretic man who was cooperative but anxiously pacing and who immediately said, \u201cI\u2019m getting ready to jump out of my skin.\u201d Speech was of normal rate, rhythm, and tone. He denied depression. There was no evidence of psychotic thinking, and he denied auditory, visual, or tactile hallucinations. He was alert and oriented to person, place, and date. He had no gross memory deficits, but his attention and concentration were noted to be reduced.\n\nNotable features of his physical examination were marked diaphoresis, a blood pressure of 155\/95, a heart rate of 104 beats\/minute, severe tremulousness in his upper extremities, and hyperactive deep tendon reflexes throughout. Laboratory test findings were within normal limits except for aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, which were approximately 3 times normal.",

    "vignette":"Oliver Vincent had never seen himself as being an addict. He had always been \u201con top of things.\u201d At age 35, he was independently wealthy as the owner of several clothing franchises, lived with an ex-partner in a more-than-comfortable apartment in New York City, worked out every day, enjoyed the company of a group of loving friends, and, although single, had not given up on the idea of someday (preferably soon) finding the perfect man to share his life with. Mr. Vincent came out to his Irish Catholic family when he was 19. His parents had already guessed that Mr. Vincent was gay long before he told them, and they took the non-news fairly well. Their main concern had been that their son might be discriminated against because of his sexuality, get hurt, and live a lonely life. Nothing could be farther from the way things turned out: Mr. Vincent was \u201cout and proud\u201d and living it up.\n\nWhen Mr. Vincent found himself with a substance use problem, he addressed it the same way he had dealt with pretty much everything else: head on. For the first time in his life, he decided to see a psychiatrist.\n\nMr. Vincent described a pattern that revolved around weekend \u201cparty and play\u201d activities. On Friday and Saturday evenings\u2014and occasionally during the week\u2014he would go out to dinner with friends and then to a club or a private party. He tended to drink two or three cocktails and four to five glasses of wine during the evening. Without the alcohol, he found he could easily say \u201cno\u201d to substances, but \u201cafter a good buzz, if someone has coke\u2014and there is always someone around who has coke\u2014I use. And then my heart starts to race, and then I do everything I can to hook up. I used to go online, but these days, it\u2019s all on Scruff and good ol\u2019 Grindr.\u201d\n\nParty and play are classic code words for drugs and sex, respectively. The term is sometimes abbreviated PNP.\n\nScruff and Grindr are smartphone applications that use GPS to identify and connect similarly inclined individuals in a person\u2019s geographical vicinity.\n\nOverall, Mr. Vincent drank alcohol and used cocaine three to four times a week and \u201coccasionally used Tina and bath salts.\u201d He could hardly attend Monday morning meetings, much less prepare for them, and had been trying to cut down on his cocaine use for the prior 6 months without success.\n\nTina is slang for crystal methamphetamine (i.e., from crystal to Christina to Tina). Bath salts is slang for a powder that contains a variety of synthetic stimulants (e.g., cathinone derivatives).\n\nSince Mr. Vincent had started using cocaine regularly, he had lost weight and had trouble sleeping. He worried that his effort at the gym was going to waste. His business continued to succeed, but his own effectiveness had decreased. Most importantly, he did not practice safer sex when high on stimulants, and because he did not want to be on a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) regimen, he worried about HIV seroconversion.",

    "model_thoughts":"Hmm, this is a clinical case requiring psychiatric diagnosis based on DSM-5-TR criteria. The user has provided a detailed vignette about Oliver Vincent and expects a structured list of diagnoses with ICD-10 codes. \n\nFirst, I need to extract key clinical information. Oliver is a 35-year-old gay man with a pattern of weekend \"party and play\" involving alcohol, cocaine, crystal meth, and synthetic stimulants. He drinks heavily (2-3 cocktails plus 4-5 glasses of wine) and uses cocaine 3-4 times weekly. He's tried to cut down without success, experiences functional impairment (misses work, decreased effectiveness), and engages in risky sexual behavior when intoxicated. There's no mention of withdrawal symptoms, but tolerance is implied by frequent use. The timeline shows this pattern has persisted for at least 6 months.\n\nFor diagnostic reasoning, the primary issue is substance use. Cocaine use disorder appears most prominent given the frequency, failed attempts to cut down, and functional consequences. Alcohol use disorder is also likely due to heavy drinking patterns. Stimulant use disorder (for methamphetamine and bath salts) should be considered given the poly-substance use. The risky sexual behavior under intoxication isn't a standalone diagnosis but supports substance use disorders. No clear mood or anxiety symptoms are described, so those aren't prioritized.\n\nThe differential should focus on substance-related diagnoses since they're most supported by the vignette. I'll list cocaine use disorder as primary due to its central role, followed by alcohol use disorder, then other stimulant use disorders.

His mother gave him several tablets of hydrocodone-acetaminophen that she had for back pain, and he found this helpful. When he ran out of the pills and his pain persisted, he went to the emergency room. He was told he had a mild sprain. He was given a 1-month supply of hydrocodone-acetaminophen. He took the pills as prescribed for 1 month, and his pain resolved.\n\nAfter stopping the pills, however, Mr. Winters began to experience a recurrence of the pain in his knee. He saw an orthopedist, who ordered imaging studies and determined that there was no structural damage. Mr. Winters was given another 1-month supply of hydrocodone-acetaminophen. This time, however, he needed to take more than prescribed in order to ease the pain. He also felt dysphoric and \u201cachy\u201d when he abstained from taking the medication, and described a \u201ccraving\u201d for more opioids. He returned to the orthopedist, who referred him to a pain specialist.\n\nMr. Winters was too embarrassed to go to the pain specialist, believing that his faith and strength should help him overcome the pain. He found it impossible to live without the pain medication, however, because of the pain, dysphoria, and muscle aches when he stopped the medication. He also began to \u201cenjoy the high\u201d and experienced intense craving. He began to frequent emergency rooms to receive more opioids, often lying about the timing and nature of his right knee pain, and even stole pills from his mother on two occasions. He became preoccupied with trying to find more opioids, and his work and home life suffered. He endorsed low mood, especially when contemplating the impact of opioids on his life, but denied any other mood or neurovegetative symptoms. Eventually, he told his primary care doctor about his opioid use and low mood, and that doctor referred him to the outpatient psychiatry clinic.\n\nMr. Winters had a history of two lifetime major depressive episodes that were treated successfully with escitalopram by his primary care doctor. He also had a history of an alcohol use disorder when he was in his 20s. He managed to quit using alcohol on his own after a family intervention. He smoked two packs of cigarettes daily. His father suffered from depression, and \u201calmost everyone\u201d on his mother\u2019s side of the family had \u201cissues with addiction.\u201d He had been married to his wife for 20 years, and they had two school-age children. He had been a minister in his church for 15 years. Results of a recent physical examination and laboratory testing performed by his primary care physician had been within normal limits.\n\nOn mental status examination, Mr. Winters was cooperative and did not exhibit any psychomotor abnormalities. He answered most questions briefly, often simply saying \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d Speech was of a normal rate and tone, without tangentiality or circumstantiality.

At the time of the appointment, he had been without a permanent home for over 6 months. He had lived in various places, including his car and friends\u2019 homes. For over 1 month prior to presentation, he had been living in a tent in the woods. He had called his parents on his recent birthday, and they had offered to pay for substance use disorder treatment as long as they could pay directly.\n\nMr. Xavier reported that his problem started at age 24, when he had a new wife and young child and had taken on two jobs to make ends meet (working in a factory and as a local delivery driver). When he injured his back and could not get to work because of the pain, a friend offered him a few tablets of acetaminophen-oxycodone (Percocet). Not only did his pain disappear, but his energy and mood improved. For the first time in his life, he felt \u201cnormal and happy.\u201d\n\nMr. Xavier continued to use one to four Percocet tablets per day for 1\u00bd years. He never took more than one pill at a time. Then, at age 26, he snorted half a bag of heroin (about $5 on the street). \u201cIt took about 10 minutes, but I was transported into an indescribable euphoria. Like taking that first Percocet times 10.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. You chase that first feeling for the rest of your life. It never repeats.\u201d Within months of starting heroin, he began using it intravenously in an effort to glimpse the euphoria again.\n\nAfter that first experience with heroin, the progression of use was rapid. Within 6 months, Mr. Xavier was unemployed, separated from his family, and homeless. \u201cI was sleeping in my car or on the streets\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009using up to 30 bags [$300] daily.\u201d\n\nMr. Xavier began to reach out for help. He enrolled in outpatient rehabilitation for opioid users. The cravings to use, even while in treatment, were intense. Mr. Xavier reported multiple relapses. He added cocaine to the heroin injections, and \u201cspeedballs\u201d became Mr. Xavier\u2019s drug of choice for a while, but he then returned to using only heroin. The first of multiple accidental overdoses occurred in a vacant house when he was 27. He had been admitted to \u201cabout 10 detoxes and rehabs\u201d but would typically relapse within hours or weeks of discharge. He had also gone sporadically to Narcotics Anonymous meetings for years.\n\nTo acquire money for his habit, he broke into homes, stole from relatives, and wrote bad checks. \u201cEvery penny went to drugs. I\u2019m lucky not to be in prison, but not so lucky in that everybody hates me.\u201d\n\nHe decided to move to Martha\u2019s Vineyard a year prior to the consultation because it \u201csounded like a quiet place.\u201d He brought some methadone with him, but the eventual withdrawal was \u201cfierce.\u201d\n\nHe continued to use heroin and oxycodone when he could easily get them. Otherwise, he drank alcohol heavily, although he said, \u201cI need to stop drinking\u2014that\u2019s what really gets me in trouble.\u201d He also took diazepam (Valium) sporadically; however, he did not consider that to be a problem but more of a way to get through the day.\n\nHe worked occasionally as a landscaper. His boss\u2014someone he had met at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting\u2014had made it clear that he would call when there was extra work to be done, but that until Mr. Xavier got clean, the boss would not actually expect him to show up. He had held a variety of other odd jobs, including office supplies salesman, veterinary assistant, and gas station attendant. He had not seen his daughter in over 2 years.\n\nOn examination, Mr. Xavier appeared somewhat unkempt. He was generally cooperative but appeared restless, and at one point he urgently left the room; when he returned, he reported that he was experiencing bouts of diarrhea. His pupils were enlarged and his skin was remarkable for sweating and piloerection. He yawned several times and appeared irritable and unhappy. His arms and legs frequently twitched. He repeatedly blew his nose and appeared tearful. His speech was rapid, and he appeared impatient. He denied psychotic symptoms, suicidality, and homicidality. He said he was hopeful that if he could get some Suboxone (buprenorphine and naloxone), he might be able to keep a job and maybe get to be a real father.\n\nLaboratory studies were negative for HIV and hepatitis A, B, and C.",

    "model_thoughts":"Hmm, this is a complex clinical vignette requiring careful analysis. The patient presents with clear substance use issues, particularly opioids, but there are multiple layers to consider. The rubric emphasizes sophisticated data extraction and diagnostic reasoning, so I need to ensure my response reflects expert-level clinical thinking even though the output is just the diagnosis list.\n\nFirst, extracting key data: The patient has a history of opioid use disorder with progression from prescription opioids to heroin, intravenous use, and polysubstance involvement including cocaine and alcohol. There's significant functional impairment - homelessness, job instability, legal problems, and family estrangement. The physical exam shows objective signs of opioid withdrawal (pilorection, sweating, diarrhea, pupil dilation). He also reports using alcohol heavily and diazepam sporadically.\n\nFor diagnostic reasoning, the primary diagnosis seems straightforward - severe opioid use disorder given the compulsive use, tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, and severe life consequences. But I should consider other substance use disorders too. The alcohol use sounds problematic given his comment about it causing trouble, likely alcohol use disorder. Diazepam use might indicate sedative use disorder, though it's described as sporadic. The cocaine use history warrants stimulant use disorder consideration.\n\nInterestingly, there's no mention of primary mood or anxiety disorders - the distress appears secondary to substance use. The \"normal and happy\" feeling with initial opioid use suggests substance-induced euphoria rather than pre-existing depression. No psychotic symptoms reported. So substance-induced disorders seem less likely than primary substance use disorders.\n\nFor the differential, I should prioritize by severity and immediacy. Opioid withdrawal is an active issue, but it's part of the opioid use disorder rather than separate. The polysubstance use suggests multiple substance use disorders should be listed. I'll follow DSM-5-TR hierarchy where substance use disorders take precedence over substance-induced disorders when the criteria are met.\n\nThe formatting requires exactly five diagnoses with F-codes. Primary should be the most severe and active issue - opioid use disorder. Then alcohol, sedative, and stimulant use disorders based on the history. The fifth could be unspecified substance-related disorder for the polysubstance pattern, or maybe opioid withdrawal as a separate condition though it's typically coded under the use disorder. Let me check DSM-5-TR coding conventions... Actually, withdrawal can be listed separately if it's a focus of treatment. Given the acute presentation, that makes sense.",

This was his first psychiatric evaluation. He reported no past psychiatric history.\n\nMr. Yates traced his increased stress to a death in his city 4 months earlier. The death was recorded on video and featured an unarmed Black man being murdered by two white off-duty policemen who had accused him of theft. Like many people, Mr. Yates first saw the video via his social media \u201ctimeline,\u201d where it was routinely reposted by his friends. Because the murder had occurred in his hometown, it received much local attention.\n\nMr. Yates\u2019s social media timeline began to fill up with other examples of police brutality toward Black men. He said he watched the videos because they were \u201ctrending\u201d and appeared on his social media timeline abruptly, unfiltered, and without warning. In addition, he became increasingly aware of news programming, social media posts, and community memorials relating to the deaths and abuse of other Black men. Although he described trying to avoid details about these tragedies, he said that news, images, and videos were unavoidable, and he had become increasingly preoccupied with fears for the safety of his wife, his young sons, his extended family, and himself.\n\nMr. Yates reported that under normal circumstances, he \u201cdidn\u2019t like to talk about this stuff,\u201d but his wife had insisted that he get treatment because she was concerned that he \u201cdidn\u2019t seem himself.\u201d Mr. Yates wanted the evaluating psychiatrist to understand that he was not paranoid or overly sensitive about racism, and that up until recently, he\u2019d been good about \u201ccompartmentalizing.\u201d Nevertheless, he admitted that it had become difficult to stop thinking about violence against unarmed Black men. He had recently disabled his social media accounts in a proactive effort to minimize his exposure to images and commentary regarding the incidents. In addition to stopping use of social media, he reported avoidance of newspapers, the internet, and television.\n\nMr. Yates noted that he had also become edgy, nervous, and always on guard against attack. He had gradually reduced his explorations around the city, preferring to stay close to home. Although he had previously jogged every morning before work, he quit jogging in the local community park because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want any trouble.\u201d Mr. Yates reported his sleep over the past 3 months as being interrupted by vivid, disturbing dreams of being chased by police officers.\n\nFor Mr. Yates, evenings were particularly stressful, and he had recently increased his use of alcohol and cannabis to \u201cunwind\u201d at the end of the day. He also had begun to drink a six-pack, or more, of beer after dinner, often \u201cpassing out\u201d in the family den. The alcohol helped him to relax, and smoking \u201ca blunt\u201d of marijuana before bedtime improved his sleep and reduced nightmares. He stated that the biggest problem with the cannabis was his wife\u2019s complaining that their young children might see him using it or that his use might be detected in a random urine toxicology screen at work. Mr. Yates had been increasingly late to work but had not mentioned to his wife that he had twice been reprimanded by his supervisor for the lateness.\n\nMr. Yates reported first using both cannabis and alcohol at fraternity parties when he was about 19 years old. Throughout college, he smoked small amounts of marijuana once or twice weekly and rarely drank more than two beers at a time. In the decade since his college graduation, he had smoked marijuana only occasionally and tended to have no more than 1 or 2 beers on the weekend. He had never smoked tobacco or used other substances. His use of alcohol and cannabis had not increased until 3 months prior to the evaluation, after he started seeing the videos.\n\nMr. Yates denied experiencing feelings of worthlessness, guilt, or hopelessness. He reported no prior history of panic attacks, mania, psychosis, or obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and he had never received psychiatric hospitalization or outpatient treatment. He denied suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, or previous history of suicidality. There was no family psychiatric history aside from his father, who developed posttraumatic stress disorder following military service in Vietnam.",

Let me start by carefully reading the vignette again to understand the key details.\n\nShaun Yates is a 32-year-old IT security analyst presenting with stress linked to a traumatic event: witnessing police brutality videos. He's experiencing avoidance behaviors, hypervigilance, nightmares, and increased substance use. The assistant's response lists PTSD as the primary diagnosis, which makes sense given the exposure to traumatic events through repeated viewing of violent videos, leading to intrusive thoughts, nightmares, and avoidance. The other diagnoses include alcohol and cannabis use disorders, which align with his increased consumption to cope with stress. Adjustment disorder and other trauma-related disorders are considered as alternatives, while generalized anxiety disorder is noted due to his persistent worry and hypervigilance.\n\nThe assistant likely prioritized PTSD because the symptoms meet DSM-5 criteria: exposure to traumatic events (indirectly through videos), intrusive symptoms (nightmares, preoccupation), avoidance (of media, jogging), negative alterations in cognition\/mood, and arousal (hypervigilance, sleep disturbance). The timeline fits, starting after the videos. Substance use disorders are secondary but significant as they developed post-trauma and are used to self-medicate. Adjusting disorder is considered if PTSD criteria aren't fully met, but the presence of nightmares and avoidance leans more towards PTSD. Other trauma-related disorders might be ruled out since there's no direct personal trauma, but the repeated indirect exposure through social media could qualify as criterion A for PTSD. Generalized anxiety is included due to the persistent anxiety and hypervigilance, though it's secondary to the trauma response.\n\nThe assistant avoided non-psychiatric diagnoses and stuck to the requested format, listing F-codes appropriately. The reasoning demonstrates data extraction by noting key symptoms, timeline, and substance use patterns, and diagnostic reasoning by linking symptoms to DSM-5 criteria and considering differentials.",

She said she had found only an unopened bottle of acetaminophen and a dusty bottle of a medication used for hypertension.\n\nRoutine admission laboratory results indicated that Mr. Alvarez had an elevated blood urea nitrogen level, a low albumin level, and a high normal mean corpuscular volume. His blood pressure was 160\/110. In addition to medications related to the surgery, the chart indicated that he had received haloperidol 2 mg after a bout of agitation. A nursing note 1 hour after the haloperidol administration indicated that the patient was \u201cworried and stiff.\u201d\n\nOn mental status examination, Mr. Alvarez was lying at a 45-degree angle in his unkempt bed. He appeared thin and had moderate temporal wasting. His affect was sad, worried, and constricted. He appeared stiff and uncomfortable. He did not immediately respond to the interviewer\u2019s questions and comments. His eyes remained generally shut, but they did flicker open a few times, and his body habitus implied that he was awake. After multiple efforts, the psychiatrist was able to get the patient to say \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d and \u201cGet out.\u201d When asked where he was, Mr. Alvarez said, \u201cMy apartment.\u201d When he did open his eyes, the patient appeared confused. He did not respond to other questions and declined to do a clock drawing test. The surgery team had called in a one-to-one companion earlier in the day, and she said that the patient was generally either asleep or trying to get out of bed and that he had not been making any sense all day.",

    "model_thoughts":"Hmm, this is a complex clinical vignette requiring careful analysis. The patient is a 76-year-old widower with recent hip surgery, showing signs of acute mental status changes. Let me extract key clinical details systematically.\n\nFirst, the timeline is crucial: symptoms appeared post-surgery, with noted decline after wife's death 6 months ago. The mental status exam reveals confusion, disorientation, affective constriction, and catatonic features like mutism and stiffness. The haloperidol administration followed by worsening rigidity is particularly telling.\n\nLaboratory findings suggest possible malnutrition and dehydration. The social context indicates isolation and poor self-care. The acute onset post-surgery, coupled with metabolic abnormalities and neuroleptic exposure, points strongly toward delirium. The catatonic features need special consideration within this framework.\n\nFor differential diagnosis, major neurocognitive disorder seems less likely given the acute onset, though baseline decline may exist. Depressive disorders are complicated by the medical context. The haloperidol reaction suggests possible neuroleptic-induced catatonia or parkinsonism. Substance\/medication-induced disorders must be considered given the postoperative setting.\n\nThe primary diagnosis clearly emerges as delirium due to multiple medical etiologies. Secondary considerations should cover related psychiatric manifestations while respecting the acute medical context. I'll structure the list by diagnostic priority based on presentation acuity and clinical impact.",

    "vignette":"Arthur Cullman, a 71-year-old married man, was referred to a psychiatrist by his primary care physician for evaluation of depressive symptoms that had not responded to medication trials. His wife reported that Mr. Cullman had begun to change at age 68, about a year after his retirement. He had gradually stopped playing golf and cards, activities he had enjoyed \u201cfor decades.\u201d He had explained that seeing his friends was no longer \u201cfun,\u201d and he generally refused to socialize. Instead, he sat on the couch all day, worrying about finances and the future. He denied sadness, however, and any suicidal or homicidal ideation. His wife said he was sleeping 10\u201312 hours a day instead of his customary 7 hours and that he had, uncharacteristically, gained 8 pounds in less than 1 year.\n\nHis wife had become worried that retirement had left Mr. Cullman depressed, and she had mentioned her concerns to their primary care physician. Their physician agreed and prescribed sertraline (titrated to 100 mg\/day for 8 months) and then sustained-release venlafaxine (titrated to 150 mg twice daily and maintained at that level for over 1 year). Mr. Cullman\u2019s symptoms gradually worsened during these medication trials, and the internist ultimately referred him for a psychiatric evaluation.\n\nMr. Cullman\u2019s past psychiatric history was notable for an episode in his 20s when he had difficulty at work, felt apathetic and unconnected, and had difficulty concentrating. These symptoms persisted for several months and resolved without treatment as his work situation improved.\n\nMr. Cullman\u2019s family history was positive for a single major depressive episode in one of his two younger brothers; the depression responded well to psychotherapy and an antidepressant medication. His mother had developed dementia in her 70s.\n\nMr. Cullman\u2019s personal history revealed unremarkable development and childhood, graduation from college with a degree in business, a successful career as a corporate manager, and retirement at age 67. He and his wife had been married for 45 years, denied significant discord, and had three children and four grandchildren who were in good health. Premorbidly, he had been outgoing, energetic, and well organized.\n\nMr. Cullman\u2019s medical history was notable for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He was taking lisinopril, metformin, simvastatin, and venlafaxine.\n\nMental status examination revealed an alert, cooperative man who was neatly dressed and who had a steady but slow gait and no abnormal movements other than psychomotor slowing. Mr. Cullman\u2019s speech was soft in volume but normal in rate and rhythm, without paraphasic errors. He had a limited range of emotional expression, denied feeling sad or guilty, but felt he had retired too early. He denied self-blame, hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts or plans. He was aware that his wife was concerned and acknowledged that he was less energetic and active than in the past. He ascribed these changes to his retirement. He said he was generally satisfied with his life.\n\nOn cognitive examination, Mr. Cullman was oriented except for the date. He remembered one of three objects in 2 minutes, performed three of five serial 7 subtractions correctly, named four common objects correctly, and repeated a complex sentence accurately. He was able to draw the face of a clock and place the numbers correctly but was not able to correctly place the hands at 10 minutes after 2. His blood pressure was 142\/82, and his pulse was 84 and regular. His physical examination was noncontributory. His neurological examination revealed intact cranial nerves and 1+ symmetric deep tendon reflexes.",

    "model_thoughts":"First, I am considering the clinical case vignette about Arthur Cullman, a 71-year-old man with depressive symptoms. I need to base my diagnoses only on the provided information and my clinical expertise, without fabricating details. My response should be a structured list of the top 5 most likely DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes, starting with the primary diagnosis and then four secondary diagnoses.\n\nFrom the rubric, I should perform at Level 5 for both data extraction and diagnostic reasoning, but since the instruction says not to output clinical reasoning, I'll focus on extracting key information and forming diagnoses silently.\n\nKey information from the vignette:\n\n- Age: 71, married.\n\n- Symptoms started at age 68, after retirement.\n\n- Changes: stopped enjoying activities (golf, cards), social withdrawal, no sadness denied, but worrying about finances and future.\n\n- Sleep increased to 10-12 hours from 7 hours, weight gain of 8 pounds in less than a year.\n\n- Denied suicidal or homicidal ideation.\n\n- Treatment: sertraline and venlafaxine trials, but symptoms worsened.\n\n- Past psychiatric history: episode in 20s with apathy, difficulty concentrating, resolved without treatment.\n\n- Family history: brother with major depressive episode, mother with dementia in her 70s.\n\n- Personal history: successful career, retirement at 67, premorbidly outgoing and energetic.\n\n- Medical history: hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes.\n\n- Mental status exam: alert, cooperative, psychomotor slowing, soft speech, limited emotional expression, denies sadness or guilt, aware of concerns, ascribes changes to retirement.\n\n- Cognitive exam: oriented except for date, memory impairment (1 of 3 objects), difficulty with serial 7s (3 of 5 correct), naming intact, sentence repetition intact, clock drawing issue (can't place hands correctly at 10 after 2).\n\n- Neurological exam: intact cranial nerves, symmetric reflexes.\n\nI need to generate a differential diagnosis. The primary issue seems to be depressive symptoms, but with atypical features and cognitive impairments. Considering his age and family history of dementia, cognitive decline might be a factor.\n\nPossible diagnoses:\n\n1. **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)**: He has symptoms like anhedonia (stopped enjoyable activities), social withdrawal, sleep changes (hypersomnia), weight gain, and psychomotor slowing. However, he denies sadness or guilt, which might not be necessary for MDD if other symptoms are present. But the lack of response to antidepressants and worsening on them could indicate something else.\n\n2. **Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)**: But the onset is later in life, and symptoms have been present for about 3 years, which could fit. However, MDD might be more acute.\n\n3. **Adjustment Disorder**: Related to retirement, but symptoms are more severe and persistent.\n\n4. **Neurocognitive Disorder**: Given the cognitive impairments on exam, family history of dementia, and age, a neurocognitive disorder like Alzheimer's disease or another dementia might be present. The clock drawing test is often used to assess visuospatial skills in dementia.\n\n5. **Bipolar Disorder**: Past episode in 20s with apathy, and current symptoms with increased sleep and weight gain could suggest depressive phase, but no clear manic or hypomanic episodes mentioned.\n\n6. **Mood Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition**: He has medical conditions like hypertension, diabetes, which could contribute to depression or cognitive issues.\n\n7. **Substance\/Medication-Induced Mood Disorder**: On venlafaxine, but symptoms worsened on it, so unlikely.\n\n8. **Anxiety Disorder**: He worries about finances, but not the primary focus.\n\n9. **Late-Onset Schizophrenia or Other Psychotic Disorders**: No psychotic symptoms mentioned.\n\n10. **Personality Change Due to Another Medical Condition**: But this might overlap with neurocognitive disorders.\n\nBased on the cognitive deficits, especially memory impairment and executive dysfunction (clock drawing error), a neurocognitive disorder is likely. The depressive symptoms might be part of the prodrome or coexisting.\n\nIn DSM-5-TR, neurocognitive disorders include Major Neurocognitive Disorder and Mild Neurocognitive Disorder. Given the impairments, it could be Major Neurocognitive Disorder.\n\nPrimary diagnosis: Considering the cognitive decline and depressive features, and the lack of response to antidepressants, a neurocognitive disorder like Alzheimer's disease might be primary. But depressive symptoms are prominent.\n\nThe vignette says \"depressive symptoms that had not responded to medication trials,\" so depression is the presenting issue, but cognitive deficits are evident.\n\nI should list the most likely diagnoses in order.\n\nLet me think about the timeline and features:\n\n- Onset after retirement, gradual.\n\n- Anhedonia, social withdrawal, but no sadness.\n\n- Hypersomnia, weight gain.\n\n- Cognitive impairments: orientation to date off, memory issues, executive function issues.\n\n- Past history of similar episode in 20s that resolved.\n\n- Family history of depression and dementia.\n\nMedical conditions could be contributing.\n\nPossible primary diagnosis: **Major Depressive Disorder, With Atypical Features**? Atypical features include mood reactivity, weight gain, hypersomnia, leaden paralysis, interpersonal rejection sensitivity. He has weight gain and hypersomnia, but no mood reactivity mentioned; he denies sadness. Also, psychomotor slowing is present.\n\nAlternatively, **Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition**? Given his age and medical issues.\n\nBut the cognitive impairments point towards a neurocognitive disorder.\n\nIn older adults, depression can present with cognitive symptoms that mimic dementia, so it could be **Pseudodementia** (which isn't a DSM term; it's often Major Depressive Disorder with cognitive impairment).\n\nDSM-5-TR has **Major Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer's Disease** or **Major Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Multiple Etiologies**.\n\nGiven the clock drawing test and memory issues, Alzheimer's is a possibility.\n\nAlso, his mother had dementia in her 70s, so genetic risk.\n\nPast episode in 20s: could be a previous depressive episode, making recurrent MDD likely.\n\nBut the current episode is not responding to treatment, which might indicate an underlying neurocognitive disorder.\n\nI need to prioritize. The referral is for depressive symptoms, but cognitive exam shows deficits.\n\nTop 5 diagnoses:\n\n1. **Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate** \u2013 but he denies sadness, so perhaps with atypical features or unspecified.\n\n2. **Major Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer's Disease** \u2013 based on cognitive deficits and family history.\n\n3. **Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)** \u2013 but onset is late, so less likely.\n\n4. **Adjustment Disorder With Depressed Mood** \u2013 but symptoms are more severe and persistent.\n\n5. **Mood Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition** \u2013 given hypertension, diabetes, etc.\n\nAnother thought: the past episode in 20s might suggest a bipolar spectrum, but no mania mentioned.\n\nDSM-5-TR codes:\n\n- For Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent Episode: F33.1 (moderate) or F33.2 (severe without psychotic features), but based on symptoms, moderate might fit.\n\n- For Major Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer's Disease: F02.80 (without behavioral disturbance) or F02.81 (with behavioral disturbance). Here, depressive symptoms are present, so perhaps with behavioral disturbance.\n\n- For Persistent Depressive Disorder: F34.1\n\n- For Adjustment Disorder With Depressed Mood: F43.21\n\n- For Mood Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition: F06.31 (depressive type) or F06.34 (with depressive features).\n\nAlso, consider **Unspecified Depressive Disorder** if criteria not fully met.\n\nHe has significant anhedonia and other symptoms, so MDD criteria might be met despite denying sadness. DSM-5 criteria for MDD require five or more symptoms during the same 2-week period, one of which must be either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure. He has loss of interest (anhedonia), so that qualifies. Other symptoms: weight gain (increased appetite), hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation (psychomotor slowing), fatigue or loss of energy (less energetic), feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (denied), diminished ability to think or concentrate (cognitive issues), recurrent thoughts of death (denied). He has at least: anhedonia, weight gain, hypersomnia, psychomotor retardation, fatigue, and concentration issues. That's six symptoms, so MDD is likely.\n\nBut the cognitive deficits might be part of the depression or separate.\n\nIn the context of no response to antidepressants and progressive worsening, a neurocognitive disorder might be primary.\n\nI think the primary diagnosis should be Major Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer's Disease, with depressive symptoms as a feature or comorbid.\n\nBut the vignette is presented as depressive symptoms, so perhaps MDD is primary.\n\nLet's see the instruction: \"Give the top 5 most likely diagnoses with corresponding ICD-10 F-codes, consisting of the primary diagnosis and 4 secondary diagnoses.\"\n\nPrimary diagnosis is the most likely one based on the case.\n\nFrom a clinical perspective, in a 71-year-old with cognitive impairments and depression not responding to treatment, Alzheimer's disease is a strong consideration.\n\nMoreover, the clock drawing test is often impaired in Alzheimer's.\n\nSo, I'll go with:\n\n1. Major Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer's Disease - F02.80 (assuming without behavioral disturbance, but depressive symptoms are present, so maybe F02.81, but depressive disorder might be coded separately).\n\nIn DSM-5-TR, if depressive symptoms are part of the neurocognitive disorder, it can be specified with behavioral disturbance.\n\nBut for coding, F02.81 is for with behavioral disturbance, which includes mood symptoms.\n\nAlternatively, if depression is comorbid, it should be listed separately.\n\nFor the list, I need to provide five diagnoses, so I can list both.\n\nBut primary should be the main condition.\n\nI think the cognitive decline is significant, so neurocognitive disorder is primary.\n\nSecondary diagnoses could include depressive disorders.\n\nLet me list:\n\nPrimary: Major Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer's Disease - F02.81 (with behavioral disturbance, since depressive symptoms are present)\n\nSecondary:\n\n2. Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent Episode, Moderate - F33.1\n\nBut if neurocognitive disorder is primary, depression might be secondary or part of it.\n\nIn DSM, if depressive symptoms are due to another medical condition (like Alzheimer's), it might be Mood Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition.\n\nBut Alzheimer's is a neurocognitive disorder, so depressive features can be part of it.\n\nFor clarity, I'll list separate diagnoses.\n\nBased on the case, he might have both.\n\nTop 5:\n\n1. Major Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer's Disease - F02.81\n\n2. Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate - F33.1\n\n3. Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) - F34.1 (less likely, but possible given chronicity)\n\n4. Adjustment Disorder With Depressed Mood - F43.21\n\n5. Mood Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (e.g., due to diabetes or hypertension) - F06.31\n\nBut that might not be the best ordering.\n\nAnother possibility: **Unspecified Neurocognitive Disorder** if not sure about etiology, but with family history and presentation, Alzheimer's is likely.\n\nPast episode in 20s: could be a previous MDD episode, supporting recurrent MDD.\n\nSo, for primary, I think Major Depressive Disorder is a strong contender because that's what he was referred for, and cognitive symptoms could be part of depression.\n\nBut the cognitive exam shows objective deficits beyond what is typical for depression alone.\n\nIn depression, cognitive deficits are common, but the clock drawing error might indicate more specific brain dysfunction.\n\nI recall that in depression, cognitive impairments are often in attention and memory, but visuospatial tasks like clock drawing might be less affected unless there is underlying dementia.\n\nGiven his age and risk factors, dementia is probable.\n\nLet's look at ICD-10 F-codes:\n\n- F32.x for depressive episode, F33.x for recurrent depressive disorder.\n\n- F02.8 for dementia in Alzheimer's disease.\n\n- F03 for unspecified dementia.\n\n- F06.3 for mood disorder due to brain disease or medical condition.\n\n- F43.2 for adjustment disorders.\n\nFor Major Neurocognitive Disorder in DSM-5-TR, ICD-10 code depends on the etiology.\n\nIn this case, likely Alzheimer's.\n\nSo, for the list:\n\n1. Primary: Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent Episode, Moderate - F33.1\n\nOr should it be Major Neurocognitive Disorder?\n\nI think I need to decide based on clinical judgment.\n\nThe case vignette: he was referred for depressive symptoms, but evaluation reveals cognitive impairments. In clinical practice, both might be diagnosed, but the primary issue might be the neurocognitive disorder causing depressive symptoms.\n\nHowever, the past episode in 20s suggests a history of mood disorder.\n\nPerhaps the primary diagnosis is Major Depressive Disorder, and the secondary is Neurocognitive Disorder.\n\nBut the instruction says \"top 5 most likely diagnoses,\" so I can list both.\n\nLet's order by likelihood.\n\nMost likely: Major Depressive Disorder, given the presentation and history.\n\nSecond: Major Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer's Disease.\n\nThird: Persistent Depressive Disorder.\n\nFourth: Adjustment Disorder.\n\nFifth: Mood Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition.\n\nBut that seems redundant.\n\nAnother idea: **Bipolar II Disorder**? Past episode in 20s with apathy could be depressive, and current is depressive, but no hypomania mentioned, so unlikely.\n\n**Cyclothymic Disorder**? No.\n\n**Anxiety Disorder**? He worries, but not primary.\n\n**Somatic Symptom Disorder**? No.\n\n**Substance-Induced**? No.\n\n**Psychotic Disorders**? No.\n\nSo, focusing on mood and cognitive disorders.\n\nI think the cognitive deficits are significant, so neurocognitive disorder should be high on the list.\n\nPerhaps:\n\n1. Major Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer's Disease - F02.81\n\n2. Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate - F33.1\n\n3. Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) - F34.1\n\n4. Adjustment Disorder With Depressed Mood - F43.21\n\n5. Unspecified Depressive Disorder - F32.9\n\nBut that's not varied.\n\nAnother secondary diagnosis could be **Mild Neurocognitive Disorder** if not major, but based on cognitive exam, it might be major.\n\nFrom the exam: orientation off, memory impairment, executive function issue. This could meet criteria for Major Neurocognitive Disorder.\n\nDSM-5 criteria for Major NCD: significant cognitive decline from previous level in one or more cognitive domains, interferes with independence in everyday activities.\n\nHe has decline in memory and executive function, and it interferes with activities as he stopped socializing and sits on couch all day, so yes.\n\nSo, Major NCD is likely.\n\nFor depressive disorder, he has symptoms, so both can be comorbid.\n\nIn older adults, depression and dementia often co-occur.\n\nSo, for the list, I'll put:\n\n1. Major Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer's Disease - F02.81\n\n2. Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent Episode, Moderate - F33.1\n\n3. Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) - F34.1\n\n4. Adjustment Disorder With Depressed Mood - F43.21\n\n5. Mood Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition, Depressive Type - F06.31\n\nBut I need to ensure that diagnoses are distinct and based on the case.\n\nPerhaps instead of Adjustment Disorder, which is less likely given severity, include **Unspecified Neurocognitive Disorder** if Alzheimer's is not confirmed, but the case suggests it.\n\nThe case doesn't confirm Alzheimer's, but based on history and exam, it's a strong possibility.\n\nIn differential, other neurocognitive disorders like vascular dementia, but no clear evidence.\n\nHe has hypertension and diabetes, so vascular risk factors, but no focal neurological signs mentioned.\n\nNeurological exam was noncontributory except symmetric reflexes, so Alzheimer's is plausible.\n\nSo, I'll stick with that.\n\nFor formatting:\n\n1. <Primary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n\n2. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n\n3. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n\n4. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n\n5. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n\nPrimary diagnosis should be the most likely one. I think Major Depressive Disorder is the presenting problem, but Major Neurocognitive Disorder might be the underlying cause.\n\nLet's see the vignette title: it's about depressive symptoms not responding to medication.\n\nIn psychiatry, when depression is treatment-resistant in the elderly, underlying dementia is often considered.\n\nSo, I'll make Major Neurocognitive Disorder primary.\n\nFinal list:\n\n1. Major Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer's Disease - F02.81\n\n2. Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent Episode, Moderate - F33.1\n\n3. Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) - F34.1\n\n4. Adjustment Disorder With Depressed Mood - F43.21\n\n5. Mood Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition, Depressive Type - F06.31\n\nBut Persistent Depressive Disorder and Adjustment Disorder might not be as likely given the recurrence and severity.\n\nAnother secondary diagnosis could be **Unspecified Depressive Disorder** if criteria not fully met, but I think MDD criteria are met.\n\nPerhaps include **Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition** like vascular disease, but no evidence.\n\nI think for secondary, I should list other possibilities in the differential.\n\nSo, for secondary diagnoses, list other conditions that could explain symptoms.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Major Depressive Disorder is a key one.\n\n- Then, perhaps **Mild Neurocognitive Disorder** if the decline is not major, but it seems significant.\n\n- **Bipolar Disorder**? Unlikely.\n\n- **Anxiety Disorder**? He has worry, so **Generalized Anxiety Disorder** could be considered, but not primary.\n\nHe worries about finances and future, which could be part of depression or GAD.\n\nBut in the context, it might be subsumed under depression.\n\nTo have a varied list, I can include GAD.\n\nDSM-5-TR code for GAD: F41.1\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\n1. Major Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer's Disease - F02.81\n\n2. Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate - F33.1\n\n3. Generalized Anxiety Disorder - F41.1\n\n4. Persistent Depressive Disorder - F34.1\n\n5. Adjustment Disorder - F43.21\n\nBut GAD might not be prominent enough.\n\nHe denies sadness, so anxiety could be a feature.\n\nIn the mental status, he worries, but it's not elaborated.\n\nI think I'll go with the first list.\n\nTo refine, based on clinical expertise, in this case, the most likely primary diagnosis is Major Depressive Disorder, with Major Neurocognitive Disorder as a close second or comorbid.\n\nBut for the list, I need to choose one primary.\n\nLet's read the vignette again: \"referred to a psychiatrist for evaluation of depressive symptoms\" and \"symptoms gradually worsened during these medication trials.\"\n\nSo, depression is the focus, but cognitive impairments are found.\n\nIn the differential, both are important.\n\nI think for primary, I'll choose Major Depressive Disorder because it's the reason for referral and has historical precedent.\n\nBut the cognitive deficits might indicate that depression is secondary to dementia.\n\nIn DSM, if depressive symptoms are due to dementia, it should be coded as part of the dementia or as a separate mood disorder due to another medical condition.\n\nTo simplify, I'll list Major Depressive Disorder as primary and Major Neurocognitive Disorder as secondary.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent Episode, Moderate - F33.1\n\n2. Major Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer's Disease - F02.81\n\n3. Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) - F34.1\n\n4. Adjustment Disorder With Depressed Mood - F43.21\n\n5. Mood Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition, Depressive Type - F06.31\n\nThat seems reasonable.\n\nI'll proceed with that.",

    "vignette":"Betty Drucker, a 76-year-old white woman, was experiencing sad mood, diminished interest in activities that had given her pleasure in the past, neglect of her personal appearance and household responsibilities, feelings of insecurity when interacting with others, and difficulties in concentration and word finding. She had reduced her social interactions, stopped going to her senior citizens center, and dropped out of her weekly card game because she experienced no pleasure and could not adequately concentrate. She had lost 7 pounds in the prior 2 months, and her sleep was interrupted by periods of insomnia with agonizing ruminations. This was the first time she had experienced any psychiatric symptoms.\n\nMs. Druker had retired 10 years earlier after a successful career as an attorney. She had been divorced for 30 years.

Neurologically, there's a mild left-sided facial drop, and CT scan shows white matter hyperintensities.\n\nNow, organizing this data. The core symptoms point towards a depressive episode, but given her age and cognitive deficits, I need to consider neurocognitive disorders. The white matter hyperintensities and mild facial drop suggest vascular issues. Her MMSE is 24, which is borderline, and cognitive tests show executive function problems.\n\nFor differential diagnosis, the primary issue seems to be a major depressive episode, possibly with comorbid anxiety. However, the cognitive impairments and neurological findings indicate a possible neurocognitive disorder. Vascular dementia comes to mind due to the white matter changes and history of cardiovascular disease. But the depressive symptoms are prominent, so maybe depressive disorder due to another medical condition, like vascular disease. Alternatively, it could be a major neurocognitive disorder due to vascular disease with behavioral disturbance (depression). \n\nI should also consider persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) but this is her first episode, so that's less likely. Adjustment disorder is possible but the symptoms are severe and include cognitive deficits, so probably not. Anxiety disorders are present but secondary to depression. Substance-induced mood disorder isn't indicated as she's not on relevant medications or substances that cause depression. \n\nThe key is the interaction between vascular disease and depression. Vascular depression is a concept where cerebrovascular disease contributes to depressive symptoms, often with cognitive impairment. Given the CT findings and her history, this fits. So the primary diagnosis might be major depressive disorder, but due to the medical condition, it could be classified as depressive disorder due to another medical condition (vascular disease). \n\nHowever, DSM-5-TR requires specifying if it's a major neurocognitive disorder due to vascular disease with depressive features. Her cognitive deficits are notable but not severe enough for dementia yet, but the white matter changes and cognitive test results suggest vascular mild neurocognitive disorder. \n\nLet me list the top five diagnoses. Primary: Depressive disorder due to another medical condition (vascular disease) with major depressive-like episode. Secondary: Major neurocognitive disorder due to vascular disease, mild. Then other differentials like major depressive disorder, single episode, severe; persistent depressive disorder (though less likely); and anxiety disorder due to another medical condition. But I need to ensure they fit the DSM-5-TR criteria and ICD-10 codes. \n\nWait, the cognitive issues are prominent, so vascular mild neurocognitive disorder might be primary, but the depressive symptoms are the main presenting issue. According to DSM-5, if the cognitive deficits are present but not the sole focus, and depressive symptoms are prominent, it could be both. However, the vignette emphasizes depressive symptoms first. \n\nGiven the white matter hyperintensities and history, vascular disease is contributing to both cognitive and mood symptoms. So depressive disorder due to cerebrovascular disease is appropriate. Then, since there are cognitive impairments, vascular mild neurocognitive disorder is secondary. \n\nOther possibilities: adjustment disorder with depressed mood, but the symptoms are too severe and include cognitive issues. Anxiety is present but not primary. Substance\/medication-induced depressive disorder isn't supported as her medications aren't typically depressogenic. \n\nSo, final list: \n1. Depressive disorder due to cerebrovascular disease, with major depressive-like episode - F06.31\n2. Major neurocognitive disorder due to vascular disease, mild, without behavioral disturbance - F01.51 (but since depression is present, maybe with behavioral disturbance? However, the depressive disorder is coded separately, so mild NCD without behavioral disturbance might be correct, as the depression is already captured in the first diagnosis.)\n3. Major depressive disorder, single episode, severe - F32.2 (as a differential if the medical condition isn't the primary cause, but given the vascular findings, it's likely due to that)\n4. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood - F43.21 (less likely given severity and cognitive symptoms)\n5. Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition (cerebrovascular disease) - F06.4 (since she has anxious mood)\n\nBut I need to base it strictly on the vignette. The white matter changes are significant, so vascular etiology is key. Therefore, depressive disorder due to another medical condition is primary. Then vascular mild NCD. Major depressive disorder as a rule-out if the medical link isn't established. Adjustment and anxiety as other possibilities. \n\nLet me check ICD-10 codes: F06.31 for depressive disorder due to known physiological condition, F01.51 for vascular mild neurocognitive disorder, F32.2 for major depressive disorder, single episode severe, F43.21 for adjustment disorder with depressed mood, and F06.4 for anxiety due to medical condition. \n\nYes, that seems appropriate. I'll structure the output as requested.",

    "vignette":"Carl Estel, a 74-year-old right-handed married man, was brought for a neuropsychiatric evaluation after a multi-year decline marked by stiffness, forgetfulness, and apathy. His wife had been trying to get him in for an evaluation for years and had finally become desperate enough to enlist his brothers to bring him for the evaluation.\n\nMrs. Estel described her husband\u2019s problems as starting when he retired from his job as a plumbing contractor at age 65. He had seemed \u201cout of sorts\u201d almost immediately, and she had wondered at the time whether he was getting depressed. He became uncharacteristically forgetful, misplacing items and neglecting to pay bills. He had trouble with appointments, medications, and calculations. He had refused to see a physician until he was involved in a traffic accident a few years prior to this evaluation. At that time, a physician had found no significant physical injuries but had said that the accident was caused by inattention and diminished depth perception; she had recommended that Mr. Estel stop driving, and suggested that he get a more thorough evaluation for early dementia.\n\nOver the past year, things had gotten worse. Mr. Estel often could not recall the outcome of sporting events that he had just watched on television, although his memory improved with cues. He resisted activities such as travel and socializing that he had previously enjoyed. A former athlete, he stopped taking walks around the neighborhood after several falls. He quit playing cards with neighbors because the rules had become confusing. He looked depressed and acted apathetic but generally said he was fine. His judgment and problem-solving skills appeared to have significantly declined. Despite having completed 4 years of college and worked for many years as a successful professional plumber, Mr. Estel was now periodically unable to operate household appliances.\n\nAll of these cognitive problems seemed to fluctuate, so that his wife reported that sometimes he was \u201calmost like his old self,\u201d whereas at other times it was \u201clike living with a zombie, a depressed zombie.\u201d She also described his frequent exhaustion, daytime drowsiness, and staring spells.\n\nWhen asked specifically about her husband\u2019s sleep, Mrs. Estel reported that in fact neither of them slept well. Mainly, she said, it was because of her husband \u201cacting out his dreams.\u201d During these episodes, which occurred several times a month, he would punch and scream, and would occasionally fall out of bed. After sustaining bruises as a result of several of the episodes, Mrs. Estel decided it would be safer to sleep on the couch. She recalled that these sleep episodes began just before her husband retired; she had wondered at the time whether he had posttraumatic stress disorder, but she did not think he had suffered any particular trauma. A few years earlier, a friend had offered her a \u201csleeping pill\u201d that had helped her own husband with dementia. Mr. Estel had responded to the unknown medication with extreme rigidity and confusion, and his wife had nearly taken him to the emergency room in the middle of the night.\n\nMrs. Estel denied that her husband had ever had any psychiatric illness. When asked about psychotic symptoms, she said that perhaps every week or so, he swatted at invisible things in the air. She did not think he heard voices or felt suspicious.\n\nMr. Estel\u2019s medical history was notable for hypercholesterolemia, cardiovascular disease with a history of stent placement, and possible transient ischemic attacks. His family history was positive for his mother having developed dementia in her mid-70s.\n\nOn examination, Mr. Estel was a stooped, stiff man who shuffled into the office. While listening to his wife present the history, he stared into space, seeming to pay no attention to the content of the conversation. His right hand was tremulous. He appeared depressed, but when asked, he said he felt fine. His voice was so quiet that words were often unintelligible even when the interviewer leaned close. He drooled at times and did not notice until his wife wiped his chin.\n\nWhen asked to participate in cognitive testing, he shrugged his shoulders and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d",

    "model_thoughts":"Hmm, this is a complex neuropsychiatric case requiring careful analysis of multiple overlapping symptoms. The patient presents with a multi-year decline involving cognitive fluctuations, motor symptoms, sleep disturbances, and neuropsychiatric features.\n\nThe key elements to consider are: progressive cognitive impairment with fluctuations, REM sleep behavior disorder evident from dream enactment, Parkinsonian features like stiffness and shuffling gait, visual hallucinations of swatting at invisible things, and apathy mistaken for depression. These core features strongly align with Lewy body disease spectrum.\n\nThe differential needs to account for the timeline and combination of symptoms. Alzheimer's should be considered due to memory complaints and family history, but the prominent motor and fluctuation features make it less likely as primary. Vascular neurocognitive disorder is relevant given cardiovascular history, but wouldn't explain the full symptom constellation. Major depressive disorder was initially suspected but doesn't capture the neurological findings. The medication reaction to an unknown sedative causing acute rigidity is particularly telling for neuroleptic sensitivity seen in Lewy body disorders.\n\nThe cognitive testing refusal and profound apathy suggest possible frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder, though the motor symptoms and sleep issues point more toward Lewy body pathology.

    "vignette":"Part 1:\n\nDorothy Franklin, a 54-year-old married former waitress, was brought into the psychiatric emergency room (ER) by her husband for escalating delusions and visual hallucinations. Her husband reported that she had been episodically agitated for about 10 years, uncharacteristically suspicious for about 6 months, and complaining of daily hallucinations for weeks to months. The patient referred to her experience as \u201cmy nightmare.\u201d In a terrified voice, she explained, \u201cI see a judge standing in front of me. Plain as day. He is a good judge, but he threatens to kill me, and I can\u2019t stop him. I can\u2019t believe no one else can see him. Can you help?\u201d\n\nMr. Franklin reports that his wife had been \u201ccompletely fine\u201d until about a decade earlier, when she was in her early 40s. At that point, he reports that she had become frequently agitated, paranoid, worried, and occasionally aggressive. He had brought her to psychiatrists and internists, and she had received several diagnoses, including late-onset schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, paranoid personality, and anxiety. She and her husband could not recall the names of all of the many psychiatric medications that she had been prescribed over the years, but they included antidepressant, antipsychotic, antianxiety, and mood-stabilizing medications.\n\nMs. Franklin had smoked half a pack of cigarettes a day for many years but only rarely drank alcohol and never used recreational drugs. She had worked as a waitress for 20 years but quit 10 years prior to the evaluation because of too many \u201cdropped trays,\u201d misremembered customer orders, and uncharacteristic irritability. Around that time, she was arrested for \u201chitting someone\u201d in a shopping mall, and she and her husband decided she needed to reduce her stress level.\n\nThe patient had two healthy adult children in their late 20s. She had one sister with \u201cdepression and irritability.\u201d The patient\u2019s mother had passed away 10 years earlier at age 70. She had been wheelchair bound for years because of severe dementia, postural instability, and involuntary movements. The patient\u2019s maternal grandfather \u201cgot sick\u201d in his late 50s and completed suicide with a firearm at age 62.\n\nOn mental status examination in the ER, Ms. Franklin was frightened but cooperative. She appeared her stated age, with thin body habitus and good grooming and hygiene. She sat next to her husband, holding his hand and often looking to him when asked questions. She had moderate psychomotor slowing, and noticeable involuntary \u201cdancelike\u201d movements of her trunk and upper extremities. Her eye contact was intermittent but intense. Ms. Franklin described her mood as \u201cnot well at all,\u201d and her affect was blunted and minimally reactive. Her speech was soft and slowed, with minimal spontaneity. Her thought process was linear but slowed. She was preoccupied by paranoid delusions and visual hallucinations. She reported actively hallucinating during the interview. She denied suicidal and homicidal thoughts or plans. On cognitive examination, she was alert and oriented to person, place, and time. She had good attention and concentration, although she had significant impairments in both short- and long-term memory. Her performance on the Mini-Mental State Examination and clock drawing test revealed moderate impairment in planning and visuospatial tasks.\n\nIn the ER, results from extensive laboratory testing were normal. The patient was admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit for safety and for further workup of her psychotic symptoms.\n\nPart 2:\n\nAfter Ms. Franklin was admitted to the psychiatric unit, she received brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to rule out mass lesions (e.g., tumor or stroke) and demyelinating processes (e.g., multiple sclerosis). MRI findings were normal, and the neurology department was consulted for diagnostic assistance and administration of EEG to evaluate for a possible seizure disorder. While she was actively hallucinating, Ms. Franklin\u2019s electroencephalogram was negative for seizure activity.\n\nGiven the nature and time course of Ms. Franklin\u2019s symptoms, coupled with her family history of dementia and delayed-onset psychiatric disturbances, the psychiatry and neurology teams became concerned about the possibility of Huntington\u2019s disease. After extensive discussion with the patient and her spouse, she agreed to undergo genetic testing for Huntington\u2019s disease, and the test result was positive for 44 trinucleotide (CAG) repeats. After further psychosocial and medication management, she and her husband were referred to a comprehensive outpatient Huntington\u2019s disease clinic.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the clinical case vignette. Dorothy is a 54-year-old woman with a 10-year history of escalating symptoms. Her husband reports episodic agitation for about 10 years, increasing suspicion over 6 months, and daily visual hallucinations for weeks to months. She describes seeing a judge who threatens her, which she calls \"my nightmare.\"\n\nWait, there's a family history that's crucial here. Her mother had severe dementia, postural instability, and involuntary movements, wheelchair-bound by age 70. Maternal grandfather had an illness in his late 50s and died by suicide at 62. That's a significant pattern of neurological and psychiatric issues across generations.\n\nOn mental status exam, she has psychomotor slowing, involuntary \"dancelike\" movements\u2014that sounds like chorea. Cognitive tests show moderate impairment in memory, planning, and visuospatial tasks. MRI and EEG were normal, but genetic testing confirmed Huntington's disease with 44 CAG repeats.\n\nHmm, Huntington's disease is a genetic disorder causing progressive motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms. The DSM-5-TR categorizes it under neurocognitive disorders due to Huntington's disease. But she also has psychotic features like delusions and hallucinations, which are common in Huntington's. So the primary diagnosis should be Major Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Huntington's Disease, with behavioral disturbance.\n\nNow, for secondary diagnoses. She has prominent psychotic symptoms\u2014visual hallucinations and paranoid delusions. These aren't better explained by another psychotic disorder like schizophrenia because they're part of the Huntington's progression. So Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (Huntington's) makes sense.\n\nShe also has depressive symptoms: blunted affect, psychomotor slowing, and her mood is \"not well at all.\" That could be Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition. \n\nAnxiety might be present given her agitation and fear, but the vignette doesn't specify anxiety symptoms beyond agitation, which could be part of the psychosis or depression. However, her husband mentioned past diagnoses including anxiety, so it's worth considering Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition.\n\nAnother thought: the involuntary movements and family history point to Huntington's, but since that's already the primary neurocognitive disorder, the psychotic and depressive features are separate manifestations. Also, she had a history of aggression leading to arrest, which might indicate intermittent explosive disorder, but that's less clear. Probably not top five.\n\nSo top five: Major Neurocognitive Disorder due to Huntington's, Psychotic Disorder due to Huntington's, Depressive Disorder due to Huntington's, maybe an Anxiety Disorder due to Huntington's, and perhaps a medication-induced movement disorder since she's on antipsychotics, but the chorea is from Huntington's. Alternatively, rule out other neurocognitive disorders, but Huntington's is confirmed.\n\nWait, the rubric says to base diagnoses only on provided info. She has Huntington's, so all psychiatric symptoms are likely due to that. Therefore, the primary is the neurocognitive disorder, and secondary are the psychiatric manifestations due to the medical condition.\n\nLet me list them: \n1. Major Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Huntington's Disease, With Behavioral Disturbance (psychotic and depressive features) - F02.81\n2. Psychotic Disorder Due to Huntington's Disease, With Hallucinations - F06.0\n3. Depressive Disorder Due to Huntington's Disease - F06.31\n4. Anxiety Disorder Due to Huntington's Disease - F06.4\n5. Maybe Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition, but not mentioned. Alternatively, Other Specified Neurocognitive Disorder, but Huntington's is specified. \n\nHold on, the vignette says she had past diagnoses including bipolar and paranoid personality, but those aren't current. Current symptoms are better explained by Huntington's. So secondary diagnoses should all be due to Huntington's.\n\nAlso, she has involuntary movements, which are part of Huntington's, so no separate movement disorder diagnosis needed. \n\nFinal list:\n1. Major Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Huntington's Disease, With Behavioral Disturbance - F02.81\n2. Psychotic Disorder Due to Huntington's Disease - F06.0\n3. Depressive Disorder Due to Huntington's Disease - F06.31\n4. Anxiety Disorder Due to Huntington's Disease - F06.4\n5. Maybe Other Specified Mental Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition for irritability\/aggression, but that might be covered under behavioral disturbance in the neurocognitive disorder. Alternatively, since she has a history of aggression and irritability, that could be part of the behavioral disturbance, so maybe no separate code. \n\nActually, the DSM-5-TR allows multiple diagnoses due to the same medical condition if different symptom clusters are present. So psychotic, depressive, and anxiety disorders due to Huntington's are appropriate.\n\nI should check ICD-10 codes. F02.81 is for dementia in other diseases classified elsewhere with behavioral disturbance. F06.0 is psychosis due to known physiological condition. F06.31 is depressive disorder due to known physiological condition. F06.4 is anxiety due to known physiological condition. \n\nWhat about the fifth? Perhaps Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Huntington's Disease Without Behavioral Disturbance, but she has behavioral disturbances, so that's not right. Maybe Mild Neurocognitive Disorder, but it's moderate per the vignette. Alternatively, since she has a family history and genetic confirmation, Huntington's disease itself is a medical condition, but the psychiatric manifestations are coded separately.\n\nMaybe Substance\/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder, but she doesn't use substances. Medication-induced movement disorder from antipsychotics, but the movements are likely from Huntington's. \n\nI think four diagnoses cover it. But the instruction says top five. Perhaps Unspecified Neurocognitive Disorder, but it's specified. Or Delirium, but she's alert and oriented. No, she's cognitively impaired but not delirious.\n\nWait, she has cognitive impairment, psychosis, depression, anxiety. That's four. Maybe a personality change due to Huntington's? The vignette mentions past diagnosis of paranoid personality, but that might be pre-existing or misdiagnosed. However, the current paranoid delusions are psychotic, not personality. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder, but it's better explained by Huntington's. So the fifth could be Other Specified Mental Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition for irritability or aggression, code F06.8.\n\nYeah, that might work. So:\n1. Major Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Huntington's Disease, With Behavioral Disturbance - F02.81\n2. Psychotic Disorder Due to Huntington's Disease - F06.0\n3. Depressive Disorder Due to Huntington's Disease - F06.31\n4. Anxiety Disorder Due to Huntington's Disease - F06.4\n5. Other Specified Mental Disorder Due to Huntington's Disease (for irritability\/aggression) - F06.8\n\nBut the vignette doesn't explicitly mention anxiety symptoms other than agitation, which could be part of psychosis. However, her husband mentioned anxiety as a past diagnosis, and she appears frightened, so anxiety is plausible. \n\nAlternatively, replace anxiety with medication-induced movement disorder, but the chorea is from Huntington's, so not medication-induced. \n\nI think anxiety is reasonable. So I'll go with that list.",

    "vignette":"Only upon the repeated and fervent insistence of her parents did 19-year-old Emily reluctantly agree to see a psychiatrist. \u201cIt\u2019s not me you want to see,\u201d Emily proclaimed emphatically. \u201cIt\u2019s my insane parents who need your help.\u201d Emily did not offer a chief complaint, aside from the concern that her parents were driving her \u201ccrazy.\u201d She added, \u201cEverything is going great in my life. I have plenty of friends, go out almost every night, and always have lots of fun.\u201d\n\nWhile Emily was taking some time away from \u201cthe so-called real world,\u201d her sister was attending Duke University, her younger brother was excelling at a competitive private high school, and both her parents seemed to enjoy their careers as radiologists. She asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s enough strivers for one family?\u201d\n\nEmily agreed to have her parents join the session, and they told a different story. They tearfully disclosed that their daughter had become irritable, unproductive, and oppositional. She drank to intoxication almost every night, often not returning home for an entire weekend. In searching her room, they had found small amounts of marijuana, alprazolam (Xanax), cocaine, and prescription stimulants. The parents described the changes in Emily\u2019s personality as \u201can adolescent nightmare\u201d and described her friends as \u201closers who do nothing but dye their hair, get tattoos, and hate everything.\u201d Emily\u2019s attitudes and behavior contrasted markedly with those of her parents and siblings. \u201cWe don\u2019t mind that she is doing her own thing and that she isn\u2019t conservative like the rest of us,\u201d her father said, \u201cbut it\u2019s like we don\u2019t even recognize who she\u2019s become.\u201d\n\nAccording to her parents, Emily\u2019s \u201cadolescent nightmare\u201d began 4 years earlier. She had apparently been a studious 15-year-old girl with a lively sense of humor and a wide circle of \u201cterrific friends.\u201d \u201cAlmost overnight,\u201d she began to shun her longtime friends in favor of \u201cdropouts and malcontents\u201d and began to accumulate traffic tickets and school detentions. Instead of her former bright-eyed curiosity, Emily manifested a lack of interest in all her academic subjects, and her grades dropped from As to Ds. The parents were at an absolute loss to explain the sudden and dramatic change.\n\nThe abrupt change in performance led the psychiatrist to ask Emily to take a battery of neuropsychological tests so the results could be compared with those of tests that she had taken when she had applied to a private high school several years earlier. In particular, Emily retook two high school admissions tests: the System for Assessment and Group Evaluation (SAGE), which measures a broad array of academic and perceptual aptitudes, and the Differential Aptitude Tests (DAT), which focus on reasoning, spelling, and perceptual skills.\n\nOn the SAGE, her average percentile scores dropped from the upper 10% for a 13-year-old to the bottom 10% for an adult (and the bottom 20% for a 13-year-old). When Emily took the DAT at age 13, she scored in the highest range for ninth graders across almost all measures. Her worst result had been in spelling, where she scored at the second-highest level. Upon repeating the test at age 19, she scored below the high school average in all measures.\n\nEEG, brain CT, and T2-weighted brain MRI scans showed no evidence of structural brain damage. However, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) T2-weighted MRI displayed a clear lesion in the left frontal cortex, highly suggestive of previous injury to that region.\n\nUpon further questioning about the crucial period in which she seemed to have changed, Emily admitted to being in a traffic accident with her now ex-boyfriend, Mark. Although Emily did not recall much from this episode, she remembered that she hit her head and that she had bad headaches for many weeks thereafter. Because Emily was not bleeding and there was no damage to the car, neither Mark nor Emily reported the incident to anyone. With Emily\u2019s permission, the psychiatrist contacted Mark, who was away at college but a willing and excellent historian. He remembered the incident well. \u201cEmily hit her head very, very hard on the dashboard of my car. She was not totally unconscious but very dazed. For about 3 hours, she spoke very slowly, complained that her head hurt badly, and was confused. For about 2 hours she didn\u2019t know where she was or what day it was. She also threw up twice. I was really scared, but Emily didn\u2019t want me to worry her parents since they\u2019re so overprotective. And then she broke up with me, and we\u2019ve hardly spoken since.\u201d",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the clinical case vignette. The patient is Emily, a 19-year-old brought in by her parents. She herself doesn't think there's anything wrong and claims her parents are the ones who need help. She mentions having plenty of friends, going out every night, and having fun. But her parents describe a different picture: irritability, unproductiveness, oppositional behavior, drinking to intoxication almost nightly, using various drugs like marijuana, alprazolam, cocaine, and stimulants. They say this change started around age 15, almost overnight, with her dropping old friends for new ones, getting traffic tickets, school detentions, and her grades dropping from As to Ds.\n\nI need to extract all key details. There's a significant personality change starting at 15, with behavioral issues, substance use, and academic decline. The parents mention it was sudden, which is crucial. Then there's the neuropsychological testing showing a dramatic drop in cognitive abilities from previous high scores to below average. The EEG, CT, and MRI show no structural damage except a FLAIR T2-weighted MRI indicating a lesion in the left frontal cortex.\n\nEmily later admits to a traffic accident where she hit her head, had headaches, confusion, disorientation, and vomiting. Her ex-boyfriend confirms she had a head injury with possible loss of consciousness or altered mental state for hours. This head injury seems to coincide with the onset of her symptoms around age 15.\n\nOrganizing this information: sudden personality change at 15, behavioral issues, substance use, cognitive decline, head injury with possible traumatic brain injury (TBI), left frontal cortex lesion. The timeline is important: symptoms started after the accident, which matches the parents' report of sudden change.\n\nNow, differential diagnosis. The key here is the head injury and frontal lobe lesion. That points towards a neurocognitive disorder due to TBI. The symptoms include personality changes, irritability, disinhibition, poor judgment, substance use, and cognitive decline. That fits with a major or mild neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury.\n\nSubstance use is prominent: alcohol, marijuana, alprazolam, cocaine, stimulants. That could be separate substance use disorders, but given the context, they might be secondary to the behavioral changes from the TBI. However, the substance use is significant enough to warrant its own diagnosis.\n\nOppositional behavior and conflict with parents could suggest oppositional defiant disorder, but that's usually diagnosed in younger individuals. Given her age and the onset after the injury, it's less likely as a primary diagnosis.\n\nThe sudden change rules out developmental disorders like ADHD or personality disorders, which would have an earlier onset. The cognitive decline points away from primary psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia or bipolar, which might have mood or psychotic symptoms not emphasized here.\n\nPrioritizing: the TBI-related neurocognitive disorder seems primary because it explains the abrupt change and cognitive decline. Substance use disorders are secondary but important. Maybe disruptive behavior disorder not elsewhere classified, but given the frontal lobe involvement, the behavioral issues are part of the neurocognitive disorder.\n\nICD-10 codes: major neurocognitive disorder due to TBI is F06.8. Mild neurocognitive disorder might be F06.7, but since there's significant cognitive decline affecting functioning, major is more appropriate. Substance use disorders: alcohol use disorder F10.20, cannabis use disorder F12.20, cocaine use disorder F14.20, sedative use disorder (alprazolam) F13.20, stimulant use disorder F15.20. But I need to pick the top five. Primary is the neurocognitive disorder, then substance use disorders. However, the vignette emphasizes multiple substances, so perhaps listing the most relevant ones.\n\nThe parents mentioned alcohol intoxication almost every night, so alcohol use disorder is prominent. Also, found multiple substances, so polysubstance use might be considered. But DSM-5-TR would list each substance separately if criteria are met. Given the information, alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, alprazolam, and stimulants are all mentioned. I need to select the most likely based on frequency: alcohol daily, others found in her room, so likely regular use.\n\nPerhaps the primary is major neurocognitive disorder due to TBI, then alcohol use disorder, cannabis use disorder, sedative use disorder, and cocaine use disorder. But the stimulants are prescription stimulants, so stimulant use disorder as well.\n\nWait, the top five: primary and four secondary. So primary is the neurocognitive disorder. Secondaries are substance use disorders. But there are five substances mentioned. I should prioritize based on severity: alcohol seems most frequent, then others. Alternatively, since multiple substances, polysubstance use disorder might be appropriate, but the vignette doesn't specify if she's using them simultaneously or separately.\n\nRe-reading: she drinks to intoxication almost every night, and they found small amounts of other drugs. So alcohol is daily, others might be occasional. So alcohol use disorder is definite. Others might not meet full criteria if only small amounts found, but given the context, likely use.\n\nAlso, the oppositional behavior could be part of the neurocognitive disorder, so no separate diagnosis needed.\n\nSo, final list: \n1. Major Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Traumatic Brain Injury - F06.8\n2. Alcohol Use Disorder - F10.20\n3. Cannabis Use Disorder - F12.20\n4. Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder (for alprazolam) - F13.20\n5. Cocaine Use Disorder - F14.20\n\nStimulant use disorder is also mentioned, but cocaine is a stimulant, so maybe include that. Prescription stimulants could be amphetamine-type, so F15.20, but cocaine is listed separately. Since both are mentioned, perhaps include cocaine as it's specified, and stimulant for prescription ones. But only five slots. I'll go with the ones explicitly named: alprazolam is sedative, cocaine is stimulant, so those cover the categories.\n\nAlternatively, since multiple substances, could include polysubstance use disorder, but that's for when multiple substances are used without a primary one. Here, alcohol seems primary, so separate disorders are appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the structured list as per formatting.",

    "vignette":"Frazier Archer was a 34-year-old single white man who called a mood and personality disorders research program because an ex-friend had once said he was \u201cborderline,\u201d and Mr. Archer wanted to learn more about his personality.\n\nDuring his diagnostic research interview, Mr. Archer was initially reluctant to share personal information, citing a concern that his words would be misunderstood, misconstrued, or used against him. When asked about his relationships, he described regular, almost daily situations in which he was sure he was being lied to or deceived. He was particularly wary of people in leadership positions and people who had studied psychology and, therefore, had \u201ctraining to understand the human mind,\u201d which they used to manipulate people. Unlike those around him, Mr. Archer believed he did not \u201cdrink the Kool-Aid\u201d and was able to detect manipulation and deceit.\n\nMr. Archer was employed as an assistant manager for a grocery store chain. He was extremely detail oriented at work, and had trouble delegating and completing tasks. He noted that his coworkers consistently failed to complete tasks the way that he would like. This led him to work routinely long hours \u201cfixing their mistakes.\u201d Numerous employers and colleagues had told him that he focused excessively on rules, lists, and small details, and that he needed to be more friendly. He described having held numerous jobs over the years, but he was quick to add, \u201cI\u2019ve quit as often as I\u2019ve been fired.\u201d\n\nDuring the interview, he emphasized that unlike many people, he understood the value of quality over productivity. He believed that his \u201chigh standards\u201d had contributed to his \u201cbad temper\u201d and emotional \u201cups and downs.\u201d He socialized only \u201csuperficially\u201d with a handful of acquaintances and could recall the exact moments when previous \u201cso-called friends and lovers\u201d had betrayed him. He spent most of his time alone.\n\nMr. Archer denied any significant history of trauma, any current or past problems with substance use, and any history of head trauma or loss of consciousness. He also denied any history of mental health diagnosis or treatment, but he did feel he might have a mental health condition that had not yet been diagnosed. He described some social anxiety and difficulties with academic achievement in childhood, which he attributed to his own high standards and \u201cunreliable\u201d childhood friends.\n\nOn mental status examination, Mr. Archer appeared well groomed, cooperative, and oriented. His speech varied; at times he would pause thoughtfully prior to answering questions and provide very slow, deliberate responses. At other points in the interview he became angry and offered lengthy and digressive responses. However, he seemed generally coherent and did not evidence any perceptual disturbances. His affect was occasionally inappropriate (e.g., smiling while crying) and generally constricted. He reported apathy as to whether he lived or died but did not report any active suicidal ideation or homicidal ideation.\n\nNotably, Mr. Archer became irritated and argumentative with research staff when he was told that although he could receive verbal feedback on his interviews, he could not receive a copy of the completed questionnaires and diagnostic tools. He commented that he would document in his personal records that research staff were refusing him the forms.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the clinical vignette about Frazier Archer. The user wants me to act as an expert psychiatrist and provide diagnoses based on DSM-5-TR criteria. I need to follow the rubric closely, aiming for Level 5 in both data extraction and diagnostic reasoning.\n\nFirst, I'll extract all relevant information from the vignette. Mr. Archer is a 34-year-old man concerned about his personality. He shows reluctance to share personal details, fearing misinterpretation. He has persistent suspicions of being deceived, especially by authority figures and psychologists. He's detail-oriented at work, has perfectionism, trouble delegating, and interpersonal conflicts leading to job instability. He socializes minimally, holds grudges over perceived betrayals, and spends most time alone. He denies trauma, substance use, or prior mental health treatment but acknowledges possible undiagnosed issues. On mental status exam, he's cooperative but with variable speech, occasional anger, inappropriate affect (smiling while crying), constricted affect, and passive death wishes without active suicidality. He became argumentative when denied copies of research forms.\n\nNow, organizing this data: Key themes include pervasive distrust, interpersonal difficulties, rigidity, perfectionism, emotional dysregulation, and social isolation. The mental status shows mood incongruence and irritability.\n\nFor diagnostic reasoning, I need to consider personality disorders first given the presentation. Paranoid Personality Disorder fits the pervasive distrust, suspicion of deception, reluctance to confide, and bearing grudges. Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder aligns with perfectionism, preoccupation with details, rigidity, and workaholism. Schizoid Personality Disorder is possible due to social detachment, limited friendships, and preference for solitude. Schizotypal Personality Disorder might be considered given odd beliefs (e.g., detecting manipulation by psychologists) and inappropriate affect, but no magical thinking or eccentricities are noted. Persistent Depressive Disorder could account for chronic apathy and low mood, though not explicitly stated as depressed. Avoidant Personality Disorder is less likely as he doesn't express fear of rejection but rather distrust. \n\nI should prioritize based on prominence. Paranoid and OCPD are most evident. Schizoid traits are present but less central. The affective symptoms and odd behavior might suggest schizotypal, but insufficient for full criteria. Dysthymia is a possibility given apathy and emotional ups\/downs.\n\nFinal differential: 1. Paranoid Personality Disorder (primary due to pervasive suspicion), 2. Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (secondary for rigidity\/perfectionism), 3. Schizoid Personality Disorder (tertiary for social isolation), 4. Schizotypal Personality Disorder (quaternary for odd beliefs\/affect), 5. Persistent Depressive Disorder (quinary for chronic apathy\/passive death wish).",

    "vignette":"Grzegorz Buchalski was an 87-year-old white man who was brought to the psychiatric emergency room (ER) by paramedics after they had been called to his apartment by neighbors when they noticed an odd smell. Apparently, his 90-year-old sister had died some days earlier after a lengthy illness. Mr. Buchalski had delayed reporting her death for several reasons. He had become increasingly disorganized as his sister\u2019s health had worsened, and he was worried that his landlord would use the apartment\u2019s condition as a pretext for eviction. He had tried to clean up, but his attempts consisted mainly of moving items from one place to another. He said he was about to call for help when the police and paramedics showed up.\n\nIn the ER, Mr. Buchalski recognized that his actions were odd and that he should have called for help sooner. At times, he became tearful when discussing the situation and his sister\u2019s death; at other times, he seemed aloof, speaking about these in a calm, factual way. He also wanted to clarify that his apartment had indeed been a mess but that much of the apparent mess was actually his large collection of articles on bioluminescence, a topic he had been researching for decades.\n\nA licensed plumber, electrician, and locksmith, Mr. Buchalski had worked until age 65. He described his late sister as having been always \u201ca little strange.\u201d She had never worked and had been married once, briefly. Aside from the several-month marriage, she and Mr. Buchalski had lived in the family\u2019s two-bedroom Manhattan apartment their entire lives. Neither of them had ever seen a psychiatrist.\n\nWhen questioned, Mr. Buchalski stated that he had never had a romantic or sexual relationship and had never had many friends or social contacts outside his family. He explained that he had been poor and Polish and had had to work all the time. He had taken night classes to better understand \u201cthe strange world we live in,\u201d and he said his intellectual interests were what he found most gratifying. He said he had been upset as he realized that his sister was dying, but he would call it \u201cnumb\u201d rather than depressed. He also denied any history of manic or psychotic symptoms. After an hour with the psychiatric trainee, Mr. Buchalski confided that he hoped the medical school might be interested in some of his papers after his death. He said he believed that bioluminescent and genetic technologies were on the verge of a breakthrough that might allow the skin of animals and then humans to glow in subtle colors that would allow people to more directly recognize emotions. He had written the notes for such technology, but they had grown into a \u201cway-too-long science fiction novel with lots of footnotes.\u201d\n\nOn examination, Mr. Buchalski was a thin, elderly man dressed neatly in khakis and button-down shirt. He was meticulous and much preferred to discuss his interests in science than his own story. He made appropriate eye contact and had a polite, pleasant demeanor. His speech was coherent and goal directed. His mood was \u201cfine,\u201d and his affect was appropriate though perhaps unusually cheerful under the circumstances. He denied all symptoms of psychosis, depression, and mania. Aside from his comments about bioluminescence, he said nothing that sounded delusional. He was cognitively intact, and his insight and judgment were considered generally good, although historically impaired in regard to his delay in calling the police about his sister.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let's tackle this case step by step. The user wants me to act as an expert psychiatrist following the DSM-5-TR criteria and provide a structured list of diagnoses based on the vignette. First, I need to extract all relevant clinical details from the case.\n\nThe patient is an 87-year-old man brought to the ER after his sister's death. He delayed reporting it due to disorganization and fear of eviction. His behavior seems odd, but he recognizes it. He has a lifelong pattern of limited social relationships, no romantic history, and deep intellectual interests in a niche topic. His affect shifts between tearful and aloof when discussing the death, but during the exam, he's cheerful and focused on his research. He mentions a belief about bioluminescence enabling emotion recognition but acknowledges it's like a science fiction novel with footnotes, which doesn't sound delusional.\n\nConsidering the DSM-5-TR, his lifelong social isolation, lack of relationships, and intense focus on specific interests point to a personality disorder. Schizoid Personality Disorder fits because he's detached from social relationships, prefers solitary activities, and shows emotional coldness. Although he has some odd beliefs (bioluminescence), they're not psychotic but rather eccentric interests, which aligns more with Schizotypal features. However, the vignette emphasizes his social detachment more than cognitive distortions, so Schizoid is primary.\n\nNext, the recent stress of his sister's death and his disorganized behavior could indicate an adjustment disorder. He experienced a significant stressor, leading to impaired functioning (delayed reporting, disorganization) and mixed emotional responses. Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood captures his tearfulness and numbness.\n\nHis eccentric interests and peculiar thinking (the bioluminescence project) suggest Schizotypal Personality Disorder traits. He has odd beliefs not delusional but unconventional, and his social anxiety is implied by limited friendships. Though he doesn't meet full criteria, it's a secondary consideration.\n\nHe denies depression or mania, but his affect is somewhat restricted. Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) might be considered given his chronic low mood, but he calls it \"numb\" rather than sad. However, the vignette notes he's cheerful during the exam, so this is less prominent.\n\nLastly, no evidence of psychosis or cognitive impairment, but given his age, mild neurocognitive disorders should be ruled out. However, the vignette states he's cognitively intact, so this is lower on the list.\n\nOrganizing these, the primary diagnosis is Schizoid Personality Disorder due to lifelong patterns. Then Adjustment Disorder for recent stress response, followed by Schizotypal traits, Persistent Depressive Disorder, and a rule-out for mild neurocognitive disorder.",

Although suspicious about the reason for the referral, he explained that he generally \u201cfollowed orders\u201d and would do what he was asked. He agreed that he had been suspicious of some of his classmates, believing they were undermining his abilities. He said they were telling his instructors that he was \u201ca weird guy\u201d and that they did not want him as a lab partner. The referral to the psychiatrist was, he said, confirmation of his perception.\n\nHenry described how he had seen two students \u201cflip a coin\u201d over whether he was gay or straight. Coins, he asserted, could often predict the future. He had once flipped a coin and \u201cheads\u201d had predicted his mother\u2019s illness. He believed his thoughts often came true.\n\nHenry had transferred to this out-of-town university after an initial year at his local community college. The transfer was his parents\u2019 idea, he said, and was part of their agenda to get him to be like everyone else and go to parties and hang out with girls. He said all such behavior was a waste of time. Although they had tried to push him into moving into the dorms, he had refused, and instead lived by himself in an off-campus apartment.\n\nWith Henry\u2019s permission, his mother was called for collateral information. She said Henry had been quiet, shy, and reserved since childhood. He had never had close friends, had never dated, and had denied wanting to have friends. He acknowledged feeling depressed and anxious at times, but these feelings did not improve when he was around other people. He was teased by other kids and would come home upset. His mother cried while explaining that she always felt bad for him because he never really \u201cfit in,\u201d and that she and her husband had tried to coach him for years without success. She wondered how a person could function without any social life.\n\nShe added that ghosts, telepathy, and witchcraft had fascinated Henry since junior high school. He had long thought that he could change the outcome of events like earthquakes and hurricanes by thinking about them. He had consistently denied any substance use disorder, and two drug screens had been negative in the prior 2 years. She mentioned that her grandfather had died in an \u201cinsane asylum\u201d many years before Henry was born, but she did not know his diagnosis.\n\nOn examination, Henry was tall, thin, and dressed in jeans and a T-shirt. He was alert and wary and, although nonspontaneous, he answered questions directly. He denied feeling depressed or confused. Henry denied any history of suicidal thoughts, plans, or attempts. He denied having any auditory or visual hallucinations, panic attacks, obsessions, compulsions, or phobias. His intellectual skills seemed above average, and his Mini-Mental State Examination score was 30 out of 30.",

Henry presents with odd behavior, suspiciousness, referential thinking (coin-flipping incident), magical thinking (predicting mother's illness), and long-standing social isolation.

    "vignette":"Ike Crocker was a 32-year-old white divorced carpenter referred for a mental health evaluation by the human resources department of a large construction business that had been his employer for 2 weeks. At his initial job interview, Mr. Crocker presented as very motivated and provided two carpentry school certifications that indicated a high level of skill and training. Since his employment began, his supervisors had noted frequent arguments, absenteeism, poor workmanship, and multiple errors that might have been dangerous. When confronted, he was reportedly dismissive, indicating that the problem was \u201ccheap wood\u201d and \u201cbad management\u201d and added that if someone got hurt, \u201cit\u2019s because of their own stupidity.\u201d\n\nWhen the head of human resources met with him to discuss termination, Mr. Crocker quickly pointed out that he had both attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and bipolar disorder. He said that if not granted an accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act, he would sue. He demanded a psychiatric evaluation.\n\nDuring the mental health evaluation, Mr. Crocker focused on unfairness at the company and on how he was \u201ca hell of a better carpenter than anyone there could ever be.\u201d He claimed that his two marriages had ended because of jealousy. He said that his wives were \u201calways thinking I was with other women,\u201d which is why \u201cthey both lied to judges and got restraining orders saying I\u2019d hit them.\u201d As \u201cpayback for the jail time,\u201d he refused to pay child support for his two children. He had no interest in seeing either of his two boys because they were \u201clittle liars\u201d like their mothers.\n\nMr. Crocker said he \u201cmust have been smart\u201d because he had been able to make Cs in school despite showing up only half the time. He spent time in juvenile hall at age 14 for stealing \u201ckid stuff, like tennis shoes and wallets that were practically empty.\u201d He left school at age 15 after being \u201cframed for stealing a car\u201d by his principal. Mr. Crocker pointed out these historical facts as evidence that he was able to overcome injustice and adversity. A review of a juvenile probation officer\u2019s report indicated that beginning in the first grade, he often bullied children with disabilities, was noted to smile when his victims would cry, and consistently lacked remorse or guilt for his actions.\n\nIn regard to substance use, Mr. Crocker said he smoked marijuana as a teenager and started drinking alcohol on a \u201cregular basis\u201d after he first got married at age 22. He denied that use of either substance was a problem.\n\nMr. Crocker concluded the interview by demanding a note from the examiner that he had \u201cbipolar\u201d and \u201cADHD.\u201d He said that he was \u201cbipolar\u201d because he had \u201cups and downs\u201d and got \u201cmad real fast.\u201d Mr. Crocker denied other symptoms of mania. He said he got down when disappointed, but he had \u201ca short memory\u201d and \u201ccould get out of a funk pretty quick.\u201d Mr. Crocker reported no difficulties in his sleep, mood, or appetite. He learned about ADHD because \u201cboth of my boys got it.\u201d He concluded the interview with a request for medications, adding that the only ones that worked were stimulants (\u201cany of them\u201d) and a specific short-acting benzodiazepine.\n\nOn mental status examination, Mr. Crocker was a casually dressed man who made reasonable eye contact and was without abnormal movements. His speech was coherent, goal directed, and of normal rate. There was no evidence of any thought disorder or hallucinations. He was preoccupied with blaming others, but these comments appeared to represent overvalued ideas rather than delusions. He was cognitively intact. His insight into his situation was poor.\n\nThe head of human resources did a background check during the course of the psychiatric evaluation. Phone calls revealed that Mr. Crocker had been expelled from two carpentry training programs and that both of his graduation certificates had been falsified. He had been fired from his job at one local construction company after a fistfight with his supervisor and from another job after abruptly leaving a job site. A quick review of the company\u2019s records indicated that Mr. Crocker had provided them with the same false documentation.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the clinical vignette about Ike Crocker. The user wants me to act as an expert psychiatrist and provide a structured list of DSM-5-TR diagnoses based on the information given. I need to follow the rubric for data extraction and diagnostic reasoning but not output that reasoning\u2014just the top five diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes.\n\nFirst, I'll extract all relevant details from the case. Mr. Crocker is a 32-year-old divorced carpenter referred by HR due to poor work performance, arguments, absenteeism, and dangerous errors. He blames external factors like cheap wood and bad management. He mentions ADHD and bipolar disorder but only when threatened with termination, which seems manipulative.\n\nLooking at his history: He has a pattern of interpersonal conflicts, including two failed marriages where he claims his wives were jealous and lied about abuse. He shows a lack of remorse, refusing child support and calling his children liars. His childhood involved bullying disabled children, smiling at their distress, and lacking guilt. Juvenile offenses include stealing and being expelled for car theft. He denies substance use problems but admits regular alcohol use and past marijuana use.\n\nDuring the evaluation, he displays grandiosity (\"a hell of a better carpenter\"), blames others, and has overvalued ideas but no clear delusions or hallucinations. He demands specific medications (stimulants and benzodiazepines) and falsified his certifications. Mental status exam shows coherent speech, no thought disorder, poor insight, and preoccupation with blaming others.\n\nNow, organizing this data: Key symptoms include deceitfulness, impulsivity, irritability, aggressiveness, reckless disregard for safety, lack of remorse, grandiosity, and consistent irresponsibility. These align with antisocial and narcissistic traits. The history of conduct disorder before age 15 (bullying, stealing) supports Antisocial Personality Disorder. His grandiosity, need for admiration, and lack of empathy point to Narcissistic Personality Disorder. He also shows manipulative behavior, lying, and using potential diagnoses (ADHD, bipolar) to avoid consequences, which fits Malingering. Substance use is present but not severe enough for a disorder based on the info. ADHD and bipolar are claimed but not supported by symptoms.\n\nFor differential diagnosis: Primary is likely Antisocial Personality Disorder given the conduct disorder history and persistent antisocial behaviors. Secondary diagnoses could include Narcissistic Personality Disorder, Malingering, Alcohol Use Disorder (regular use, but not enough detail for severity), and Rule-Out ADHD and Bipolar but those are ruled out due to lack of symptoms. However, the user asked for top 5 psychiatric diagnoses with F-codes, so I'll prioritize based on evidence.\n\nPrimary: Antisocial Personality Disorder (F60.2). Secondary: Narcissistic Personality Disorder (F60.81), Malingering (not an F-code, but V65.2 is Z-code, so maybe avoid? Wait, the user says \"DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses\" and \"ICD-10 F-codes,\" so Malingering is in DSM but not an F-code? Actually, in ICD-10, Malingering is Z76.5, not an F-code. So I should only include disorders with F-codes. The user specified \"Do not include non-psychiatric diagnoses that do not use F-codes.\" Malingering is considered a condition for clinical attention, not a mental disorder, so maybe exclude it. But the vignette strongly suggests it. Hmm.\n\nRe-reading the user instructions: \"Give the top 5 most likely diagnoses with corresponding ICD-10 F-codes, consisting of the primary diagnosis and 4 secondary diagnoses.\" So all must have F-codes. Therefore, I need to choose five psychiatric disorders from DSM-5-TR that have F-codes. Antisocial and Narcissistic are clear. What about Substance Use Disorders? He admits regular alcohol use, but no clear impairment mentioned except maybe interpersonal issues. Could be Alcohol Use Disorder, mild. Also, Cannabis Use Disorder? He smoked marijuana as a teenager but no recent use mentioned. Possibly Unspecified Personality Disorder? But we have specific traits. Perhaps Other Specified Personality Disorder? But Antisocial and Narcissistic cover it.\n\nMaybe include Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder? But he's an adult. Conduct Disorder is before 15, but not current. Adult Antisocial Behavior is V-code. So not that.\n\nWhat about Histrionic or Borderline traits? He has impulsivity, irritability, but not key features. More narcissistic and antisocial.\n\nAnxiety? He demands benzodiazepines, but no anxiety symptoms reported. Possibly Substance Use Disorder, Alcohol, mild (F10.10). Also, Rule-Out Stimulant Use Disorder? He asks for stimulants, but no use reported. So maybe Alcohol Use Disorder.\n\nAlso, he claims ADHD and Bipolar, but symptoms don't match. Could include Unspecified Bipolar? No manic episodes. Unspecified ADHD? No childhood symptoms described except truancy, but that's conduct-related. So not supported.\n\nSo top 5: Antisocial PD, Narcissistic PD, Alcohol Use Disorder (mild), Cannabis Use Disorder (in early remission? Not specified), and maybe Other Specified Personality Disorder with mixed features? But better to stick with what's clear.\n\nWait, the vignette says he denies other symptoms of mania, so no bipolar. Denies sleep, mood, appetite issues. So no depressive disorder. No psychosis. So personality disorders and substance use are main.\n\nBut the user wants 5 diagnoses. Possibly include Unspecified Impulse-Control Disorder? He has impulsivity in jobs, relationships. But Antisocial PD covers that.\n\nMaybe Oppositional Defiant Disorder? But he's adult, not applicable.\n\nI'll go with: 1. Antisocial PD, 2. Narcissistic PD, 3. Alcohol Use Disorder (mild), 4. Cannabis Use Disorder (in early remission, as he used as teen but not recent), 5. Malingering? But no F-code. So instead, Other Specified Personality Disorder? But we already have two PDs. Perhaps Unspecified Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder? Not supported. Better to include diagnoses that fit.\n\nActually, DSM-5-TR includes Malingering as V65.2 (Z76.5 in ICD-10), which is not an F-code. So per user instruction, don't include it. So I need five with F-codes.\n\nWhat about Conduct Disorder, adolescent-onset? But he's adult, and Antisocial PD requires conduct disorder before 15, which is noted, but Conduct Disorder itself is for individuals under 18. So not appropriate for current diagnosis.\n\nMaybe Unspecified Substance Use Disorder? But we have alcohol and cannabis.\n\nPerhaps include Adult Antisocial Behavior? That's V-code too.\n\nOkay, so I'll list: Antisocial PD, Narcissistic PD, Alcohol Use Disorder, Cannabis Use Disorder (since he used as teen, but no recent use, so possibly in remission), and maybe Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder? Not sure.\n\nWait, the bullying and lack of remorse in childhood could be Conduct Disorder, but again, he's adult. In DSM-5, for Antisocial PD, conduct disorder before 15 is a criterion, but not a separate current diagnosis.\n\nI think the top five psychiatric diagnoses with F-codes are: Antisocial PD, Narcissistic PD, Alcohol Use Disorder (mild), Cannabis Use Disorder (in sustained remission, as he used as teen but not recently), and maybe Unspecified Personality Disorder? But that's redundant.\n\nPerhaps Adjustment Disorder? He's facing job issues, but his symptoms are pervasive and long-standing, so not adjustment.\n\nAnxiety disorder? None mentioned.\n\nSo I'll go with the four clear ones and add a rule-out for something else. But the user said \"most likely diagnoses,\" so based on the vignette, personality disorders and substance use are primary. He also shows deceitfulness and manipulation, which could be part of antisocial and narcissistic, so maybe no need for fifth distinct disorder.\n\nBut the user insists on five. Maybe include Unspecified Impulse-Control Disorder? Not sure.\n\nLet's check ICD-10 F-codes: Antisocial PD is F60.2, Narcissistic PD is F60.81, Alcohol Use Disorder, mild is F10.10, Cannabis Use Disorder, in early remission is F12.11? Actually, early remission is after full criteria were met but none for at least 3 months. He used as teen, so likely in sustained remission, but not specified. Maybe F12.20 (Cannabis Use Disorder, mild or moderate, unspecified). But he denies problems, so maybe no disorder. However, he admits use, so could be mild.\n\nAlternatively, include Other Specified Personality Disorder? But we have two specific ones.\n\nPerhaps include Prolonged Grief Disorder? No.\n\nI think the safest is to list the two personality disorders, two substance use disorders (alcohol and cannabis), and since he shows symptoms of impulsivity and aggression that might not be fully captured, add Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder (F91.8) for the childhood conduct issues, but he's adult, so maybe not.\n\nWait, in DSM-5, Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder can be used for adults if criteria are met but don't fit antisocial PD? But here they do fit.\n\nMaybe Unspecified Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder? He claims ADHD but no symptoms, so unlikely.\n\nI recall that in the vignette, he claims bipolar and ADHD, but the examiner notes no symptoms. So those are ruled out. So perhaps include Malingering even without F-code? But user said don't include non-psychiatric diagnoses without F-codes. Malingering is not a mental disorder, so omit.\n\nThus, I'll list: 1. Antisocial Personality Disorder, 2. Narcissistic Personality Disorder, 3. Alcohol Use Disorder, Mild, 4. Cannabis Use Disorder, In Early Remission (if we assume he met criteria as teen), and 5. Other Specified Personality Disorder? But that might be redundant. Or Unspecified Substance Use Disorder? Not better.\n\nPerhaps include Unspecified Impulse-Control Disorder? He has impulsivity in jobs and relationships. But Antisocial PD covers it.\n\nLet's look back: He has history of stealing, fighting, reckless disregard. All part of antisocial PD. So maybe only four diagnoses. But user wants five, so I'll include a less likely one for completeness, like Unspecified Anxiety Disorder? No evidence.\n\nMaybe Rule-Out Borderline Personality Disorder? He has impulsivity, anger, unstable relationships. Could be traits. But not primary.\n\nI think I'll proceed with the four clear ones and add a fifth based on possible substance use disorder for stimulants, but he denies use, only requests meds. So perhaps Unspecified Stimulant Use Disorder? No evidence.\n\nAfter re-reading, I'll go with Alcohol Use Disorder and Cannabis Use Disorder as separate, and since he requests benzodiazepines, maybe Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder? But he hasn't used, only demands. So no.\n\nSo final list: Antisocial PD, Narcissistic PD, Alcohol Use Disorder (mild), Cannabis Use Disorder (in early remission), and for fifth, maybe Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder? But code F91.8 is for disorders usually diagnosed in childhood, so maybe not appropriate for adult diagnosis. In ICD-10, conduct disorders are for children; for adults, it's antisocial PD.\n\nPerhaps Adult Antisocial Behavior? That's Z72.81, not F-code.\n\nI think I'll include Other Specified Personality Disorder (F60.89) for mixed features of antisocial and narcissistic, but that's already covered. Hmm.\n\nMaybe include Unspecified Personality Disorder (F60.9)? But we have specified ones.\n\nGiven the vignette, the primary is Antisocial PD, and secondary are Narcissistic PD, Alcohol Use Disorder, Cannabis Use Disorder, and since he falsified documents and shows deceit, Malingering is strong, but no F-code, so I'll replace it with a substance use disorder or other. But he only used marijuana as teen and alcohol regularly, so two substance disorders. That's four. Need one more.\n\nPerhaps Adjustment Disorder with Disturbance of Conduct? But his issues are chronic, not in response to a stressor.\n\nI think I'll list Cannabis Use Disorder as one, and since he drinks regularly, Alcohol Use Disorder, and for fifth, maybe Unspecified Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder? But no symptoms. So instead, I'll include Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder? No trauma mentioned.\n\nBetter to stick to what's evident. So top 5: 1. Antisocial PD, 2. Narcissistic PD, 3. Alcohol Use Disorder, Mild, 4. Cannabis Use Disorder, In Early Remission, and 5. Other Specified Personality Disorder (with antisocial and narcissistic traits)? But that's redundant. Perhaps Prolonged Grief? No.\n\nI recall that in DSM-5, for adults with conduct disorder history but not meeting full antisocial PD, Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder can be used. But here he meets antisocial PD.\n\nAfter careful thought, I think the vignette strongly suggests Antisocial and Narcissistic PDs, and substance use disorders are less emphasized but present. He denies problems with substances, so maybe they are not disorders. But regular alcohol use after marriage could imply mild disorder. Cannabis use as teen might not meet criteria for current disorder.\n\nSo perhaps only two personality disorders and then rule out others. But user wants five, so I'll include probable substance use disorders and maybe malingering as V-code, but user said no non-psychiatric, so omit.\n\nI'll check online resources mentally: Antisocial PD F60.2, Narcissistic PD F60.81, Alcohol Use Disorder F10.10, Cannabis Use Disorder F12.10, and for fifth, since he shows impulsivity and aggression, maybe Intermittent Explosive Disorder? But no description of impulsive aggression beyond arguments and fistfight, which could be part of antisocial PD.\n\nHe had a fistfight with supervisor, so that's aggression. Intermittent Explosive Disorder requires recurrent behavioral outbursts representing failure to control aggressive impulses. He has history of bullying, fighting, but again, part of conduct disorder\/antisocial PD.\n\nI think I'll go with the personality disorders and substance use, and for fifth, add Intermittent Explosive Disorder as a possibility since he has irritability and aggression. Code F63.81.\n\nYes, that could work. So final list: Antisocial PD, Narcissistic PD, Alcohol Use Disorder mild, Cannabis Use Disorder mild in early remission, and Intermittent Explosive Disorder.\n\nBut let's confirm from vignette: He gets \"mad real fast,\" has fistfights, bullying. So intermittent explosive disorder is plausible.\n\nOkay, I'll proceed with that.",

    "vignette":"Juanita Delgado, a single, unemployed Hispanic woman, sought therapy at age 33 for treatment of depressed mood, chronic suicidal thoughts, social isolation, and poor personal hygiene. She had spent the prior 6 months isolated in her apartment, lying in bed, eating junk food, watching television, and doing more online shopping than she could afford. Multiple treatments had yielded little effect.\n\nMs. Delgado was the middle of three children in an upper-middle-class immigrant family in which the father reportedly valued professional achievement over all else. She felt isolated throughout her school years and experienced recurrent periods of depressed mood. Within her family, she was known for angry outbursts. She had done well academically in high school but dropped out of college because of frustrations with a roommate and a professor.\n\nShe had attempted a series of internships and entry-level jobs with the expectation that she would return to college, but she kept quitting because \u201cbosses are idiots. They come across as great and they all turn out to be twisted.\u201d These \u201ctraumas\u201d always left her feeling terrible about herself (\u201cI can\u2019t even succeed as a clerk?\u201d) and angry at her bosses (\u201cI could run the place and probably will\u201d). She had dated men when she was younger but never let them get close physically because she became too anxious when any intimacy began to develop. Most of her friends from the neighborhood had \u201cbecome frauds or losers,\u201d while she had stayed \u201cFacebook friends\u201d with some friends from college, and they were all \u201cdoing amazing things all over the world. I\u2019ll definitely meet up with them if they ever come back to town.\u201d\n\nMs. Delgado said that she was generally \u201cdown and depressed\u201d but that she had had dozens of 1- to 2-day \u201cmanias\u201d in which she was energized and edgy and pulled all-nighters. She tended to \u201ccrash\u201d the next day and sleep for 12 hours.\n\nMs. Delgado reported that she occasionally cut herself, \u201cbut only superficially.\u201d She had persistent thoughts that she would be better off dead, and she had been psychiatrically hospitalized three times after overdoses.\n\nShe indicated that psychotherapy had never been especially helpful, nor had her medication treatments, which had included mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and low-dose antipsychotic medication.\n\nMrs. Delgado was a casually groomed and somewhat unkempt woman who was cooperative, coherent, and goal directed during the interview. She was generally dysphoric, with a constricted affect, but did smile appropriately several times. She described shame at her poor performance but also believed she was \u201con Earth to do something great.\u201d She described her father as a spectacular success, but he was also a \u201cMachiavellian loser who was always trying to manipulate people.\u201d She described quitting jobs because people were disrespectful. Toward the end of the initial session, she became angry with the interviewer after he glanced at the clock (\u201cAre you bored already?\u201d).",

    "model_thoughts":"First, I need to diagnose the clinical case vignette for Juanita Delgado based on the DSM-5-TR criteria. I must only use the information provided and not fabricate details. My response should be a structured list of the top 5 most likely diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes, starting with the primary diagnosis followed by four secondary diagnoses.\n\nKey elements from the vignette:\n\n- Age 33, Hispanic woman, single, unemployed.\n\n- Symptoms: depressed mood, chronic suicidal thoughts, social isolation, poor personal hygiene.\n\n- Recent history: 6 months isolated in her apartment, lying in bed, eating junk food, watching TV, excessive online shopping.\n\n- Family background: upper-middle-class immigrant family, father valued professional achievement; she felt isolated, had angry outbursts.\n\n- Academic and work history: dropped out of college due to frustrations; attempted internships and jobs but quit because she thought bosses were idiots or twisted; felt terrible about herself and angry at bosses.\n\n- Social and intimate relationships: dated but avoided physical intimacy due to anxiety; friends seen as frauds or losers; maintains Facebook friends but doesn't meet them.\n\n- Mood symptoms: generally \"down and depressed,\" but had dozens of 1- to 2-day \"manias\" with energy, edginess, pulling all-nighters, followed by crashes and sleeping 12 hours.\n\n- Self-harm: occasional superficial cutting.\n\n- Suicidality: persistent thoughts of being better off dead, three psychiatric hospitalizations after overdoses.\n\n- Treatment history: psychotherapy not helpful; medications including mood stabilizers, antidepressants, low-dose antipsychotics with little effect.\n\n- Mental status exam: casually groomed, unkempt; cooperative, coherent, goal-directed; dysphoric with constricted affect but smiles appropriately; describes shame but also belief in greatness; views father negatively; angry outburst during interview.\n\nNow, I need to extract and organize this data to support my diagnostic reasoning, aiming for Level 5 performance as per the rubric. But my response should only be the list of diagnoses, not the reasoning. However, I need to think through the diagnoses carefully.\n\nPrimary diagnosis likely involves mood and personality features. Key symptoms suggest a mood disorder with depressive episodes and hypomanic or manic episodes. She reports \"manias\" that last 1-2 days, but DSM-5-TR requires at least 4 days for hypomania and 7 days for mania. However, she has dozens of these episodes, which might indicate a bipolar spectrum disorder. Given the chronicity and treatment resistance, it could be Bipolar II Disorder or Cyclothymic Disorder, but the episodes are very brief. Perhaps Other Specified Bipolar and Related Disorder if criteria aren't fully met.\n\nAlso, there are persistent interpersonal difficulties, anger, unstable self-image, fear of intimacy, and suicidal behavior, which point to Borderline Personality Disorder. Self-harm, chronic suicidal thoughts, unstable relationships, anger, and identity disturbance are evident.\n\nShe has depressive symptoms, but with hypomanic episodes, so unipolar depression might not fit. However, the depressive episodes seem chronic.\n\nConsidering the differential:\n\n1. **Bipolar II Disorder**: Depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes. Her \"manias\" are 1-2 days, which is shorter than the 4-day minimum for hypomania. So, it might not meet full criteria. But she has dozens of them, and with treatment resistance, it's plausible. ICD-10 code: F31.81 for Bipolar II Disorder.\n\n2. **Cyclothymic Disorder**: Numerous periods of hypomanic and depressive symptoms that don't meet full criteria for episodes, lasting for at least 2 years. She's 33, and symptoms have been recurrent since school years, so this could fit. ICD-10 code: F34.0.\n\n3. **Borderline Personality Disorder**: Key features: frantic efforts to avoid abandonment (not explicitly stated, but she avoids intimacy), unstable relationships, identity disturbance, impulsivity (shopping, quitting jobs), recurrent suicidal behavior, affective instability, chronic feelings of emptiness (implied by isolation and depression), inappropriate anger (angry outbursts), and transient stress-related paranoid ideation (thinking bosses are twisted). ICD-10 code: F60.3.\n\n4. **Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)**: Chronic depressed mood for years, but with hypomanic episodes, it might be better explained by a bipolar disorder.\n\n5. **Other Specified Bipolar and Related Disorder**: If the hypomanic episodes are too short, this could be specified. ICD-10 code: F31.89.\n\n6. **Major Depressive Disorder**: But with hypomanic episodes, it's less likely.\n\n7. **Narcissistic Personality Disorder**: She believes she is \"on Earth to do something great,\" has grandiosity, and devalues others (bosses are idiots, friends are frauds). But core features of BPD seem more prominent.\n\n8. **Avoidant Personality Disorder**: Fear of intimacy, social isolation, but she has anger and grandiosity, which might not fit.\n\n9. **Schizotypal Personality Disorder**: Social isolation, odd beliefs? Not really.\n\nGiven the chronic suicidal thoughts and self-harm, Borderline Personality Disorder is a strong candidate.\n\nThe primary diagnosis should be the most encompassing or severe. Considering the mood episodes and personality traits, I think Borderline Personality Disorder might be primary because it explains the interpersonal issues, anger, self-harm, and suicidality, along with affective instability.\n\nBut the mood episodes are significant. DSM-5-TR allows for comorbid personality disorders and mood disorders. So, I can list both.\n\nOrder of listing: Primary diagnosis is the main condition. Based on the vignette, she sought treatment for depressed mood, etc., but the chronic pattern suggests personality pathology.\n\nLet's list the top 5:\n\n- Primary: Borderline Personality Disorder - F60.3\n\n- Secondary: Bipolar II Disorder or Other Specified Bipolar Disorder. Since hypomanic episodes are brief, perhaps Other Specified Bipolar and Related Disorder with short-duration hypomanic episodes. ICD-10: F31.89 for Other bipolar affective disorders.\n\n- Another secondary: Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) - F34.1, if considering chronic depression.\n\n- But to have 5 diagnoses, I need to include relevant ones.\n\nEnsure diagnoses are psychiatric with F-codes.\n\nPossible list:\n\n1. Borderline Personality Disorder - F60.3\n\n2. Other Specified Bipolar and Related Disorder - F31.89 (due to short hypomanic episodes)\n\n3. Persistent Depressive Disorder - F34.1 (chronic depressive symptoms)\n\n4. Other Specified Depressive Disorder - if not meeting full criteria for persistent depressive.\n\n5. Narcissistic Personality Traits or Disorder? But not fully meeting criteria.\n\nShe has features of narcissism, but might not meet full criteria for Narcissistic Personality Disorder. I can include Other Personality Disorder or Traits, but DSM-5-TR has specific codes.\n\nICD-10 codes for personality disorders: F60.3 for borderline, F60.8 for other specific personality disorders, F60.9 for unspecified.\n\nFor mood disorders: F31 for bipolar, F32 for depressive episodes, F33 for recurrent depressive disorder, F34 for persistent mood disorders.\n\nGiven the information, the most supported diagnoses are:\n\n- Borderline Personality Disorder: clear evidence with suicidal behavior, self-harm, anger, unstable relationships, identity issues.\n\n- A bipolar spectrum disorder: with hypomanic episodes, even if short.\n\n- Chronic depression.\n\n- Possibly an anxiety disorder related to intimacy, but not specified.\n\nShe has anxiety with intimacy, but no formal anxiety disorder diagnosis mentioned.\n\nShe has social isolation, but not necessarily social anxiety disorder.\n\nFrom the vignette: \"became too anxious when any intimacy began to develop\" \u2013 this could be part of borderline or avoidant personality.\n\nTo list 5 diagnoses, I can include:\n\n1. Borderline Personality Disorder\n\n2. Other Specified Bipolar and Related Disorder\n\n3. Persistent Depressive Disorder\n\n4. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder (for intimacy anxiety) - F41.8\n\n5. Narcissistic Personality Disorder - F60.8? But evidence is limited.\n\nBetter to stick to what's strongly supported.\n\nReview symptoms: depressed mood, suicidal thoughts, isolation, poor hygiene \u2013 depressive symptoms.\n\nHypomanic symptoms: energized, edgy, all-nighters, but only 1-2 days.\n\nPersonality: angry outbursts, unstable self-image, fear of abandonment (implied), impulsivity (shopping, quitting jobs), self-harm.\n\nSo, comorbid personality and mood disorder.\n\nDSM-5-TR: Bipolar II requires at least one hypomanic episode and one major depressive episode. Her depressive episodes seem chronic, but are they major? She has depressed mood, isolation, etc., which could meet criteria for major depressive episode, but it's chronic. With hypomanic episodes too short, it might be Other Specified.\n\nCyclothymic requires numerous periods of hypomanic and depressive symptoms for 2 years without meeting full episode criteria, and no major depressive episode. She has had depressive periods since school, so possibly.\n\nLet's check duration: \"recurrent periods of depressed mood\" since school, and \"dozens of 1- to 2-day 'manias'\". For cyclothymic, hypomanic symptoms need to not meet full criteria for an episode, which they don't due to duration, and depressive symptoms similarly. And it lasts at least 2 years. She's 33, so likely.\n\nBut she has suicidal behavior and hospitalizations, which might indicate more severe episodes.\n\nI think Borderline Personality Disorder is a key diagnosis.\n\nPrimary diagnosis: Borderline Personality Disorder - F60.3\n\nSecondary: Other Specified Bipolar and Related Disorder - F31.89 (with short-duration hypomanic episodes)\n\nSecondary: Persistent Depressive Disorder - F34.1 (dysthymia)\n\nSecondary: Other Specified Anxiety Disorder - F41.8 (for anxiety with intimacy, not otherwise specified)\n\nSecondary: Narcissistic Personality Disorder - F60.8? But let's see if there's enough. She has grandiosity (\"on Earth to do something great\"), devaluation of others (bosses, father), but lacks other criteria like need for admiration. It might be traits, but for diagnosis, I can include if it meets.\n\nFrom vignette: \"believed she was 'on Earth to do something great'\" and devalues others, so possible Narcissistic PD.\n\nBut to be conservative, I'll list diagnoses strongly supported.\n\nAnother option: Adjustment Disorder? No, chronic.\n\nSubstance use? Not mentioned.\n\nEating disorder? Not mentioned.\n\nOCD? No.\n\nPTSD? No trauma mentioned, except \"traumas\" from jobs, but not criterion A.\n\nSo, top 5:\n\n1. Borderline Personality Disorder - F60.3\n\n2. Other Specified Bipolar and Related Disorder - F31.89\n\n3. Persistent Depressive Disorder - F34.1\n\n4. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder - F41.8\n\n5. Other Specified Personality Disorder - F60.8 (if including narcissistic traits, but better to specify)\n\nI can list Narcissistic Personality Disorder if I think it meets criteria.\n\nFrom DSM-5-TR, Narcissistic PD requires grandiosity, need for admiration, lack of empathy, etc. She shows grandiosity, but need for admiration? She compares herself to friends, but not clearly. Lack of empathy? She devalues others, but not explicitly. So, might not be full.\n\nPerhaps Avoidant Personality Disorder for intimacy anxiety, but she has anger and grandiosity, which are not typical.\n\nIn the vignette, she avoids intimacy due to anxiety, which could be social anxiety or avoidant PD.\n\nBut for differential, I need to list most likely.\n\nGiven her history, Borderline PD is central.\n\nLet's prioritize:\n\n- Primary: Borderline Personality Disorder - F60.3\n\n- Secondary: Cyclothymic Disorder - F34.0 (since hypomanic and depressive symptoms are chronic and recurrent)\n\n- Secondary: Persistent Depressive Disorder - F34.1 (but cyclothymic already covers persistent mood symptoms; they might be comorbid, but cyclothymic excludes major depressive episodes).\n\nCyclothymic Disorder is characterized by numerous periods of hypomanic and depressive symptoms that do not meet full criteria for episodes, and no major depressive episode. She has had overdoses and hospitalizations, which might indicate major depressive episodes, so perhaps not cyclothymic.\n\nOther Specified Bipolar and Related Disorder with short-duration hypomanic episodes and major depressive episodes.\n\nShe has \"depressed mood\" chronically, but for major depressive episode, need specific criteria. From vignette: depressed mood, suicidal thoughts, isolation, poor hygiene, which could include symptoms like depressed mood, loss of interest (isolation), worthlessness (shame), psychomotor changes (lying in bed), etc., so possible major depressive episode.\n\nBut it's chronic, so Persistent Depressive Disorder might include major depressive episodes.\n\nDSM-5-TR: Persistent Depressive Disorder can have major depressive episodes superimposed.\n\nI think for simplicity, given the hypomanic episodes, a bipolar diagnosis is warranted.\n\nAfter thinking, I'll go with:\n\n1. Borderline Personality Disorder - F60.3 (primary)\n\n2. Other Specified Bipolar and Related Disorder - F31.89 (for bipolar-like episodes not meeting full criteria)\n\n3. Persistent Depressive Disorder - F34.1 (for chronic depression)\n\n4. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder - F41.8 (for intimacy anxiety)\n\n5. Narcissistic Personality Disorder - F60.8 (for grandiosity and devaluation)\n\nBut to ensure accuracy, let's see if there's enough for narcissistic PD. She has grandiosity, believes in her greatness, devalues others (bosses, father), and has interpersonal issues. It might meet criteria, but borderline might overshadow.\n\nIn clinical practice, comorbid personality disorders are common.\n\nI recall that in the vignette, she has \"angry outbursts\" which is more borderline, but narcissistic can have anger too.\n\nFor the list, I need to output only the diagnoses.\n\nAnother idea: since she has treatment resistance and multiple symptoms, perhaps Schizoaffective Disorder? But no psychotic symptoms mentioned.\n\nShe describes bosses as \"twisted,\" which might be paranoid ideation, but not psychotic.\n\n\"Machiavellian loser\" \u2013 not delusional.\n\nSo, no psychosis.\n\nFinal list:\n\n1. Borderline Personality Disorder - F60.3\n\n2. Other Specified Bipolar and Related Disorder - F31.89\n\n3. Persistent Depressive Disorder - F34.1\n\n4. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder - F41.8\n\n5. Narcissistic Personality Disorder - F60.8\n\nI think this covers the key features.\n\nTo be more precise, I could replace Other Specified Anxiety Disorder with Social Anxiety Disorder, but intimacy anxiety might not fit social anxiety perfectly.\n\nSocial Anxiety Disorder: fear of social situations due to negative evaluation. She avoids intimacy due to anxiety, which could be social, but not specified.\n\nI'll stick with the above.\n\nNow, format the response as per instructions:\n\n1. <Primary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n\n2. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n\n3. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n\n4. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n\n5. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n\nNo reasoning, just the list.",

    "vignette":"Karmen Fuentes was a 50-year-old married Hispanic woman who presented to the psychiatric emergency room (ER) at the urging of her outpatient psychiatrist after telling him that she had been thinking about overdosing on Advil.\n\nIn the ER, Ms. Fuentes explained that her back had been \u201ckilling\u201d her since she fell several days earlier at the family-owned grocery store where she had worked for many years. The fall had left her downcast and depressed, although she denied other depressive symptoms aside from a poor mood. She spoke at length about the fall and about how it reminded her of a fall that she had sustained a few years earlier. At that time, she had gone to see a neurosurgeon, who told her to rest and take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. She described feeling \u201cabandoned and not cared about\u201d by him. The pain had diminished her ability to exercise, and she was upset that she had gained weight. While relating the events surrounding the fall, Ms. Fuentes began to cry.\n\nWhen asked about her suicidal comments, she said they were \u201cno big deal\u201d\u2014they were \u201cjust a threat\u201d aimed at her husband to \u201cteach him a lesson\u201d because \u201che has no compassion for me\u201d and had not been supportive since the fall. She insisted that her comments about overdosing did not have another meaning. When her ER interviewer expressed concern about the possibility that she would kill herself, she exclaimed with a smile, \u201cOh wow, I didn\u2019t realize it\u2019s so serious. I guess I shouldn\u2019t do that again.\u201d She then shrugged and laughed. She went on to talk about how \u201cnice and sweet\u201d it was that so many doctors and social workers wanted to hear her story, calling many of them by their first names. She was also somewhat flirtatious with her male resident interviewer, who had mentioned that she was the \u201cbest-dressed woman in the ER.\u201d\n\nAccording to her outpatient psychiatrist of 3 years, she had never before expressed suicidal ideation until this week, and he would be unable to check in on her until after he left on vacation the next day. Ms. Fuentes\u2019s husband reported that she talked about suicide \u201clike other people complain about the weather. She\u2019s just trying to get me worried, but it doesn\u2019t work anymore.\u201d He said he would never have suggested she go to the ER and thought the psychiatrist had overreacted.\n\nMs. Fuentes initially sought outpatient psychotherapy at age 47 because she was feeling depressed and unsupported by her husband. During 3 years of outpatient treatment, Ms. Fuentes had been prescribed adequate trials of sertraline, escitalopram, fluoxetine, and paroxetine. None seemed to help.\n\nMs. Fuentes described being \u201can early bloomer.\u201d She became sexually active with older men when she was in high school. She said dating had been the most fun thing she had ever done and that she missed seeing men \u201cjump through hoops\u201d to sleep with her. She lived with her 73-year-old husband. Her 25-year-old son lived nearby with his wife and young son. She described her husband as a \u201cvery famous\u201d musician.

    "model_thoughts":"First, I need to diagnose this clinical case vignette based on the information provided. I must follow the rubric for Data Extraction and Organization and Diagnostic Reasoning and Differential Diagnosis, but I'm not supposed to output my clinical reasoning. My response should only be a structured list of the top 5 most likely DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses with corresponding ICD-10 F-codes.\n\nKey points from the vignette:\n\n- Karmen Fuentes, 50-year-old married Hispanic woman.\n\n- Presented to ER due to suicidal thoughts about overdosing on Advil.\n\n- Recent fall causing back pain, leading to feeling downcast and depressed, but denies other depressive symptoms aside from poor mood.\n\n- History of a similar fall a few years ago, felt abandoned by the neurosurgeon.\n\n- Pain reduced ability to exercise, upset about weight gain.\n\n- Cried when talking about the fall.\n\n- Suicidal comments described as \"no big deal,\" a threat to teach her husband a lesson due to lack of support.\n\n- When confronted, she smiled, shrugged, laughed, and said she shouldn't do it again.\n\n- She was flirtatious with the male interviewer, called staff by first names, described as \"best-dressed.\"\n\n- Outpatient psychiatrist of 3 years notes no prior suicidal ideation until this week, and he's going on vacation.\n\n- Husband says she talks about suicide casually, like complaining about the weather, and thinks it's for attention.\n\n- Treatment history: Tried sertraline, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine \u2013 none helped for depression.\n\n- Sought therapy at age 47 due to feeling depressed and unsupported by husband.\n\n- Described as \"an early bloomer,\" sexually active with older men in high school, missed dating and attention from men.\n\n- Husband is 73, famous musician, unhelpful at home, doesn't appreciate her work with son and grandson.\n\nNow, I need to extract relevant information for diagnosis:\n\n- Mood: Depressed mood related to physical pain and lack of support, but denies other depressive symptoms. However, she has a history of depression for which she sought therapy and tried multiple SSRIs without success.\n\n- Behavior: Suicidal ideation as a threat, attention-seeking, flirtatious, dramatic presentation (crying, smiling, laughing inappropriately).\n\n- Interpersonal relationships: Feels unsupported by husband, history of seeking attention from men, dissatisfaction with marriage.\n\n- Personality traits: Histrionic or borderline features? She shows emotional instability, attention-seeking, flirtatiousness, and manipulative behavior with suicidal threats.\n\n- Response to treatment: Treatment-resistant depression with SSRIs.\n\nConsidering DSM-5-TR diagnoses:\n\n1. **Primary Diagnosis**: Likely a personality disorder. Given her attention-seeking, dramatic behavior, flirtatiousness, and manipulative use of suicidal threats, **Histrionic Personality Disorder** seems prominent. Also, elements of emotional instability and fear of abandonment might suggest **Borderline Personality Disorder**, but the vignette emphasizes attention-seeking and seductiveness more.\n\n2. **Secondary Diagnoses**:\n\n   - **Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) or Major Depressive Disorder**: She has a history of depression, sought therapy for it, and tried multiple antidepressants without success. However, she denies full depressive symptoms currently, but the chronic nature suggests Persistent Depressive Disorder.\n\n   - **Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood**: The recent fall and pain triggered depressive symptoms, but it might be acute.\n\n   - **Somatic Symptom Disorder or Related**: She focuses on pain and physical symptoms, but not enough for a primary somatic disorder.\n\n   - **Other Specified or Unspecified Depressive Disorder**: Given treatment resistance.\n\n   - **Rule out Bipolar or Other Mood Disorders**: No indication of mania or hypomania.\n\n   - **Anxiety Disorders**: Not mentioned.\n\n   - **Substance Use**: Not mentioned.\n\nFrom the vignette, her suicidal ideation seems manipulative and not serious, which is common in personality disorders. Her flirtatiousness and need for attention point to Histrionic Personality Disorder.\n\nDSM-5-TR criteria for Histrionic Personality Disorder: A pervasive pattern of excessive emotionality and attention-seeking, including discomfort when not the center of attention, inappropriate seductiveness, rapidly shifting and shallow emotions, use of physical appearance to draw attention, dramatic speech, exaggerated emotions, and suggestibility.\n\nShe shows: excessive emotionality (crying, dramatic presentation), attention-seeking (flirtatious, calling staff by first names, enjoying the attention), seductiveness (flirtatious with interviewer), shallow emotions (quick shift from crying to smiling), and manipulative behavior with suicidal threats.\n\nFor Borderline Personality Disorder: Fear of abandonment, unstable relationships, identity disturbance, impulsivity, suicidal behavior, affective instability, chronic feelings of emptiness, inappropriate anger, transient paranoid ideation. She shows some affective instability and suicidal threats, but not clear on other criteria. Husband's lack of support might trigger fear of abandonment, but not explicitly stated.\n\nDepression: She has a history, but current episode might be secondary to adjustment or personality.\n\nICD-10 F-codes:\n\n- Histrionic Personality Disorder: F60.4\n\n- Borderline Personality Disorder: F60.3\n\n- Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia): F34.1\n\n- Major Depressive Disorder, single or recurrent episode: F32.x or F33.x, but since it's chronic, F34.1 might be better.\n\n- Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood: F43.21\n\n- Other Specified Depressive Disorder: F32.89\n\n- Unspecified Depressive Disorder: F32.9\n\nGiven the vignette, primary diagnosis should be Histrionic Personality Disorder. Then, secondary diagnoses could include depressive disorders.\n\nList top 5:\n\n1. Primary: Histrionic Personality Disorder\n\n2. Secondary: Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)\n\n3. Secondary: Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood (due to recent fall)\n\n4. Secondary: Other Specified Personality Disorder (if mixed features)\n\n5. Secondary: Rule out Borderline Personality Disorder\n\nBut I need to base only on information provided. She has traits of both histrionic and borderline, but histrionic seems more fitting.\n\nAlso, treatment-resistant depression is key.\n\nLet's prioritize:\n\n- Most prominent: Personality disorder traits.\n\n- Chronic depression.\n\n- Acute adjustment issue.\n\n- Possible unspecified disorders.\n\nFormat: 1. <Primary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code, then 2-5 secondary with F-codes.\n\nEnsure diagnoses are psychiatric and use F-codes.\n\nFinal list:\n\n1. Histrionic Personality Disorder - F60.4\n\n2. Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) - F34.1\n\n3. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood - F43.21\n\n4. Other Specified Depressive Disorder - F32.89 (if dysthymia isn't full, but she has chronic depression)\n\n5. Borderline Personality Disorder - F60.3 (as a secondary consideration)\n\nBut Persistent Depressive Disorder might cover the chronic depression. Adjustment Disorder is for recent stressor.\n\nPerhaps:\n\n1. Histrionic Personality Disorder - F60.4\n\n2. Persistent Depressive Disorder - F34.1\n\n3. Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood? But only depressed mood mentioned.\n\nFrom vignette: \"depressed and unsupported\" \u2013 chronic, so Persistent Depressive Disorder.\n\nAdjustment Disorder due to fall.\n\nBorderline features.\n\nAnother possibility: Unspecified Personality Disorder with mixed features.\n\nBut I think Histrionic is primary.\n\nResponse should only be the list, no reasoning.\n\nSo, structured list:\n\n1. Histrionic Personality Disorder - F60.4\n\n2. Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) - F34.1\n\n3. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood - F43.21\n\n4. Borderline Personality Disorder - F60.3\n\n5. Other Specified Depressive Disorder - F32.89 (for treatment-resistant aspect)\n\nOr replace with Unspecified Depressive Disorder.\n\nI think Persistent Depressive Disorder is appropriate given the chronicity.\n\nTo be precise, based on DSM-5-TR, if she has depressed mood for most of the day, more days than not, for at least two years, it could be Persistent Depressive Disorder. She sought therapy at 47, now 50, so three years, and tried multiple meds.\n\nAdjustment Disorder is for the recent fall.\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder is a differential.\n\nAnother secondary could be Somatic Symptom Disorder, but not enough criteria.\n\nI'll go with this.",

    "vignette":"Larry Goranov was a 57-year-old man who demanded an expert review of the psychiatric care that he had received for the prior 7 years at a psychiatric clinic connected to a medical school. Mr. Goranov indicated to the clinic\u2019s psychiatric director that he had been depressed for many years, but weekly psychotherapy and multiple different psychiatric medications had made no difference.\n\nMr. Goranov reported feeling sad, tired, and frustrated \u201cfor decades.\u201d He rarely looked forward to anything. He had lost his last job 3 years earlier, had broken up with a girlfriend slightly later, and doubted that he would ever work or date again. He was embarrassed that he still lived with his mother, who was in her 80s. He denied any immediate intention or plan to kill himself, but stated that if he did not improve by the time his mother died, he did not see what he would have to live for. He denied disturbances in sleep, appetite, or concentration.\n\nClinic records indicated that Mr. Goranov had been adherent to adequate trials of fluoxetine, escitalopram, sertraline, duloxetine, venlafaxine, and bupropion, as well as augmentation with quetiapine, aripiprazole, lithium, and levothyroxine. He had experienced some improvement in his mood while taking escitalopram but did not have remission of symptoms. He also received a course of cognitive-behavioral therapy early in his treatment, but he had been dismissive of the therapist and treatment, did not do his assigned homework, and appeared to make no effort to use the therapy between sessions.\n\nMr. Goranov expressed frustration at his lack of improvement, the nature of his treatment, and his specific therapy. He found it \u201chumiliating\u201d that he was forced to see trainees who rotated off his case every year or two. He frequently found that the psychiatry residents were not especially educated, cultured, or sophisticated, and thought that they knew less about psychotherapy than he did. He much preferred to work with female therapists \u201cbecause at least they\u2019re pretty, and men are too competitive and envious.\u201d\n\nMr. Goranov had worked as an insurance broker from age 25 to 40. He explained, \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous. I was the best broker they had ever seen, but I still can\u2019t get a job. I think the problem is that the profession is filled with big egos, and I can\u2019t keep my mouth shut about it.\u201d After being \u201cblackballed\u201d by insurance agencies, Mr. Goranov did not work for 5 years, until he was hired by an automobile dealer. He said that although it was beneath him to sell cars, he was successful, and \u201cin no time, I was running the place.\u201d He quit within a few months after an argument with the owner. Despite encouragement from several therapists, Mr. Goranov had not applied for a job or pursued employment rehabilitation or volunteer work; he strongly viewed these options as beneath him.\n\nMr. Goranov has \u201cgiven up on women.\u201d He had many partners as a younger man, but he generally found them to be unappreciative and \u201conly in it for the free meals.\u201d Psychotherapy notes from the clinic indicate that he responded to demonstrations of interest with suspicion. This tendency held true in regard to both women who had tried to befriend him and therapists who had taken an interest in his care. Mr. Goranov described himself as someone who had a lot of love to give, but added that the world was full of manipulators. He said he had a few buddies, but his mother was the only one he truly cared about. His parents had emigrated from Eastern Europe when he was a child. He had no siblings, and his father had died when the patient was 41. He had met a few relatives over the years, \u201cbut they didn\u2019t speak English, so I didn\u2019t pay them much attention.\u201d He enjoyed fine restaurants and \u201cfive-star hotels,\u201d but he added that he could no longer afford them. He exercised daily and was concerned about maintaining his body. Most of his time was spent at home watching television or reading novels and biographies.\n\nOn examination, the patient was neatly groomed, had slicked-back hair, and wore designer hip-hop-inspired clothing generally favored by men in their 20s. He was coherent, goal directed, and generally cooperative. He said he was sad and angry. His affect was constricted and dismissive. He denied an intention to kill himself but felt hopeless and thought of death fairly often. He was cognitively intact.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the clinical vignette about Larry Goranov. The user wants me to diagnose based on DSM-5-TR criteria, providing a structured list with ICD-10 F-codes. I need to extract all relevant details and organize them logically to support my reasoning.\n\nFirst, Larry is 57, with a long history of depressive symptoms but no improvement despite multiple treatments. He reports chronic sadness, fatigue, frustration, anhedonia, and hopelessness. Notable here is the lack of neurovegetative symptoms like sleep or appetite disturbances. He's unemployed, lives with his mother, and has relationship failures. Despite adequate trials of various antidepressants and augmenting agents, only partial improvement with escitalopram occurred. He's dismissive of therapy, non-adherent to homework, and critical of therapists.\n\nHis personality traits stand out: grandiosity (claims he was the best broker, ran the car dealership quickly), entitlement (frustrated with trainees, finds jobs beneath him), interpersonal difficulties (suspicion of others' intentions, seeing women as manipulative), and unstable relationships. He dresses inappropriately for his age, is preoccupied with maintaining his appearance, and has a constricted, dismissive affect.\n\nConsidering the chronicity, lack of response to treatment, and pervasive personality dysfunction, this seems more aligned with a personality disorder rather than a primary mood disorder. The grandiosity, need for admiration, lack of empathy, and interpersonal exploitation point towards Narcissistic Personality Disorder. His chronic depressive symptoms could be secondary to this, possibly Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia), given the duration and lack of full remission.\n\nBut wait, he also shows suspiciousness and distrust, which might suggest Paranoid Personality traits. However, the grandiosity and entitlement are more prominent. His hopelessness and passive suicidal ideation without intent or plan indicate depressive features, but not major depressive disorder due to absent neurovegetative symptoms and the chronic, pervasive nature.\n\nOther differentials: Adjustment Disorder? Unlikely because the stressors (job loss, breakup) are not recent, and symptoms predate them. Other Personality Disorders like Borderline or Antisocial? Borderline lacks the instability in relationships and self-image here; Antisocial doesn't fit as there's no mention of unlawful behavior. Maybe Obsessive-Compulsive Personality? No perfectionism or rigidity noted.\n\nSo, primary diagnosis likely Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Secondary: Persistent Depressive Disorder, given chronic low mood. Then rule out other personality traits like paranoid or borderline. Also, consider Unspecified Depressive Disorder if dysthymia doesn't fully capture it. But the vignette emphasizes personality pathology, so personality disorders should be prioritized.\n\nNow, ICD-10 codes: F60.81 for Narcissistic Personality Disorder, F34.1 for Persistent Depressive Disorder. For other personality traits, maybe F60.0 for Paranoid Personality Disorder traits, but it's not full-blown. Alternatively, F60.3 for Borderline traits, but less likely. Could include F32.9 for Unspecified Depressive Disorder as a catch-all. However, the user asked for top 5 diagnoses, so I need to list the most likely ones in order.\n\nLet me double-check the criteria. Larry exhibits grandiosity, need for admiration, lack of empathy, entitlement, and interpersonal exploitation. Yes, that fits Narcissistic PD. Chronic depressive symptoms for decades with hopelessness but no major depressive episodes? That's Persistent Depressive Disorder. His suspiciousness might be part of narcissistic injury rather than paranoid PD. So, secondary could be Paranoid Personality Traits as a rule-out. Also, his social isolation and disdain for others might indicate Schizoid traits, but he seeks admiration, so not schizoid. Maybe Histrionic? No dramatic attention-seeking noted.\n\nAnother thought: Treatment-Resistant Depression is implied, but that's not a DSM diagnosis. So, stick with the personality disorder as primary. Additionally, he might have Unspecified Personality Disorder with narcissistic and paranoid traits, but specific PD is better if criteria met.\n\nFinally, list the diagnoses in order of likelihood with ICD-10 codes. Ensure no non-psychiatric diagnoses and only F-codes. The primary is Narcissistic PD, then Persistent Depressive Disorder, followed by other personality traits or disorders as differentials.",

    "vignette":"Mathilda Herbert was a 23-year-old woman referred for psychiatric consultation to help her \u201cbreak out of her shell.\u201d She had recently moved to a new city to take classes to become an industrial lab technician and had moved in with an older cousin, who was also a psychotherapist and thought she should \u201cget out and enjoy her youth.\u201d\n\nAlthough she had previously been prescribed medications for anxiety, Ms. Herbert said that her real problem was \u201cshyness.\u201d School was difficult because everyone was constantly \u201ccriticizing.\u201d She avoided being called on in class because she knew she would \u201csay something stupid\u201d and blush and everyone would make fun of her. She avoided speaking up or talking on telephones, worried about how she would sound. She dreaded public speaking.\n\nShe was similarly reticent with friends. She said she had always been a people pleaser who preferred to hide her feelings with a cheerful, compliant, attentive demeanor. She had a few friends, whom she described as \u201cwarm and lifelong.\u201d She felt lonely after her recent move and had not yet met anyone from school or the local community.\n\nShe said she had broken up with her first serious boyfriend 2 years earlier. He had initially been \u201ckind and patient.\u201d Through him, she had a social life by proxy. Soon after she moved in with him, however, he turned out to be an \u201cangry alcoholic.\u201d She had not dated since that experience.\n\nMs. Herbert grew up in a metropolitan area with her parents and three older siblings. Her brother was \u201chyperactive and antisocial\u201d and took up everyone\u2019s attention, whereas her sisters were \u201chypercompetitive and perfect.\u201d Her mother was anxiously compliant, \u201clike me.\u201d Ms. Herbert\u2019s father was a very successful investment manager who often pointed out ways in which his children did not live up to his expectations. He could be supportive but tended to disregard emotional uncertainty in favor of a \u201ctough optimism.\u201d Teasing and competition \u201csaturated\u201d the household, and \u201cit didn\u2019t help that I was forced to go to the same girls\u2019 school where my sisters had been stars and where everyone was rich and catty.\u201d She developed a keen sensitivity to criticism and failure.\n\nHer parents divorced during her senior year of high school. Her father married another woman soon thereafter. Although she had planned to attend the same elite university as her two sisters, she chose to attend a local community college at the last minute. She explained that it was good to be away from all the competition, and her mother needed the support.\n\nMs. Herbert\u2019s strengths included excellent work in her major, chemistry, especially after one senior professor took a special interest. Family camping trips had led to a mastery of outdoor skills, and she found that she enjoyed being out in the woods, flexing her independence. She also enjoyed babysitting and volunteering in animal shelters, because kids and animals \u201cappreciate everything you do and aren\u2019t mean.\u201d\n\nDuring the evaluation, Ms. Herbert was a well-dressed young woman of short stature who was attentive, coherent, and goal directed. She smiled a lot, especially when talking about things that would have made most people angry. When the psychiatrist offered a trial comment, linking Ms. Herbert\u2019s current anxiety to experiences with her father, the patient said nothing but was visibly upset. After several such instances, the psychiatrist worried that any interpretive comments might be taken as criticism and had to check a tendency to avoid sensitive subjects. Explicitly discussing his concerns led both the patient and psychiatrist to relax and allowed the conversation to continue more productively.",

The patient exhibits pervasive social anxiety with fear of criticism, avoidance of social situations, and physical symptoms like blushing. This aligns strongly with Social Anxiety Disorder. She also shows longstanding interpersonal sensitivity, avoidance, and negative self-view, suggesting Avoidant Personality Disorder as a core issue.\n\nThe history of prior anxiety medication and current adjustment to major life changes (moving, new school) supports Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety. While she describes past family dysfunction, there's no clear evidence of acute trauma meeting PTSD criteria, but it's worth considering given the stressful household environment.

He wished someone would tell him where to go next so that he would not have to face the \u201cburden\u201d of decision. At work, he found it easy to follow his boss\u2019s directions but had difficulty making even minor independent decisions. The situation was \u201cdepressing,\u201d he said, but nothing new.\n\nMr. Irvin also reported dissatisfaction with his relationships with women. He described a series of several-month-long relationships over the prior 10 years that ended despite his doing \u201ceverything I could\u201d and \u201cnever getting angry or yelling.\u201d His most recent relationship had been with an opera singer. He reported having gone to several operas and taken singing classes to impress her, even though he did not particularly enjoy music. That relationship had recently ended for unclear reasons. He said his mood and self-confidence were tied to his dating. Being single made him feel desperate, but desperation made it even harder to get a girlfriend. He said he felt trapped by that spiral. Since the latest breakup, he had been quite sad, with frequent crying spells. It was this depression that had prompted him to seek treatment. He denied all other symptoms of depression, including problems with sleep, appetite, energy, suicidality, and ability to enjoy things.\n\nMr. Irvin initially denied taking any medications, but he eventually revealed that 1 year earlier his primary care physician had begun to prescribe alprazolam 0.5 mg\/day for \u201canxiety.\u201d His dose had escalated, and at the time of the evaluation, Mr. Irvin was taking 5 mg\/day and getting prescriptions from three different physicians. Cutting back led to anxiety and \u201cthe shakes.\u201d\n\nMr. Irvin denied any prior personal or family psychiatric history, including outpatient psychiatric appointments.\n\nAfter hearing this history, the psychiatrist was concerned about Mr. Irvin\u2019s escalating alprazolam use and his chronic difficulties with independence. She thought the most accurate diagnosis was benzodiazepine use disorder comorbid with a personality disorder. However, she was concerned about the negative unintended effects that these diagnoses might have on the patient, including his employment and insurance coverage, as well as how he would be dealt with by future clinicians. She typed into the electronic medical record a diagnosis of \u201cadjustment disorder with depressed mood.\u201d Two weeks later, Mr. Irvin\u2019s insurance company asked her for his diagnosis, and she gave the same diagnosis.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, the user has provided a detailed clinical vignette and wants me to act as an expert psychiatrist diagnosing the patient based on DSM-5-TR criteria. I need to follow the rubric for data extraction and diagnostic reasoning at Level 5, but the response should only include the structured list of diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes, without any clinical reasoning.\n\nFirst, I'll extract key information from the vignette. The patient is a 31-year-old man with lifelong issues: lack of assertiveness, difficulty making decisions, dependency on others for direction, and a pattern of submissive behavior in relationships. He modifies his interests to please partners (like taking singing classes for his opera singer girlfriend), which suggests a pervasive pattern of needing others to assume responsibility for major areas of his life. This aligns with Dependent Personality Disorder.\n\nHe's also experiencing depressive symptoms following a breakup\u2014sadness, crying spells\u2014but denies other depressive features like sleep or appetite changes, suicidality, or anhedonia. The psychiatrist in the vignette considers Adjustment Disorder, but given the chronicity and pervasiveness of his interpersonal difficulties, that seems more secondary. The acute depressive episode appears reactive to the breakup, so Unspecified Depressive Disorder might fit since it doesn't meet full criteria for major depressive episode.\n\nThe alprazolam use is concerning: he's obtaining it from multiple doctors, has escalated to 5 mg\/day, and experiences withdrawal symptoms like anxiety and shakes when cutting back. This clearly indicates Benzodiazepine Use Disorder. The vignette also mentions anxiety, but it's tied to withdrawal, so an Anxiety Disorder due to another medical condition or substance\/medication-induced should be considered. However, since the anxiety emerges with reduction in alprazolam, it's likely part of the withdrawal syndrome rather than a primary anxiety disorder.\n\nFor the personality disorder, the chronic pattern of dependency and submissiveness is central. Avoidant Personality Disorder could be a differential due to his lack of self-confidence, but the vignette emphasizes his reliance on others rather than avoidance of social interaction due to fear of rejection. So Dependent Personality Disorder is more fitting.\n\nI need to prioritize the primary diagnosis. The most prominent and chronic issue is the personality pathology, but the substance use disorder is acute and severe. However, the vignette's psychiatrist noted concern about labeling him with a personality disorder, which might influence the primary diagnosis. But based on DSM-5-TR, the substance use disorder and personality disorder are both present. Since the substance use is iatrogenic to some extent (prescribed by a PCP), but the pattern of misuse is clear, Benzodiazepine Use Disorder should be primary. Then the personality disorder, followed by the depressive condition.\n\nOther differentials: Generalized Anxiety Disorder isn't supported because his anxiety is linked to withdrawal. Avoidant Personality Disorder is possible but less aligned with his active seeking of relationships despite submissiveness. I'll list Unspecified Anxiety Disorder as a possibility given the reported anxiety, but it's vague. The adjustment disorder diagnosis in the vignette seems inaccurate given the chronic issues, so I'll include it as a secondary consideration but not as the primary.\n\nNow, structuring the list: Primary diagnosis should be Benzodiazepine Use Disorder, then Dependent Personality Disorder, then Unspecified Depressive Disorder, then Unspecified Anxiety Disorder, and finally Adjustment Disorder as per the psychiatrist's documented diagnosis, though it's likely incorrect. I'll assign corresponding ICD-10 codes accordingly.",

Once the items were transported to Mr. Judd\u2019s apartment, Mr. Kleinman began to complain about Mr. Judd\u2019s \u201ccrazy rules\u201d about where items could be placed on the bookshelf, which direction the hangers in the closet faced, and whether their clothes could be intermingled. Moreover, Mr. Kleinman complained that there was hardly any space for his possessions because Mr. Judd never threw anything away. \u201cI\u2019m terrified of losing something important,\u201d added Mr. Judd.\n\nOver the ensuing weeks, arguments broke out nightly as they unpacked boxes and settled in. Making matters worse, Mr. Judd would often come home after 9:00 or 10:00 p.m., because he had a personal rule to always have a blank \u201cto-do\u201d list by the end of the day. Mr. Kleinman would often wake early in the morning to find Mr. Judd grimly organizing shelves or closets or cleaning the floor. Throughout this process, Mr. Judd appeared to be working hard at everything while enjoying himself less and getting less done. Mr. Kleinman found himself feeling increasingly detached from his boyfriend the longer they lived together.\n\nMr. Judd denied symptoms of depression and free-floating anxiety. He said that he had never experimented with cigarettes or alcohol, adding, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to feel like I was out of control.\u201d He denied a family history of mental illness. He was raised in a two-parent household and was an above-average high school and college student. He was an only child and first shared a room as a college freshman. He described that experience as being difficult due to \u201cconflicting styles\u2014he was a mess and I knew that things should be kept neat.\u201d He had moved mid-year into a single dorm room and had not lived with anyone until Mr. Kleinman moved in. Mr. Judd was well liked by his boss, earning recognition as \u201cemployee of the month\u201d three times in 2 years. Feedback from colleagues and subordinates was less enthusiastic, indicating that he was a micromanager on shared projects, and often critical of his colleagues\u2019 efforts. Also, it seemed he had a reputation as a bore, stemming from a happy hour trivia night in which he had repeatedly questioned the answers his coworkers provided.\n\nOn examination, Mr. Judd was a thin man with eyeglasses and gelled hair, sitting on a couch next to his boyfriend. He was meticulously dressed. He was cooperative with the interview and sat quietly while his boyfriend spoke, interrupting on a few occasions to contradict. His speech was normal in rate and tone. His affect was irritable. There was no evidence of depression. He denied specific phobias and did not think he had ever experienced a panic attack. At the end of the consultation, Mr. Judd remarked, \u201cI know I\u2019m difficult, but I really do want this to work out.\u201d",

Mr. Judd shows rigidity, perfectionism, preoccupation with order and rules, difficulty discarding items, and interpersonal problems due to these traits. He denies depression or anxiety but admits to being \"difficult.\" The traits are longstanding, affecting work and relationships.\n\nThe primary diagnosis seems clear: Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder. The vignette describes pervasive pattern of preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, control, and inflexibility, matching DSM-5-TR criteria. \n\nFor secondary diagnoses, I should consider other conditions that might explain some features. Hoarding disorder could fit the inability to discard items, but it's not the core issue. Adjustment disorder might capture the distress from moving in together. Generalized anxiety disorder is less likely since he denies anxiety, but the rigidity could be a manifestation. Other specified personality disorder could cover traits not fully meeting OCPD criteria.\n\nWait, the user said \"top 5 most likely\" so I need to prioritize based on clinical likelihood. OCPD is primary. Hoarding is secondary due to the \"terrified of losing something\" and never throwing things away. Adjustment disorder is plausible given the relationship conflict. The other two are less clear but possible differentials.\n\nLet me verify ICD-10 codes: OCPD is F60.5, hoarding is F42.3, adjustment disorder is F43.20, GAD is F41.1, other personality disorder is F60.89.

    "vignette":"Raven Lundquist (she\/her, preferring Raven) was a 24-year-old graduate student in philosophy who presented for a psychiatric evaluation at her brother\u2019s insistence. The two siblings lived together, and the brother threatened to withhold her allowance from a small trust if she didn\u2019t get \u201csome help.\u201d\n\nRaven explained that her brother was worried about her being \u201csadomasochistic.\u201d In public, he might just say that he was worried that she was an alcoholic and out of control, but she thought he just didn\u2019t like her interest in \u201cBDSM\u201d (bondage, domination\/discipline, sadism\/submission, and masochism).\n\nShe said that she had been in a relationship with Lilly for about a year. The two of them self-identified as queer, a label they found less stigmatizing than \u201clesbian.\u201d One evening, after an evening of drinking with her brother, Raven told him that she and Lilly enjoyed going to bondage parties, where they would role-play \u201cmistress-slave scenes\u201d in which they would wear tight leather clothing and high heels, and Lilly would whip Raven and call her derogatory or humiliating names. Raven was fine with being seen as a masochist in public, but in private, she generally enjoyed being in charge.\n\nRaven asked the psychiatrist whether he was \u201cthe kind of shrink who pathologizes everything? Surely, you\u2019re not like my brother, who gets squeamish about anything related to kink. But that\u2019s his problem, right doctor? Don\u2019t you agree that his concerns are just homophobia?\u201d She asked whether the psychiatrist had read Justine by the Marquis de Sade, \u201cwhich isn\u2019t as well written as Lolita, but it strikes a chord. By the way, Lilly laughs at my reading choices, calling me an \u2018old-school perv.\u2019\u2009\u201d\n\nOn questioning about other BDSM activities, Raven said she sometimes drugged Lilly without Lilly\u2019s knowledge. She found the sense of control to be extremely sexually exciting. Raven said she did not think Lilly would mind if she found out, given that Lilly identified as a sadomasochist and would often let Raven tie her up. Raven admitted that she had secretly drugged previous sexual partners, but that only one had complained about it, and \u201conly when she found photos on my camera.\u201d That lover had broken off the relationship immediately and claimed that she would have gone to the police if the \u201cphotos weren\u2019t so embarrassing.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about her brother\u2019s concern about her alcohol use, Raven immediately said she did \u201cno illegal drugs, no tobacco, not even weed.\u201d Upon further questioning, she did say she might have an alcohol problem. She said she often planned to have a single drink but generally ended up getting significantly intoxicated. She generally got along well with Lilly and her brother, but they often got into verbal fights after everyone had \u201cbecome really drunk.\u201d She said she often enjoyed her \u201cbinges,\u201d with the only problem being that she often missed early morning classes because of hangovers. She had no criminal history.\n\nRaven\u2019s childhood history was notable for having been abandoned by their mother while young. She and her brother had lived with relatives and in foster homes before they had been adopted by a woman whom she referred to as our \u201cintrusive but well-meaning pseudo-mother.\u201d That woman had died the year before, leaving behind a small trust fund for the two of them. Raven had memory gaps from her childhood and thought she might have been sexually molested. \u201cThe abuse narrative would make sense, wouldn\u2019t it? But I really don\u2019t remember.\u201d Raven\u2019s medical history was pertinent for having had scoliosis; as a child, she was treated with insertion of a Harrington rod and an extended hospitalization.\n\nRaven described sexual attraction to both men and women but preferred women because \u201cthey are typically more submissive.\u201d When she masturbated, and when she drugged sexual partners, she fantasized about \u201cpower and control,\u201d particularly about molesting unwilling partners.\n\nShe said she felt calm when in sexual control, and when intoxicated, but that she otherwise felt \u201cpretty anxious.\u201d Previous psychiatrists had diagnosed her with generalized anxiety disorder, for which she had been prescribed a benzodiazepine; these were also the medications she used to drug sexual partners.\n\nRaven said she sometimes felt down and depressed but did not think she had ever had a \u201cclinical depression.\u201d While often anxious, she denied ever having phobias or panic. She denied ever feeling suicidal but had sometimes thought about killing the drugged sexual partners, which, \u201cas you surely know, I would never actually do.\u201d She denied obsessions, compulsions, delusions, and hallucinations. She was intelligent and cognitively intact.",

    "vignette":"Terry Najarian, a 65-year-old salesman for a large corporation, presented for a psychiatric evaluation after his wife threatened to leave him. Although he said he was embarrassed to discuss his issues with a stranger, he described his sexual interest in women\u2019s undergarments in a quite matter-of-fact manner. This interest had surfaced several years earlier and had not been a problem until he was caught masturbating by his wife 6 weeks prior to the evaluation. Upon seeing him dressed in panties and a bra, she initially \u201cwent nuts,\u201d thinking he was having an affair. After he clarified that he was not seeing anyone else, she \u201cshut him out\u201d and hardly spoke to him. When they argued, she called him a \u201cpervert\u201d and made it clear that she was considering divorce unless he \u201cgot help.\u201d\n\nMr. Najarian\u2019s habit began in the setting of his wife\u2019s severe arthritis and likely depression, both of which significantly reduced her overall activity level and specifically her interest in sex. His \u201cfetish\u201d was the bright spot during his frequent and otherwise dreary business trips. He also masturbated at home but generally waited until his wife was out of the house. His specific pattern was to masturbate about twice weekly, using bras and panties that he had collected over several years. He said that intercourse with his wife had faded to \u201cevery month or two\u201d but was mutually satisfying.\n\nThe patient had been married for over 30 years, and the couple had two grown children. Mr. Najarian had planned to retire comfortably later that year, but not if the two choices were either \u201cto be poor after we split the assets or to sit around the house all day and be called a pervert.\u201d\n\nHe became visibly anxious when discussing his marital difficulties. He described some recent difficulty falling asleep and \u201cworried constantly\u201d about his marriage but denied other psychiatric problems. He had made a show of throwing away a half dozen pieces of underwear, which had seemed to reassure his wife, but he had saved his \u201cfavorites\u201d and \u201ccould always buy more.\u201d He said he was of mixed mind. He did not want to end his marriage, but he saw nothing harmful in his new mode of masturbating. \u201cI\u2019m not unfaithful or doing anything bad,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just excites me, and my wife certainly doesn\u2019t want to be having sex a few times a week.\u201d\n\nMr. Najarian denied any difficulties related to sexual functioning, adding that he could maintain erections and achieve orgasm without women\u2019s undergarments. He recalled being aroused when he touched women\u2019s underwear as a teenager and had masturbated repeatedly to that experience. That fantasy had disappeared when he became sexually active with his wife. He denied any personal or family history of mental illness.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, the user wants me to explain the thought process behind diagnosing Terry Najarian based on the given vignette and rubric. Let me start by breaking down the requirements.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the rubric's two subcompetencies: Data Extraction and Organization, and Diagnostic Reasoning. The response must perform at Level 5 for both, meaning extracting subtle cues and constructing a nuanced differential. The answer provided lists five diagnoses with ICD-10 codes, so the thinking should reflect how those were prioritized.\n\nLooking at the vignette, Terry is a 65-year-old man with a paraphilic interest in women's undergarments. The key points are his recurrent arousal pattern, the distress from marital conflict, and his lack of personal distress about the behavior itself. His wife's reaction is a major stressor, leading to anxiety and sleep issues.\n\nFor Data Extraction, I need to identify all relevant details. His habit started years ago, linked to his wife's decreased sexual interest. He masturbates using underwear, which causes marital problems but no dysfunction in his sexual performance. He's anxious about the marriage but not about the fetish. He had early arousal to underwear as a teen, which resurfaced later. No other psych history.\n\nIn Diagnostic Reasoning, the primary diagnosis should be Fetishistic Disorder. But here's the nuance: according to DSM-5-TR, the fetish must cause clinically significant distress or impairment. Terry isn't distressed by the behavior itself, but the marital conflict causes distress. That might qualify as impairment in social functioning. However, if the distress is solely due to others' reactions, it might not meet the criteria. The response lists F65.0, so it's considering the marital issue as significant impairment.\n\nNext, Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety makes sense because his anxiety and sleep issues are tied to the marital stressor, appearing within 6 weeks of the incident. That's a clear temporal link.\n\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder is listed as secondary. He worries constantly and has sleep issues, but the worry is focused on the marriage, not multiple areas. So maybe it's less likely, but included because anxiety symptoms are present.\n\nUnspecified Depressive Disorder could be considered if his wife's depression is affecting him, but he denies depression. However, the vignette mentions his wife's likely depression, not his. So that might be a stretch, but perhaps included due to the context of marital strain.\n\nOther Specified Paraphilic Disorder is there as an alternative if Fetishistic Disorder isn't fully met, maybe because the distress isn't from the fetish itself. That shows nuanced thinking, considering diagnostic flexibility.\n\nAlso, the response avoids non-psychiatric diagnoses and sticks to F-codes. Each choice links back to specific cues in the vignette, like the duration, triggers, and associated features. The prioritization seems based on the immediacy of the presenting problem (marital conflict) and the core paraphilia, followed by comorbid anxiety conditions.",

    "vignette":"Vance Orren was a 28-year-old self-reported cisgender heterosexual man who was arrested after pushing a stranger in front of an oncoming subway train. He told police that he believed the man was going to \u201ctell everyone that I was a faggot\u201d and that he, Mr. Orren, was trying to protect himself from the \u201chomosexual conspiracy.\u201d\n\nMr. Orren had a history of a psychotic disorder, a cocaine use disorder, and nonadherence to medication and psychotherapy at the time of the incident. He was unemployed. In court, Mr. Orren entered a plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease (the \u201cinsanity defense\u201d) and underwent a full psychiatric evaluation, including assessment of his sexual history and desires.\n\nAs part of his legal case, Mr. Orren underwent a structured sex offender evaluation. He reported that his first sexual contact was at age 12, when his uncle and an 18-year-old male cousin \u201cdid things\u201d to him while he was in foster care. They would take him to McDonald\u2019s afterward, \u201cso it was fine.\u201d By the time he was 14 or 15, he was regularly having sex with males and females who ranged in age \u201cfrom about ten to in their thirties.\u201d\n\nHe was unable to answer whether the sexual contact was always consensual, saying, \u201cNo one ever called the cops.\u201d As an adult, he said that he preferred having sex with \u201cyoung girls, because they don\u2019t fight much.\u201d He said that he usually only had sex with adults when he hired prostitutes or prostituted himself in exchange for money or drugs, although he said that sometimes when high, he \u201cmight have done stuff that I don\u2019t really remember.\u201d\n\nThe structured sex offender evaluation included penile plethysmography, assessment of visual reaction time using Viewing Time (a measure of the amount of time a person looks at a particular photo or other visual representation of a sexually stimulating situation), and a detailed interview about his sexual practices. This evaluation concluded that his main sexual attraction was to girls between the ages of 8 and 13 years.\n\nMr. Orren\u2019s personal history was significant for multiple childhood disruptions that led to his moving into the foster care system at age 7. At age 9, his first foster mother caught him repeatedly stealing toys and bullying other children. When she reprimanded him, he hit her with a brick, knocking her unconscious. That led to placement in a second foster home. He began using drugs and alcohol at age 11. He was first incarcerated at 13, for shoplifting from an electronics store in order to obtain money for marijuana. At that point, he went back to live with his maternal grandmother, who has episodically provided him a home since then. During those 15 years, he has been arrested at least a dozen times, mostly for drug possession.\n\nMr. Orren stopped attending school in eighth grade, at about the same time that he was admitted to his first psychiatric inpatient unit. That admission was triggered by his beating his head against a wall \u201cto stop the voices.\u201d He was given a DSM-IV diagnosis of psychosis not otherwise specified, treated with risperidone, and discharged after 1 week. Soon after discharge, he discontinued the antipsychotic medication.\n\nBetween the ages of 15 and 28, Mr. Orren regularly abused cocaine and alcohol and often used other substances when they were available. By the time of his arrest, he had had at least seven psychiatric admissions, always for auditory hallucinations and persecutory delusions (usually of a sexual nature). It was not clear which substances he was using prior to and during these episodes of psychosis or whether they were implicated in the development of his psychiatric symptoms. He had also been admitted twice for alcohol detoxification after he went into withdrawal while unable to acquire alcohol. He was consistently nonadherent to any type of outpatient treatment. He maintained sobriety only while in hospitals or jails. When contacted by the consulting psychiatrist, his grandmother pointed out that Mr. Orren had always been \u201creckless, dishonest, and angry. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard him apologize. I love him, but he probably belongs in jail for lots of reasons.\u201d",

The user is an expert psychiatrist, so the response needs to reflect high-level clinical reasoning while strictly adhering to the DSM-5-TR criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to extract and organize the data effectively. The vignette presents a complex case with multiple layers: violent behavior, psychotic symptoms, substance use, and paraphilic interests. I should identify key symptoms and contextual details like timeline, triggers, and risk factors. \n\nLooking at the history, there's early onset of behavioral issues, childhood trauma, and persistent substance abuse. The psychotic features include auditory hallucinations and persecutory delusions, especially around sexual themes. The sexual offender evaluation points toward pedophilic attraction. Also, there's a pattern of antisocial behavior from childhood, which is crucial for differential diagnosis.\n\nFor diagnostic reasoning, I need to consider primary and secondary diagnoses. Schizophrenia seems primary due to chronic psychosis despite periods of sobriety. Substance-induced disorders are tricky here because psychosis persists without substances, but cocaine use disorder is clearly present. Pedophilic disorder is supported by the structured evaluation. Antisocial personality disorder fits given the lifelong pattern of conduct issues and lack of remorse. PTSD is less clear but possible due to childhood sexual trauma, though the vignette doesn't emphasize trauma symptoms.\n\nPrioritizing diagnoses: Schizophrenia is top because psychosis is central and predates substance use in some instances. Cocaine use disorder is next due to documented abuse and impact. Pedophilic disorder is specific from the evaluation. Antisocial PD is evident from behavior history. PTSD is included as a consideration given the trauma, though it might be secondary.\n\nI must ensure each diagnosis has a corresponding ICD-10 F-code and avoid non-psychiatric conditions.

Leroy reports he was recently recommended by his present physician to see a psychiatrist again, given how distressing his intrusive thoughts have become. His previous psychiatrist started him on Zoloft, and gave him recommendation for community based mental health psychotherapist.  Leroy has been taking the Zoloft (200 mg daily) for about 5 years, for what he states his provider thought was \u201canxiety or depression.\u201d Leroy acknowledges history of periods of \u201csadness\u201d, stating \u201cyeah sad, sometimes, but not depressed; when things get out of control; its been a while though; when something feels out of reach.\u201d Denied present or past suicidal ideation, and denied problems with active thoughts, plans or intents of harm to self or others. Leroy insists no problems with perceptual distortion or paranoia, and denied thought insertion or thought broadcasting.  Leroy stated that the intrusive thoughts, \u201cfirst started happening when I was a kid, I was able to cope with them; getting better understanding what they were; ways to get them to go away; calm myself down and regain control and go on with my life; now that is not working.\u201d Leroy states the most recent intrusive thought has been a fear that the chart bus he drives from his local airport to downtown stop will \u201cslide off the road because of ice or snow.\u201d He thinks about this, on average, about 30 to 45 minutes a day.  Leroy endorsed episodes of \u201cpanic\u201d and \u201cmy body almost feels like its paralyzed; I experience pain from my spine up\u201d, which lasts for a couple of days at a time. With regards to \u201cgeneralized anxiety\u201d, patient reports \u201cI would have these thoughts about my ailing mother; she has schizophrenia; my body would react to whatever I was thinking about her; my body tenses up when that happens.\u201d Leroy denied any preoccupations about his physical health, nor inability to leave the home because of anxiety. He reports to work regularly, and rarely misses any work unless he is very sick. He says he is never late to work or planned appointments. Leroy has a girlfriend, and says that relationship is going \u201cgreat.\u201d In his spare time, he continues to join his friends for basketball pickup games and video game nights, which he still enjoys.

Leroy acknowledges observed violence\/abuse of his parents when growing up, and with harsh parenting to his 3 siblings, patient denied problems with flashbacks, nightmares or hypervigilance associated with the trauma.

Leroy's primary complaint is intrusive thoughts since childhood, worsening recently. He's on Zoloft 200mg for anxiety\/depression but denies current depression. The intrusive thought about the bus sliding off the road occupies 30-45 minutes daily.

Let me extract and organize the key information systematically.\n\nThe patient is a 22-year-old male with multiple sclerosis and a history of traumatic brain injury from an assault 4 years ago. Following the assault, he developed heavy alcohol use (8+ drinks daily) leading to functional impairment, relationship loss, and legal issues. He has been sober for 76 days. Notably, he describes a distinct episode 2 years ago characterized by 2-week insomnia, irritability, excessive energy, impulsive behaviors (sudden trips, business ventures, sexual indiscretions), and grandiose delusions about curing autism. This episode occurred during an MS flare and hasn't recurred. He denies current mood symptoms, psychosis, anxiety, or trauma history beyond losses.\n\nFor diagnostic reasoning, the clear manic episode with psychotic features lasting 2 weeks is most striking - it meets criteria for a bipolar disorder despite occurring in the context of MS. The alcohol use disorder is well-documented with severe features. The traumatic brain injury and MS are relevant medical contexts. Adjustment disorder should be considered given multiple losses, though current symptoms aren't emphasized. The grandiose delusions during the manic episode warrant separate psychotic disorder notation.\n\nThe primary diagnosis must capture the full manic episode with psychotic features.

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the vignette. The patient is a 63-year-old woman named Elain who presents with a chief complaint of hallucinating. She witnessed a traumatic event 27 days ago where a pedestrian was hit and died despite her efforts to help. Since then, she's been experiencing dread, anxiety, hypervigilance (jumping at skidding car sounds), intrusive images of the event, nightmares, and avoidance of driving.\n\nWait, she mentions \"hallucinating\" but then denies actual visual or auditory hallucinations. Instead, she describes an out-of-body experience where she felt detached and saw herself from above. That sounds more like depersonalization or derealization. The timeline is clear\u2014symptoms started right after the trauma, which is recent but lasting almost a month.\n\nConsidering the DSM-5-TR criteria, the key features here are exposure to a traumatic event (witnessing death), intrusive symptoms (images, nightmares), avoidance (driving), negative alterations in cognition\/mood (persistent fear, horror), and arousal (hypervigilance, exaggerated startle). The duration is 27 days, which is more than a month for Acute Stress Disorder but less than for PTSD. Oh right, Acute Stress Disorder requires symptoms for 3 days to 1 month, so 27 days fits. PTSD would require symptoms for more than a month.\n\nShe also reports derealization (feeling detached, out-of-body experience), which is a dissociative symptom common in both ASD and PTSD. No history of mania or depression, so mood disorders might be less likely. The depersonalization could point to Depersonalization\/Derealization Disorder, but that usually requires persistent symptoms without another disorder explaining it better. Here, it's clearly tied to the trauma.\n\nDifferential diagnoses should include trauma-related disorders first. Then maybe adjustment disorder if the symptoms were less severe, but here the trauma is extreme and symptoms match ASD closely. Anxiety disorders like Generalized Anxiety Disorder could be considered, but the direct link to trauma makes trauma disorders more likely. Also, she denies actual hallucinations, so psychotic disorders aren't fitting. The out-of-body experience isn't a hallucination but dissociation.\n\nSo primary diagnosis: Acute Stress Disorder, given the timeline and symptom cluster. Secondary could be PTSD provisional if symptoms persist, but currently it's within the acute phase. Other secondaries: Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder if there's any nuance, Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety, Depersonalization\/Derealization Disorder, and maybe Unspecified Anxiety Disorder as a broader category.

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the clinical vignette provided. The patient is a 19-year-old male who reports believing someone has poisoned him at home. He mentions symptoms starting about two and a half months ago after losing his job. He experiences increased sleepiness, low energy, low motivation, and concentration problems. He describes paranoid delusions, including hearing his parents whispering through vents about killing him and replacing him, even when they're not physically present. He also believes video game characters are his parents pretending to be other people. He has stopped eating dinner, withdrawn socially, and shows paranoid behaviors like keeping shades drawn. During the exam, he becomes suspicious and abruptly leaves.\n\nFirst, I need to extract all relevant symptoms and organize them logically. Key symptoms include: paranoid delusions (poisoning, parents plotting to kill him), auditory hallucinations (hearing whispers), referential delusions (video game characters being his parents), social withdrawal, changes in sleep patterns (hypersomnia), low energy, anhedonia or low motivation, and concentration issues. The timeline is acute, starting after a stressor (job loss), with no prior similar episodes, no substance use, and no head injury.\n\nNext, considering differential diagnoses. The prominent psychotic symptoms (delusions, hallucinations) suggest a primary psychotic disorder. Given the duration (over two months) and functional impairment, schizophrenia is a strong candidate. However, the onset is relatively recent, so schizophreniaform disorder is also possible. The presence of mood symptoms like low energy and motivation raises the possibility of a depressive episode with psychotic features, but the psychotic symptoms seem primary and mood symptoms secondary. Substance-induced psychosis is ruled out by negative toxicology. No medical causes mentioned, so delirium or psychotic disorder due to another medical condition is less likely. Brief psychotic disorder is possible but duration exceeds one month.\n\nThe patient's age (19) is typical for onset of schizophrenia. The paranoid type fits given the delusions and hallucinations. Schizoaffective disorder could be considered if mood symptoms were more prominent, but here they seem secondary. Delusional disorder might apply if hallucinations were absent, but auditory hallucinations are present, ruling it out. PTSD or acute stress disorder isn't indicated as no trauma is mentioned. Anxiety disorders don't align with the psychotic features.\n\nOrganizing the data: The core symptoms are psychotic (delusions, hallucinations), negative symptoms (withdrawal, avolition), and some mood-related issues (low energy). The absence of substance use or medical issues points toward a primary psychotic disorder. The acute onset after a stressor but persistence beyond that suggests schizophrenia rather than brief psychotic disorder.\n\nNow, prioritizing diagnoses. Schizophrenia is the most likely given duration, symptoms, and impairment. Schizophreniaform disorder is secondary as it's similar but shorter duration. Major depressive disorder with psychotic features is possible but psychotic symptoms dominate. Delusional disorder is less likely due to hallucinations. Substance-induced psychosis is ruled out. Therefore, the primary diagnosis is schizophrenia, paranoid type. Secondary diagnoses include schizophreniaform disorder, major depressive disorder with psychotic features, delusional disorder, and brief psychotic disorder (though duration may exceed one month, so it's lower on the list).\n\nFinally, ensure ICD-10 codes are accurate. Schizophrenia is F20.9, schizophreniaform disorder is F20.81, major depressive disorder with psychotic features is F32.3, delusional disorder is F22, and brief psychotic disorder is F23. The response should list these in order of likelihood without additional reasoning.",

She's a 54-year-old Navy Veteran coming to the ER with sensations of bugs crawling on her, which started 36 hours after an elective surgery. She's also experiencing thirst and shaking. She drinks 4-5 beers daily and has been using Klonopin for 15 years, but her PCP stopped prescribing it a year ago, so she buys it online. She sometimes combines beer and Klonopin in the morning to manage shakes.\n\nLooking at her history, she's been to multiple ERs with urine tox positive for alcohol, benzodiazepines, opiates, and amphetamines, but she's never been prescribed the latter two. She admits to trying to cut back on alcohol because others have expressed concern, but she's drinking more to achieve the same effect. Labs show severely low sodium and potassium. She denies hallucinations or depressed mood.\n\nFirst, I need to extract key symptoms and organize them logically. The main issues are tactile hallucinations (bugs crawling), shaking, thirst, polysubstance use, tolerance to alcohol, and electrolyte imbalances. The timeline is important\u2014symptoms started post-surgery during bed rest, which might indicate withdrawal or another acute condition.\n\nConsidering diagnostic criteria, the tactile hallucinations and shaking could point to withdrawal syndromes. Alcohol withdrawal can cause hallucinations, but she's still drinking, so maybe it's benzodiazepine withdrawal since her Klonopin source might be inconsistent. The low sodium and potassium could be due to chronic alcohol use or other factors.\n\nNow, building a differential diagnosis. The primary issue seems to be substance-related. She has alcohol use disorder, evidenced by increased consumption to achieve effect, inability to cut down, and social impacts. Benzodiazepine use disorder is also present due to obtaining it illicitly and using it to manage withdrawal symptoms.\n\nThe acute presentation with hallucinations and shaking could be substance withdrawal, specifically alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal. However, she's still consuming both, so maybe it's a mixed withdrawal or another condition like delirium due to electrolyte imbalances.\n\nOther substances like opiates and amphetamines are in her tox screen, but she denies prescription, suggesting possible polysubstance use disorder. The electrolyte imbalances could lead to delirium, but she denies other hallucinations or cognitive issues mentioned.\n\nConsidering all this, the primary diagnosis should address the most acute and severe symptoms. Substance withdrawal seems likely, but which substance? Given the timing post-surgery and bed rest, maybe she reduced her intake unintentionally, leading to withdrawal. Benzodiazepine withdrawal can cause tactile hallucinations and shakes, similar to alcohol withdrawal.\n\nShe also has a history of losing friends and staying home, which might indicate a depressive disorder, but she denies depressed mood. However, substance use could be masking underlying issues. But since she denies it, I'll focus on the substance-related diagnoses and acute withdrawal.\n\nPossible diagnoses: Alcohol withdrawal with perceptual disturbances, benzodiazepine withdrawal, polysubstance use disorder, alcohol use disorder, sedative-hypnotic use disorder. Electrolyte imbalances could be due to chronic alcohol use or other medical issues, but that's not a psychiatric diagnosis.\n\nStructuring the list: Primary should be the most acute issue requiring immediate attention\u2014likely alcohol withdrawal with hallucinations. Then, secondary diagnoses include the substance use disorders and any other related conditions.\n\nICD-10 codes: Alcohol withdrawal with perceptual disturbance is F10.231. Alcohol use disorder, moderate to severe, would be F10.20. Sedative-hypnotic use disorder (for benzodiazepines) is F13.20. Polysubstance use disorder might be F19.20. Another possibility is unspecified substance withdrawal if it's mixed, but alcohol seems prominent.\n\nGiven the labs, there might be medical complications, but those aren't psychiatric diagnoses.

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, the user wants me to outline the thought process behind the assistant's response to the clinical vignette about Collin. Let me start by breaking down the query and the assistant's answer.\n\nFirst, the user provides a detailed rubric for clinical reasoning, emphasizing data extraction and diagnostic reasoning. The assistant's response lists five diagnoses with ICD-10 codes. I need to reconstruct how the assistant arrived at each diagnosis based on the vignette.\n\nLooking at the primary diagnosis: Major Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (Alcohol-Induced Major Neurocognitive Disorder, Amnestic-Confabulatory Type). The vignette mentions a long history of alcohol use disorder, with complications like liver failure and gait abnormalities. The cognitive issues\u2014wandering, memory loss, disorientation in familiar places, confabulation\u2014align with alcohol-induced dementia. The absence of acute findings on CT and the timeline support this as a chronic condition.\n\nNext, Major Depressive Disorder. Collin reports depressed mood, anhedonia, low motivation, and passive suicidal thoughts for two years. These meet criteria for MDD, and it's common in the context of neurocognitive disorders. \n\nAlcohol Use Disorder, in sustained remission, is mentioned due to his history, but he's been sober for six years. That's a key point for remission status.\n\nUnspecified Neurocognitive Disorder is listed, possibly considering other etiologies despite alcohol being likely. Since the CT didn't show strokes, but vascular causes can't be ruled out entirely, it's a secondary consideration.\n\nDisruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder seems off since it's for children\/adolescents. Maybe the assistant considered Irritable Mood related to the neurocognitive disorder instead, but DMDD wouldn't fit an adult. Perhaps a better alternative would be Unspecified Depressive Disorder or adjustment issues, but given the criteria, MDD fits better.\n\nThe assistant probably prioritized conditions based on chronicity, symptom severity, and history. Alcohol-induced cognitive decline is prominent, depression comorbid, and other neurocognitive disorders to rule out.

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, the user has provided a detailed clinical vignette and asked for a structured diagnosis list based on DSM-5-TR. Let me start by extracting and organizing the relevant information.\n\nFirst, the patient reports auditory hallucinations with negative commentary and thought insertion, which started two weeks ago. These symptoms align with psychotic features. The patient also mentions a history of alcohol use disorder with recent increased drinking, last drink five days ago, and past withdrawal symptoms like seizures and vomiting. This suggests possible alcohol withdrawal or substance-induced psychosis.\n\nNext, there's a history of depression with anhedonia, withdrawal, low motivation, and other symptoms over the past three weeks. Plus, trauma-related symptoms like flashbacks, nightmares, and hypervigilance indicate PTSD. The patient also mentions a past manic episode two years ago with decreased sleep, elevated energy, racing thoughts, and pressured speech, leading to hospitalization. That points to a bipolar disorder diagnosis.\n\nNow, for the differential diagnosis. The primary issue seems to be the psychotic symptoms. Given the timeline and alcohol use, Alcohol-Induced Psychotic Disorder is a strong candidate because the hallucinations started two weeks ago during a period of increased drinking and withdrawal. Schizophreniaform Disorder is also possible due to the psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month, but the substance use complicates this. \n\nThe patient's history of depression and past manic episode suggests Bipolar I Disorder, with the current episode being depressive with psychotic features. PTSD is clear from trauma history and symptoms. Alcohol Use Disorder is evident from the long-term heavy drinking and recent attempts to cut back.\n\nI need to ensure the diagnoses are ordered by likelihood. Alcohol-Induced Psychotic Disorder is primary because the psychosis is temporally related to alcohol use and withdrawal. Bipolar I Disorder is next due to the clear manic episode history. PTSD follows given the trauma symptoms. Schizophreniaform Disorder is less likely but included as the psychotic symptoms are recent. Alcohol Use Disorder is listed last as it's a chronic condition contributing to the current presentation.\n\nEach diagnosis needs an ICD-10 F-code. Let me verify the codes: F10.959 for Alcohol-Induced Psychotic Disorder, F31.9 for Bipolar I Disorder, F43.10 for PTSD, F20.81 for Schizophreniaform Disorder, and F10.20 for Alcohol Use Disorder. \n\nMake sure not to include any reasoning in the final output, just the structured list.

The user wants a structured list of diagnoses with ICD-10 codes, specifically the primary and four secondary diagnoses. The rubric emphasizes sophisticated data extraction and diagnostic reasoning, so I need to ensure my thought process aligns with Level 5 expertise.\n\nFirst, reviewing the vignette: Erin is 16, physically active (3 hours gym daily, lacrosse, ballet), restricts food intake (<1000 calories\/day), skips meals, engages in excessive exercise, uses laxatives, has amenorrhea (3 missed periods), and reports reflux and constipation. She denies mood symptoms or anxiety. \n\nFor data extraction, key patterns emerge: restrictive eating, weight loss behaviors (exercise, laxatives), amenorrhea, and preoccupation with food\/calories. The absence of depressed mood or body image distortion is noted but doesn\u2019t rule out eating disorders. The laxative use and reflux suggest potential gastrointestinal complications. \n\nFor diagnostic reasoning, anorexia nervosa (restricting type) fits best: caloric restriction, excessive exercise, amenorrhea, and likely low weight (implied by behaviors). But since low weight isn\u2019t explicitly stated, atypical anorexia could be considered. Bulimia nervosa is less likely due to absence of binge episodes. Avoidant\/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) might fit but lacks fear of weight gain. The laxative misuse and reflux hint at possible gastrointestinal issues or other comorbidities. \n\nDifferential diagnosis: Primary is anorexia nervosa. Secondary could include other specified feeding\/eating disorder (OSFED) if full criteria aren\u2019t met, laxative misuse disorder, and somatic symptoms related to reflux\/constipation.

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, the user provided a clinical case vignette and asked for a structured list of the top 5 most likely DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes. I need to base this only on the information given, without adding any extra details.\n\nFirst, let's extract key information from the vignette. Amber is 37, presents with suicidal ideation and frequent ER visits. She has a long history of self-harm (cutting since age 13), extensive trauma including sexual abuse and intimate partner violence. She reports constant flashbacks, nightmares, hypervigilance, and avoidance behaviors. The trigger for the current crisis is a breakup, leading to feelings of being \"pissed off.\" She denies changes in appetite, energy, or anhedonia, and also denies mania, psychosis, or substance abuse. She mentions lacking family support.\n\nNow, considering DSM-5-TR criteria, the primary diagnosis likely involves trauma and stressor-related disorders. The constant flashbacks, nightmares, hypervigilance, and avoidance strongly point to Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The history of multiple traumas across different life stages supports this.\n\nNext, the frequent suicidal ideation, self-harm behaviors, intense interpersonal conflicts, and fear of abandonment suggest Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). The pattern of unstable relationships, identity issues (implied by being \"too much to handle\"), and recurrent suicidal behaviors align with BPD criteria.\n\nThe patient's chronic suicidal thoughts and self-harm might also indicate a persistent depressive disorder or other specified depressive disorder, given the ongoing distress without full criteria for major depression. She denies appetite or energy changes, so Major Depressive Disorder might not fit, but the chronicity suggests a depressive condition.\n\nAdjustment Disorder with depressed mood could be considered due to the acute reaction to the breakup, but given the chronic trauma history, PTSD takes precedence. However, since the breakup triggered the current crisis, it's worth including as a secondary diagnosis.\n\nAnother consideration is Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder if there are mixed features, but PTSD seems well-supported. Also, Rule out Other Personality Disorders like Histrionic or Dependent, but BPD is most fitting.\n\nFinally, ensuring the ICD-10 codes are accurate. PTSD is F43.10, BPD is F60.3, Other Specified Depressive Disorder is F32.8, Adjustment Disorder is F43.21, and Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder is F43.8. \n\nNeed to list primary first, then four secondary diagnoses.

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the clinical case vignette about Evan. He's a 62-year-old Harvard professor with a history of heavy alcohol use but has been sober for about 7 months after outpatient rehab. He presented to the ER after taking ten 1 mg Klonopin at once, saying he just wanted to sleep, not to kill himself. He regrets it and denies suicidal intent.\n\nThere's recent discord with his wife, fear of her leaving, and after an argument two days ago, he relapsed with alcohol, drinking about six drinks each day since. He was intoxicated during the overdose. He mentions feeling a lack of purpose because Harvard has reduced his teaching duties. He denies active suicidal or homicidal thoughts, mania, psychosis, trauma, OCD, or panic.\n\nHe reports increased sleep (up to 14 hours), still feeling tired, unintentional weight loss (10 pounds in a month), difficulty concentrating, anhedonia (wants to enjoy things again), and unexplained crying. However, he denies hopelessness or despair.\n\nHe had a fall at home, leading to the ER visit, with left peri-orbital ecchymosis and forehead abrasions. Initial CT showed a 2-3 mm subdural hematoma, and a follow-up CT showed it increased to 5-7 mm, but he denies headaches, vision changes, confusion, or weakness. He's been on Cymbalta for depression for over five years without side effects.\n\nNow, I need to extract and organize the key information. Let me list the relevant details:\n\n- Demographic: 62-year-old white male, professor.\n- Substance use: History of heavy alcohol use, sober 7 months after rehab, recent relapse (6 drinks\/day for 2 days), intoxicated at overdose.\n- Overdose: Ten 1 mg Klonopin, stated intention to sleep, denies suicide attempt, regrets it.\n- Psychosocial stressors: Marital discord, fear of wife leaving, reduced professional duties leading to lack of purpose.\n- Mood symptoms: Increased sleep (hypersomnia), fatigue, unintentional weight loss, difficulty concentrating, anhedonia, unexplained crying. No hopelessness\/despair.\n- Exclusions: Denies suicidal\/homicidal thoughts, mania, psychosis, trauma, OCD, panic.\n- Medical: Fall at home, subdural hematoma (increasing size), no neurological symptoms.\n- Treatment: On Cymbalta for depression >5 years.\n\nOrganizing this, the main issues are mood symptoms, substance use, overdose event, psychosocial stressors, and a medical condition (subdural hematoma). The mood symptoms (sleep increase, weight loss, concentration issues, anhedonia, crying) suggest a depressive episode, but he's already on an antidepressant. The substance use includes both alcohol and benzodiazepines (Klonopin). The overdose, though denied as suicidal, could be intentional or due to impulsivity from intoxication or distress.\n\nMoving to diagnostic reasoning. Primary diagnosis: The mood symptoms align with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). He has depressed mood (lack of purpose, crying), anhedonia, significant weight loss, hypersomnia, fatigue, concentration issues. However, he's on Cymbalta, which might indicate treatment-resistant or breakthrough depression. Given the recent stressors (marital, professional), this could be a recurrent episode. So, F33.1 (Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, moderate) or F33.2 (severe) depending on symptom severity.\n\nBut wait, he denies hopelessness and despair, which are common in MDD, but the other symptoms are strong. Also, the overdose could be a suicide attempt despite his denial, which might indicate severity. However, he explicitly denies intent, so it's ambiguous.\n\nSecondary diagnoses: Substance Use Disorders. He has a history of heavy alcohol use, recent relapse after 7 months sober. That suggests Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), likely moderate to severe. Code F10.20 (Alcohol Use Disorder, moderate) or F10.21 (severe) depending on the history. Since he was in rehab, probably severe.\n\nAlso, Klonopin (clonazepam) is a benzodiazepine. Taking ten tablets at once, especially without prescription (not mentioned if prescribed), could indicate Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder. However, the vignette doesn't specify long-term misuse, just this overdose. But given his history with alcohol, polysubstance use is possible. So, consider F13.20 (Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder, uncomplicated) if there's a pattern, but the case only mentions this incident. Maybe it's not a use disorder, but rather intoxication or overdose. However, since he took a large amount, it could be misuse. But DSM-5 requires a pattern of use leading to impairment. Here, it's a single event, so maybe not a use disorder. Instead, consider F13.10 (Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Intoxication) if he was intoxicated, but he took them to sleep, not necessarily for intoxication. Alternatively, it could be poisoning, but that's not an F-code.\n\nPerhaps Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood due to the stressors (marital, professional). Code F43.21. Given the depressive symptoms, this might be a possibility, but the symptoms seem more severe and pervasive, leaning towards MDD.\n\nAnother consideration is Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) if the depression is chronic, but he's on Cymbalta for over five years, which could be for MDD or dysthymia. However, the current symptoms might represent a major depressive episode on top of dysthymia (double depression), but not specified.\n\nAlso, the subdural hematoma could contribute to neurocognitive issues, but he has no neurological symptoms. However, it might be a medication side effect or related to the fall. But in psychiatry, we might consider Neurocognitive Disorder due to Traumatic Brain Injury (if the fall caused it), but he denies confusion or cognitive changes other than concentration issues from depression. So, probably not primary.\n\nAdditionally, the overdose could be classified as a Suicide Attempt or Self-Harm, but he denies intent. In DSM-5, Suicidal Behavior Disorder is a condition for further study, not an official diagnosis. So, if not suicidal, it might be Other Specified Self-Harm (F68.8) or related to substance use.\n\nGiven the complexity, let's list the top five likely diagnoses with ICD-10 codes.\n\nPrimary: Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, moderate or severe. Since he's on medication and still symptomatic, possibly treatment-resistant. Code F33.2 (recurrent, severe without psychotic features) if the symptoms are severe, but he denies hopelessness, so maybe moderate. Let's go with F33.1 (recurrent, moderate).\n\nSecondary: Alcohol Use Disorder, severe, in early remission but with recent relapse. The recent relapse after 7 months sober might indicate early remission, but since he drank recently, it's active. Code F10.20 (Alcohol Use Disorder, moderate) or F10.21 (severe). Given multi-decade heavy use and rehab, likely severe. So, F10.21.\n\nThird: Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder, unspecified. He misused Klonopin, which could indicate a use disorder, but we don't have a pattern. However, taking a large amount impulsively might suggest misuse. Since it's a single event, maybe not, but given his substance history, it's plausible. Code F13.20 (uncomplicated) or F13.10 (intoxication). But for a use disorder, we need more criteria. Perhaps it's Other Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic-Related Disorder, but that's not standard. Alternatively, Poisoning by benzodiazepines, but not an F-code. So, I'll include F13.20 as a possibility.\n\nFourth: Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood. Given the stressors (marital discord, reduced professional duties), and the depressive symptoms, this could be primary. But the symptoms seem to meet MDD criteria, so Adjustment Disorder is less likely if MDD is present. However, if the depressive episode is directly related to stressors, it might be Adjustment Disorder. But the severity and symptoms suggest MDD. So, maybe as a secondary diagnosis. Code F43.21.\n\nFifth: Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder, if the overdose is related to stress but not quite Adjustment Disorder. Or maybe Unspecified Depressive Disorder if not meeting full criteria. But he seems to meet MDD criteria.\n\nAlso, consider Benzodiazepine Intoxication at the time of overdose. Code F13.129 (Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Intoxication, unspecified). Since he was intoxicated when he took the overdose, and he drank alcohol, so possible polysubstance intoxication.\n\nBut the instructions say top five diagnoses with F-codes, so I need to choose the most likely.\n\nLet's prioritize:\n\n1. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, severe without psychotic features (F33.2) \u2013 given the symptom severity (weight loss, hypersomnia, concentration issues, anhedonia, crying), and functional impairment.\n\n2. Alcohol Use Disorder, severe (F10.21) \u2013 history of heavy use, rehab, recent relapse.\n\n3. Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder, moderate (F13.20) \u2013 misuse of Klonopin, though pattern not detailed, but given alcohol use disorder, likely comorbid.\n\n4. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood (F43.21) \u2013 as a reaction to stressors, but since MDD is present, this might be secondary or comorbid.\n\n5. Other Specified Depressive Disorder (F32.89) \u2013 if the depressive symptoms don't fully meet MDD criteria, but they seem to. Alternatively, since he's on Cymbalta, it could be Treatment-Resistant Depression, but that's not a separate code. Or perhaps Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (subdural hematoma), but no clear link. Code F06.31 might apply if the depression is due to the hematoma, but he had depression before, so likely primary.\n\nWait, the subdural hematoma could cause neuropsychiatric symptoms, but he denies confusion, etc. So, probably not.\n\nAnother thought: the overdose could be considered a Suicide Attempt, but he denies intent. So, Suicidal Behavior Disorder is not in DSM-5 as a main diagnosis. So, maybe not.\n\nAlso, rule out Bipolar Disorder, but he denies mania, so unlikely.\n\nSo, my final list:\n\n1. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, severe without psychotic features - F33.2\n\n2. Alcohol Use Disorder, severe - F10.21\n\n3. Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder, moderate - F13.20\n\n4. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood - F43.21\n\n5. Other Specified Depressive Disorder - F32.89\n\nBut I need to ensure these are based only on the vignette. He is on Cymbalta for depression, so MDD is likely. The substance use disorders are clear. Adjustment Disorder might be comorbid. The fifth could be Benzodiazepine Intoxication (F13.129) instead of Other Specified Depressive Disorder.\n\nHowever, the overdose might be accidental or intentional, but since he denies suicide, it's not classified as such. In DSM-5, there's Other Specified Self-Harm (F68.8), which might apply if the overdose is self-harm without suicidal intent.\n\nBut the instructions say top five most likely diagnoses. Let's see the symptoms again: depressive symptoms, substance use, overdose, stressors. So, MDD, AUD, Sedative Use Disorder, Adjustment Disorder, and maybe Self-Harm.\n\nI think Self-Harm is relevant, but F68.8 is for other specified disorders of adult personality and behavior, which might not fit perfectly. Alternatively, Other Specified Mental Disorder (F99) but that's vague.\n\nPerhaps instead of Other Specified Depressive Disorder, include Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Intoxication (F13.129) since he was intoxicated at the time.\n\nBut the vignette says he was intoxicated from alcohol, and he took Klonopin, so it could be combined intoxication. However, for coding, we might list separate substance use disorders.\n\nAnother point: the subdural hematoma is a medical condition, but not psychiatric, so no F-code.\n\nFinal decision:\n\nPrimary: MDD, recurrent, severe (F33.2) because the symptoms are significant and he's already on an antidepressant, indicating ongoing issue.\n\nSecondary: Alcohol Use Disorder, severe (F10.21)\n\nThird: Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder, moderate (F13.20) based on the misuse of Klonopin.\n\nFourth: Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood (F43.21) due to the stressors.\n\nFifth: Other Specified Self-Harm (F68.8) for the overdose without suicidal intent.\n\nBut is Self-Harm a psychiatric diagnosis in DSM-5? It's listed as a condition for further study, not an official code. In ICD-10, there's Intentional Self-Harm (X codes), but not an F-code. So, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, Other Specified Mental Disorder (F99) but that's too vague.\n\nPerhaps Benzodiazepine Intoxication (F13.129) as he took a large dose and was intoxicated.\n\nI think for the fifth, since he has depressive symptoms and is on Cymbalta, but with recent relapse and overdose, maybe Unspecified Depressive Disorder (F32.9) but that's less specific.\n\nGiven the rubric, I need to be sophisticated in reasoning. The overdose in the context of depression and substance use could be seen as a suicide attempt, but he denies it. However, clinicians might still consider it as such. But since he denies intent, it's not classified as suicidal behavior disorder.\n\nIn practice, we might diagnose:\n\n1. Major Depressive Disorder\n\n2. Alcohol Use Disorder\n\n3. Sedative Use Disorder\n\n4. Adjustment Disorder\n\n5. Poisoning by benzodiazepines, but that's not an F-code.\n\nSo, for psychiatric diagnoses only, I'll stick with the above four and add a fifth like Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder (F43.8) for the stress response, but Adjustment Disorder already covers that.\n\nMaybe Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) (F34.1) if the depression is chronic, but he has MDD, so it could be comorbid.\n\nGiven the multi-decade history, perhaps Alcohol Use Disorder is primary, but the depression seems prominent.\n\nAfter organizing the data, I think the top five are as above. Let's confirm the codes:\n\n- F33.2: Major depressive disorder, recurrent severe without psychotic features\n\n- F10.21: Alcohol dependence, in remission? But he relapsed, so active. F10.20 is Alcohol abuse, but DSM-5 uses Alcohol Use Disorder, severe. ICD-10 has F10.20 for harmful use, but for dependence, it's F10.21. Since he has history of heavy use and rehab, likely dependence. So, F10.21.\n\n- F13.20: Sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic dependence, uncomplicated. For use disorder, it's F13.20 if moderate or F13.21 if severe. Given one event, moderate might be appropriate.\n\n- F43.21: Adjustment disorder with depressed mood\n\n- For the fifth, maybe F41.9: Unspecified anxiety disorder, but he denies anxiety. Or F99: Other mental disorder.\n\nWait, he has symptoms of depression but denies hopelessness, so maybe not full MDD. However, he has anhedonia, weight loss, sleep issues, concentration, crying. That's at least five symptoms, so meets criteria for major depressive episode.\n\nHe is on Cymbalta, which suggests previous diagnosis of depression.\n\nSo, I think the list is reasonable.\n\nNow, for the response, I need to output only the structured list without reasoning. So, I'll write:\n\n1. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, severe without psychotic features - F33.2\n\n2. Alcohol Use Disorder, severe - F10.21\n\n3. Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder, moderate - F13.20\n\n4. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood - F43.21\n\n5. Other Specified Self-Harm - F68.8\n\nBut F68.8 might not be correct for self-harm. In ICD-10, self-harm is under X codes for external causes. For mental disorders, there's F63.8 for other habit and impulse disorders, but not specifically self-harm.\n\nPerhaps instead, use F19.20 for other psychoactive substance use disorder, but he used benzodiazepines, which is under F13.\n\nI think for the fifth, since the overdose is a key event, and he denies suicide, it could be classified as Other Specified Mental Disorder due to another medical condition (the subdural hematoma might affect mood), but he has no symptoms. So, maybe F06.31 for depressive disorder due to subdural hematoma, but unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, since he has a head injury, consider Neurocognitive Disorder due to TBI, but no cognitive deficits reported other than concentration from depression.\n\nGiven the complexity, I'll go with the above four and for the fifth, use Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Intoxication (F13.129) as he was intoxicated from Klonopin and alcohol.\n\nBut the vignette says he was intoxicated from alcohol, and he took Klonopin, which might cause intoxication separately. So, F13.129 for benzodiazepine intoxication.\n\nHowever, intoxication is an acute condition, and he is in the ER, so it might be relevant.\n\nI think for psychiatric admission, the ongoing diagnoses are MDD, AUD, Sedative Use Disorder, and Adjustment Disorder. The intoxication might be resolved.\n\nSo, for the fifth, I'll use Other Specified Depressive Disorder (F32.89) to cover the depressive symptoms that might not fully meet MDD if we consider the medical condition, but I think they do.\n\nTo be precise, I'll check the DSM-5 criteria for MDD: He has depressed mood (lack of purpose, crying), anhedonia (wants to enjoy things again), weight loss, hypersomnia, fatigue, concentration issues, and feelings of worthlessness (feels no purpose). That's at least five, so meets criteria for major depressive episode. Since he has a history of depression on Cymbalta, it's recurrent. So, F33.2 is appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the list is as above.\n\nFinal answer.",

The user wants a strict DSM-5-TR diagnostic list without clinical reasoning, but following the expert rubric implicitly requires deep analysis.\n\nOkay, starting with Data Extraction: The case shows clear neurodevelopmental history - delayed speech at 48 months, social disengagement at 6 years, restricted interests (puzzles), and sensory behaviors (rocking\/spinning). Current data includes motor tics (eye blinking, neck contorting), complex vocal tics (racial slurs), and self-injurious behavior. The meltdowns over routine changes and need for sameness (puzzles) are prominent. No mood symptoms or psychosis noted.\n\nFor Diagnostic Reasoning: The core issue is lifelong social-communication deficits plus restricted\/repetitive behaviors meeting autism criteria. The tic disorder progression from simple to complex, including coprolalia, strongly suggests Tourette's. The explosive meltdowns when puzzles are removed could be pathological demand avoidance within autism, but DSM-5-TR would code it as part of ASD. Self-injurious slapping is likely either part of tic disorder or autism-related emotional dysregulation. \n\nDifferential priorities: Autism must be primary given early onset and pervasive symptoms. Tourette's is secondary due to clear motor\/vocal tics. The other three need to be conditions that commonly co-occur - ADHD often overlaps with both autism and tics, anxiety is nearly universal in this presentation, and the emotional outbursts warrant disruptive mood dysregulation consideration though limited by age criteria.\n\nWait, DMDD requires age 6-18 and the outbursts are present, but need to verify frequency. The meltdowns appear situation-specific (removing puzzles) rather than chronic irritability, so might not fully meet criteria. Still, it's a common differential item. Intellectual disability should be considered given speech delay, but cognitive testing isn't reported so can't assume. Better to list OCD given the \"have to do it\" comment about tics, though mother denies rituals.

    "model_thoughts":"First, I am considering the clinical case vignette about Ben, a 12-month-old infant. I need to focus on DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses, but the vignette describes physical and developmental issues. As a psychiatrist, I must look for any psychiatric conditions that might be present or associated with the described symptoms.\n\nThe vignette includes: Ben has unusual physical features (widely spaced eyes, low-set ears), a cat-like cry, low birth weight, heart issues, feeding problems, hypotonia, excessive drooling, microcephaly (small head), small jaw, and a fixed splitting of the second heart sound. There's also mention of genetic testing and difficulty when left alone, causing loud crying.\n\nKey points from the vignette:\n- Age: 12 months.\n- Physical abnormalities: craniofacial dysmorphism (eyes, ears), cat-like cry, heart defect, feeding issues, hypotonia, drooling, microcephaly, micrognathia.\n- Behavioral: Cries loudly when left alone for more than a minute.\n- Medical history: NICU stay for heart issue, under gastroenterologist for feeding problems, geneticist consultation.\n\nI need to base my diagnosis only on the information provided. The primary concern seems to be a genetic or congenital syndrome with physical and developmental implications. However, my task is to provide DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses. I must consider if there are any psychiatric conditions that can be diagnosed in infancy.\n\nDSM-5-TR includes disorders usually diagnosed in infancy, childhood, or adolescence. For a 12-month-old, possible psychiatric diagnoses might include:\n- Neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Intellectual Disability, Global Developmental Delay, or Communication Disorders.\n- Behavioral disorders, but at this age, specific diagnoses might be limited.\n\nThe vignette doesn't explicitly mention psychiatric symptoms like mood disorders, anxiety disorders, or psychotic disorders. The only behavioral note is that Ben cries when left alone, which could be normal separation anxiety for a 12-month-old, but it's described as excessive or distinctive.\n\nI recall that certain genetic syndromes have associated psychiatric or behavioral phenotypes. For example:\n- Cri-du-chat syndrome: Characterized by a cat-like cry, intellectual disability, microcephaly, hypotonia, and facial dysmorphism. This matches many features in the vignette: cat-like cry, small head, hypotonia, low birth weight, heart defects, feeding difficulties.\n- Other syndromes like Williams syndrome or Down syndrome, but the cat-like cry is specific to cri-du-chat.\n\nCri-du-chat syndrome is caused by a deletion on chromosome 5. It often involves severe intellectual disability and developmental delays.\n\nNow, for DSM-5-TR diagnoses:\n1. **Global Developmental Delay (F88)**: This is used for children under 5 years when clinical severity cannot be reliably assessed. Given Ben's age and multiple issues, developmental delay is likely.\n2. **Intellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder) (F70-F79)**: But at 12 months, it might be too early to diagnose definitively; Global Developmental Delay might be more appropriate.\n3. **Other neurodevelopmental disorders**: Perhaps associated with the genetic syndrome.\n\nThe vignette mentions awaiting genetic test results, which might confirm a specific syndrome, but for now, I need to base diagnoses on presented information.\n\nBehaviorally, the crying when left alone could indicate **Separation Anxiety Disorder**, but in DSM-5, this typically requires symptoms for at least 4 weeks in children and causing distress or impairment. It's mentioned, but not detailed. However, given the context, it might be part of developmental issues or related to the syndrome.\n\nPossible psychiatric diagnoses:\n- **Global Developmental Delay (F88)**\n- **Unspecified Neurodevelopmental Disorder (F89)** if specific criteria aren't met.\n- **Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition**? But no clear anxiety symptoms beyond crying.\n- **Feeding and Eating Disorders of Infancy or Early Childhood**: Ben has feeding problems, so perhaps **Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) (F50.8)** or **Feeding Disorder of Infancy or Early Childhood** (which is not in DSM-5; ARFID might cover it).\n\nIn DSM-5, feeding issues can be diagnosed as Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder, especially if associated with medical conditions.\n\nAlso, the heart defect and other medical issues might lead to **Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions (F54)**, but that's for when psychological factors adversely affect a medical condition. Here, it's not clear if psychological factors are involved.\n\nGiven the genetic syndrome likelihood, psychiatric diagnoses often co-occur with intellectual disability and developmental delays.\n\nTop 5 most likely DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses:\n1. **Global Developmental Delay (F88)** \u2013 This is a placeholder for significant delays in multiple areas of functioning.\n2. **Intellectual Disability, Severe (F72)** \u2013 If assuming based on syndrome, but might be premature; perhaps Unspecified Intellectual Disability.\n3. **Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (F50.8)** \u2013 Due to feeding problems requiring gastroenterologist.\n4. **Separation Anxiety Disorder (F93.0)** \u2013 Based on crying when left alone.\n5. **Other Specified Neurodevelopmental Disorder (F88)** or **Unspecified Neurodevelopmental Disorder (F89)** \u2013 For the broader syndrome effects.\n\nBut I need to be precise. Let's list diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes.\n\nICD-10 codes:\n- Global Developmental Delay: F88\n- Intellectual Disability: F70-F79, specific level based on severity.\n- Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder: F50.8\n- Separation Anxiety Disorder: F93.0\n- For genetic syndrome, DSM-5 might use **Neurodevelopmental Disorder Associated with a Known Medical or Genetic Condition** or something similar. In DSM-5, there is \"Neurodevelopmental Disorders\" and for specific conditions, it might be coded under the medical condition.\n\nDSM-5-TR includes codes for neurodevelopmental disorders due to known medical conditions, like **Intellectual Disability Due to Another Medical Condition**.\n\nGiven the vignette, the primary diagnosis might be related to the genetic syndrome. But since it's not confirmed, I should use what's observable.\n\nThe instruction is to base answer only on information provided. So, I should not assume the genetic syndrome, but the features strongly suggest Cri-du-chat syndrome.\n\nFor psychiatric diagnoses, the core issues are developmental and behavioral.\n\nStructured list:\n1. Primary diagnosis: **Global Developmental Delay** - ICD-10 F88\n2. Secondary diagnosis: **Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder** - ICD-10 F50.8\n3. Secondary diagnosis: **Separation Anxiety Disorder** - ICD-10 F93.0\n4. Secondary diagnosis: **Unspecified Intellectual Disability** - ICD-10 F79\n5. Secondary diagnosis: **Other Specified Neurodevelopmental Disorder** - ICD-10 F88 (or F89)\n\nI need to check ICD-10 codes accurately:\n- F88: Other disorders of psychological development\n- F79: Unspecified intellectual disability\n- F50.8: Other eating disorders (ARFID falls here)\n- F93.0: Separation anxiety disorder of childhood\n\nFor Global Developmental Delay, DSM-5 uses it for children under 5, and it's coded as F88 in ICD-10.\n\nNow, prioritize: The primary diagnosis should be the most significant one. Given the multiple abnormalities and developmental concerns, Global Developmental Delay seems primary.\n\nBut in DSM-5, if a genetic syndrome is known, Intellectual Disability due to another medical condition might be used. Since genetic testing is pending, I can use unspecified versions.\n\nThe crying when left alone: At 12 months, separation anxiety is developmentally typical, but if it's excessive, it could be a disorder. The vignette says \"hard time leaving him alone for more than 1 minute before he starts crying loudly\" \u2013 this might indicate heightened separation distress, possibly due to the syndrome or general vulnerability.\n\nFeeding problems are prominent, so ARFID is likely.\n\nAnother consideration: **Reactive Attachment Disorder**? But no mention of neglect or abuse; parents are involved, so probably not.\n\n**Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder**? No.\n\n**Autism Spectrum Disorder**? No social or communication specifics, but hypotonia and developmental delays could be associated. However, not enough information.\n\nGiven the cat-like cry and physical features, Cri-du-chat syndrome is highly probable, which often includes intellectual disability and developmental delays.\n\nSo, for psychiatric diagnoses:\n1. Global Developmental Delay (F88)\n2. Intellectual Disability, Severity Unspecified (F79) \u2013 since age 12 months, severity might not be determined.\n3. Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (F50.8)\n4. Separation Anxiety Disorder (F93.0)\n5. Perhaps **Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition** (F06.4) if the crying is anxiety-related to medical issues.\n\nBut F06.4 is for anxiety disorders due to known physiological condition. Since medical condition is suspected, it could be.\n\nI think Global Developmental Delay covers the developmental aspects.\n\nList in order of likelihood:\n1. Global Developmental Delay - F88\n2. Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder - F50.8\n3. Separation Anxiety Disorder - F93.0\n4. Unspecified Intellectual Disability - F79\n5. Other Specified Neurodevelopmental Disorder - F88 (or F89 for unspecified)\n\nBut \"Other Specified Neurodevelopmental Disorder\" might be redundant with Global Developmental Delay.\n\nIn DSM-5, Global Developmental Delay is a diagnosis for young children when specific intellectual disability cannot be confirmed. So, it might be the primary.\n\nTo be precise, I'll go with:\n1. Global Developmental Delay - F88\n2. Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder - F50.8\n3. Separation Anxiety Disorder - F93.0\n4. Unspecified Intellectual Disability - F79\n5. Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (assuming the genetic syndrome) - F06.4\n\nBut for F06.4, it requires the anxiety to be a prominent part of the clinical picture. The crying when left alone might be separation anxiety rather than generalized anxiety.\n\nPerhaps **Other Specified Anxiety Disorder** for separation anxiety if it doesn't meet full criteria, but F93.0 is for separation anxiety disorder.\n\nThe vignette doesn't specify duration or impairment for separation anxiety, so it might be subclinical, but I have to use what's given.\n\nI should not fabricate details; based on \"hard time leaving him alone for more than 1 minute before he starts crying loudly,\" it suggests significant distress, so Separation Anxiety Disorder is plausible.\n\nFinally, the heart sound finding is medical, not psychiatric.\n\nSo, my list:\n1. Global Developmental Delay - F88\n2. Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder - F50.8\n3. Separation Anxiety Disorder - F93.0\n4. Unspecified Intellectual Disability - F79\n5. Other Specified Neurodevelopmental Disorder (for the broader syndrome effects) - F88\n\nBut F88 is used for both Global Developmental Delay and Other Specified Disorders of Psychological Development. In ICD-10, F88 is \"Other disorders of psychological development,\" which can include specific disorders.\n\nTo avoid repetition, I can use F89 for Unspecified Disorder of Psychological Development.\n\nLet's check ICD-10:\n- F88: Other disorders of psychological development (includes specific developmental disorders)\n- F89: Unspecified disorder of psychological development\n\nFor Global Developmental Delay, it's often coded as F88.\n\nIn DSM-5, Global Developmental Delay is coded as 315.8, which corresponds to F88 in ICD-10.\n\nSo, for the list, I'll use:\n1. Global Developmental Delay - F88\n2. Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder - F50.8\n3. Separation Anxiety Disorder - F93.0\n4. Unspecified Intellectual Disability - F79\n5. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder (if separation anxiety is not fully meeting criteria, but I think F93.0 is fine) or perhaps no fifth, but I need five diagnoses.\n\nI need to provide five diagnoses. Perhaps include **Adjustment Disorder**? No stressor mentioned.\n\n**Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions (F54)** could be considered if the crying or behavior affects medical care, but not specified.\n\nGiven the genetic syndrome likelihood, and in psychiatry, for such cases, intellectual disability and developmental delays are key.\n\nI think the top five are as above.\n\nTo confirm, the primary diagnosis should be the most encompassing: Global Developmental Delay.\n\nNow, format as per instruction:\n1. <Primary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n2. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n3. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n4. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n5. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n\nSo, my response:\n1. Global Developmental Delay - F88\n2. Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder - F50.8\n3. Separation Anxiety Disorder - F93.0\n4. Unspecified Intellectual Disability - F79\n5. Other Specified Neurodevelopmental Disorder - F88\n\nBut using F88 twice might be confusing. For \"Other Specified Neurodevelopmental Disorder,\" in ICD-10, it might be F89 for unspecified, or F88 for specified.\n\nIn DSM-5, \"Other Specified Neurodevelopmental Disorder\" is coded as 315.8, which is F88 in ICD-10. Similarly, Global Developmental Delay is also 315.8, F88. So, they share the same code.\n\nTo differentiate, I can use F89 for one, but F89 is for unspecified.\n\nPerhaps for Intellectual Disability, use F78 for other specified intellectual disability, but F79 is unspecified.\n\nI think it's acceptable to use F88 for both if they are different diagnoses, but in this case, Global Developmental Delay and Other Specified Neurodevelopmental Disorder might overlap.\n\nPerhaps instead of Other Specified Neurodevelopmental Disorder, use **Neurodevelopmental Disorder Associated with a Known Medical Condition** but since it's not confirmed, unspecified.\n\nTo simplify, since Global Developmental Delay is already covering developmental issues, I might not need the fifth as a separate neurodevelopmental disorder.\n\nAlternative: include **Disorder of Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence Not Otherwise Specified** but that's vague.\n\nAnother idea: **Stereotypic Movement Disorder**? No mention of stereotypes.\n\n**Sleep-Wake Disorder**? Not mentioned.\n\nFeeding disorder is already included.\n\nI think four are sufficient, but the instruction says top five, so I need five.\n\nPerhaps **Anxiety Disorder Not Otherwise Specified** for the crying, but Separation Anxiety Disorder is specific.\n\nThe crying is described as cat-like, which is a physical characteristic, not necessarily psychiatric. The behavioral aspect is the distress when left alone.\n\nSo, Separation Anxiety Disorder is appropriate.\n\nFor the fifth, since genetic syndrome is suspected, **Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions (F54)** could be used if the infant's behavior impacts medical treatment, but not stated.\n\nI'll go with **Other Specified Anxiety Disorder (F41.8)** for general anxiety related to medical condition, but separation anxiety is already anxiety.\n\nPerhaps **Unspecified Disorder of Psychological Development (F89)** as a catch-all.\n\nI think for consistency, I'll use:\n1. Global Developmental Delay - F88\n2. Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder - F50.8\n3. Separation Anxiety Disorder - F93.0\n4. Unspecified Intellectual Disability - F79\n5. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder - F41.8\n\nBut let's see if there's a better fit.\n\nUpon second thought, in cri-du-chat syndrome, behavioral issues can include hyperactivity, self-injury, etc., but not mentioned. So, stick to what's in vignette.\n\nThe vignette says \"Ben looks very different\" and physical features, but no psychiatric symptoms beyond crying and feeding issues.\n\nPerhaps the primary diagnosis should be Intellectual Disability, but at 12 months, Global Developmental Delay is more appropriate.\n\nI think my list is reasonable.\n\nFinal decision:\n1. Global Developmental Delay - F88\n2. Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder - F50.8\n3. Separation Anxiety Disorder - F93.0\n4. Unspecified Intellectual Disability - F79\n5. Other Specified Neurodevelopmental Disorder - F88\n\nTo avoid same code, for Other Specified Neurodevelopmental Disorder, in ICD-10, it might be coded under F84.8 for other pervasive developmental disorders, but that's for autism spectrum. Not accurate.\n\nIn ICD-10, neurodevelopmental disorders are under F80-F89. F88 is for other disorders, F89 for unspecified.\n\nI'll use F89 for the fifth: Unspecified Disorder of Psychological Development.\n\nYes:\n1. Global Developmental Delay - F88\n2. Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder - F50.8\n3. Separation Anxiety Disorder - F93.0\n4. Unspecified Intellectual Disability - F79\n5. Unspecified Disorder of Psychological Development - F89\n\nThis covers all bases.",

The patient's lack of distress and normal functioning apart from the visual symptoms helps narrow the possibilities.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the clinical vignette. Collin is 13, brought by his mother because he's talking back and kicking her. He seems calm in the exam room, but his mother says his behavior changed about a week ago\u2014he became sad, stopped playing video games, and stayed in his room. Collin himself mentions not feeling like himself, lacking energy to play with friends, reduced appetite, and thoughts about the world being better without him. He denies suicide plans or self-harm.\n\nThe timeline is important here. The mother notes that two weeks ago, the father lost his job, and the family might have to move. Collin feels tired despite sleeping 10 hours a night, has trouble concentrating, and failed multiple exams recently. He denies mania, psychosis, trauma, substance use, or anxiety. The mother adds that when he's not sad, he's angry, engaging in property destruction and bullying siblings.\n\nHmm, the core symptoms point to depressive features: sad mood, anhedonia (not playing games), fatigue, concentration issues, and thoughts of worthlessness. The irritability and aggression are notable, especially in adolescents, where depression can manifest as irritability rather than just sadness. The onset seems acute, tied to the stressor of the father's job loss and potential move.\n\nBut wait, the mother mentions \"if he is not sad and crying, he is angry and kicking me.\" That's a key detail\u2014alternating between sadness and anger. The property destruction and bullying siblings suggest behavioral issues. Could this be a disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD)? He's 13, and DMDD requires severe recurrent temper outbursts and persistent irritability between outbursts. The vignette mentions anger and kicking, but it's not clear if the irritability is persistent between episodes. Also, DMDD symptoms must be present for at least 12 months, and here it's only about a week or two.\n\nMaybe it's a major depressive episode with mixed features? He has depressive symptoms but also irritability and aggression. However, the vignette denies mania, so bipolar might not fit. Adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct is a strong possibility given the clear stressor (father's job loss, moving) and the mix of depressive symptoms and behavioral issues.\n\nOppositional defiant disorder (ODD) could be considered due to the talking back, anger, and defiance, but ODD usually has a longer pattern, not just a week or two. The acute onset following a stressor leans more toward adjustment disorder.\n\nIntermittent explosive disorder is another thought because of the aggression, but that requires recurrent outbursts, and the timeline here is too short.\n\nAnxiety is denied, so rule that out. No trauma history, so PTSD isn't likely. Substance use is denied too.\n\nPutting it all together, the primary issue seems to be an adjustment disorder with mixed emotional and behavioral symptoms, given the acute stressor and the combination of depression and conduct problems. Major depressive disorder is a close second because of the clear depressive symptoms, but the acute stressor and behavioral components make adjustment disorder more fitting as the primary. DMDD is less likely due to the short duration. ODD and IED are possible but not as aligned with the acute stress response.",

To manage this distress, she keeps tweezers on her person at all times, checks mirrors every 30 minutes when at home, and avoids staying home for extended periods. She also exhibits contamination concerns manifesting as excessive handwashing (25+ times daily) and using barriers to avoid direct contact with \"unclean\" surfaces out of fear of contracting an illness. Patient believes that she must act on her physical sensations or contamination-related thoughts most of the time or the distress will persist. Patient also collects items like My Little Ponies and Trolls. She has filled her home, garage, basement, a rented warehouse, and now pays to store items in a neighbor's garage despite saying she has little to no money to pay for these expenses. She expresses strong attachment to these possessions, stating she would \"NEVER\" sell them, and has a history of repurchasing items she previously attempted to sell. Patient's medical history is significant for AIDS (diagnosed 2003, currently on Odefsey), and past surgical interventions following a car accident. Her psychological history includes previous diagnoses of PTSD and Bipolar Disorder (which she disputes). Current symptoms of a major depressive episode include anhedonia, restlessness, sleep disturbance (averaging 4 hours nightly), feelings of worthlessness, and difficulty concentrating. These episodes emerge roughly every few month. The patient denied symptoms of psychosis as well as symptoms related to higher than usual energy or goal-directed activity at any time in the past. She endorsed suicidal ideation without current plan or intent, rating likelihood of attempt at 1%. Social support is reportedly limited, with the patient living alone with her two dogs, having infrequent contact with her daughter, and minimal social connections beyond casual acquaintances while shopping.

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, the user has provided a detailed clinical case vignette and wants me to generate a structured list of DSM-5-TR diagnoses based on the information given. I need to follow the specific formatting and only include the top five diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes.\n\nFirst, I'll extract key symptoms from the vignette. The patient has not-just-right sensations about hair and bumps, which leads to checking mirrors frequently and carrying tweezers. There's also contamination concerns with excessive handwashing and avoidance behaviors. These point towards obsessive-compulsive symptoms.\n\nShe collects items extensively, filling multiple spaces, and has strong attachment to them despite financial strain. This suggests hoarding behavior. The depression symptoms like anhedonia, sleep issues, worthlessness, and concentration problems indicate a major depressive episode. The mention of past PTSD and bipolar disorder, but she disputes bipolar and denies manic symptoms, so I need to consider if bipolar is still relevant. However, the vignette says episodes emerge every few months, which might point to recurrent depression rather than bipolar.\n\nAlso, the patient has a trauma history but denies distress or impairment from it, so PTSD might not be current. The medical history includes AIDS, which is important but not a psychiatric diagnosis, so I won't include it.\n\nNow, prioritizing the diagnoses: the OCD symptoms are prominent, so that could be primary. Hoarding is separate but significant. Major depressive disorder is recurrent based on the episodes. I should rule out bipolar since she denies manic symptoms. Trauma-related disorders might be considered but she denies impairment, so it's lower priority.\n\nLet me list them in order of likelihood based on the symptoms described. OCD first, then hoarding disorder, major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder if the depression is chronic, and maybe unspecified trauma-related disorder if applicable. But since she denies distress from trauma, perhaps adjustment disorder isn't fitting. Alternatively, other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder could cover the not-just-right sensations if they don't fully meet OCD criteria.\n\nWait, the contamination concerns and checking behaviors align with OCD. The hoarding is separate but often comorbid. Depression is clearly present. I need to check if the depression is part of bipolar, but she disputes bipolar and no manic symptoms, so recurrent depressive disorder makes sense. For trauma, maybe other specified trauma disorder if history is complex but no current PTSD symptoms.\n\nFinally, ensuring the F-codes are correct for each diagnosis. OCD is F42, hoarding F42.3, major depressive disorder recurrent F33.9, persistent depressive disorder F34.1, and other specified trauma disorder F43.8. Let me double-check the hoarding code: yes, it's F42.3 in ICD-10. Okay, that should cover the top five.",

He currently works full-time managing his hot tub repair company and lives with his girlfriend. His medical history includes multiple substance addictions, particularly opioids (requiring Suboxone and later Methadone treatment), and previous diagnoses of OCD, ADHD, anxiety disorder, and depressive disorder. He reports a significant history of head trauma (8 concussions), one seizure episode while incarcerated, and multiple incarcerations for offenses including gun possession, burglary, and vehicle theft. His psychiatric medication history includes Adderall, Concerta, Zoloft, an unspecified antidepressant, and Trazodone. The chief complaint involves symptoms that began at approximately age 18 during his first incarceration and have intensified in the past year, coinciding with work stress. Problematic behaviors include arranging items in specific places with extreme rigidity (unable to buy new items that don't have a \"place\"), performing rituals in sets of three, and a specific handwashing ritual. He experiences intrusive thoughts about harming others (particularly fears of stabbing, shooting, or raping strangers) and engages in compulsive behaviors (brushing his hand from hairline to ear three times) to alleviate associated anxiety. He also reports persistent checking behaviors due to memory doubts, a need for things to feel \"just right\", and specific ordering rituals. Additionally, he endorses current anhedonia, decreased appetite, fatigue, and concentration difficulties that wax and wane every few months. He shared that these symptoms are distressing, though mildly impairing in his social, work, and leisurely activities. He denies current suicidality, self-harm, or hallucinations\/delusions. He reports a childhood history of conduct problems (skipping school, lying, stealing, fighting) and adult behaviors including illegal activities, irresponsibility, deceitfulness (e.g., using fake identifications) and reported guiltlessness after harming others or damaging property. His childhood conduct problems (e.g., fighting) have resulting in the concussions reported in the medical history, and his illegal activities have resulted in two incarcerations. When asked about one such activity (stealing a car), he reported no remorse, instead blaming the victim for calling the police. The assessment revealed that these behaviors have continued for years in multiple settings, though as of late, he reported that he has not engaged in any illegal activities because he does not want to return to jail for a third time.",

Unwanted thoughts include fears of transmitting sexual fluids to others (which he believes would make him \"a rapist\"), concerns about accidentally killing insects, moral distress about consuming animal products, and beliefs that viewing violent media constitutes \"condoning\" violence. To manage these thoughts, he engages in extensive reassurance seeking, repeatedly checking lab results at work, avoiding video games and television, dietary restrictions, and some handwashing.

In DSM-5, Excoriation Disorder is separate from OCD.\n\n**Step 2: Consider depressive symptoms.**\n\nThe patient has a history of MDD and current depressive symptoms: passive suicidal ideation, anhedonia, decreased appetite, sleep issues, psychomotor agitation, worthlessness, concentration problems. There are past suicide attempts. This could indicate a current Major Depressive Episode, possibly recurrent.\n\n**Step 3: Social anxiety symptoms.**\n\nPersistent fear of judgment, rumination, reassurance-seeking \u2013 this aligns with Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia).\n\n**Step 4: ADHD diagnosis.**\n\nADHD was diagnosed in 2018 and is being treated with Lisdexamfetamine. The vignette doesn't specify current ADHD symptoms, but since it's a chronic condition and medication is ongoing, it should be considered.\n\n**Step 5: Trauma and PTSD.**\n\nPTSD was diagnosed in 2016 from emotional abuse, and there's history of sexual abuse, but the patient denies PTSD symptoms now. However, the diagnosis might still be relevant if symptoms are present or in remission. But for current diagnosis, if symptoms are denied, it might not be active. The vignette says \"denied PTSD symptoms\" in the context of sexual abuse, but PTSD was previously diagnosed from emotional abuse. I need to see if current PTSD is indicated. The patient has intrusive thoughts, but those are more OCD-related. Avoidance, hyperarousal aren't explicitly mentioned. So, PTSD might not be the primary focus.\n\n**Step 6: Eating behaviors.**\n\nBinge eating episodes with fasting afterwards \u2013 this could indicate Bulimia Nervosa or Binge-Eating Disorder. However, the episodes occurred less than once per week and haven't happened in the past 2 months. For Bulimia Nervosa, binge eating and compensatory behaviors (like fasting) need to occur at least once a week for three months. Here, it's less frequent and not recent, so it might not meet full criteria. But it could be specified as in partial remission or other specified feeding or eating disorder.\n\n**Step 7: Perfectionism and \"not just right\" feelings.**\n\nThese are classic for OCD, but also could be related to Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD). However, OCPD is a personality disorder, and the symptoms here seem more ego-dystonic and cause distress, which is more typical of OCD rather than OCPD.\n\n**Step 8: Skin-picking.**\n\nThis could be Excoriation Disorder, which is separate from OCD in DSM-5. It's characterized by recurrent skin picking resulting in lesions, with attempts to stop, and causing distress or impairment.\n\n**Step 9: Overall diagnostic picture.**\n\nThe patient has multiple comorbid conditions. The primary diagnosis should be the one causing the most significant current impairment. From the vignette, the OCD-like symptoms (reorganizing, checking, intrusive thoughts) seem very impairing, spending up to 12 hours, affecting deadlines and social obligations.\n\nAlso, depressive symptoms are current and significant, but they might be secondary to OCD or co-occurring.\n\nSocial anxiety is also present and affecting friendships.\n\nADHD is a chronic condition.\n\nBinge eating might be in remission.\n\n**Step 10: List top 5 diagnoses with F-codes.**\n\nI need to provide the primary diagnosis and four secondary diagnoses. Since the instructions say \"top 5 most likely diagnoses,\" I should prioritize based on severity and current presentation.\n\nPrimary diagnosis: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) \u2013 F42.2 (Mixed obsessional thoughts and acts) or F42.8 (Other obsessive-compulsive disorder). In DSM-5, OCD is coded as F42.2 for with poor insight, but typically F42.0 to F42.9 based on specifiers. For simplicity, I'll use F42.9 for unspecified OCD. But to be precise, based on symptoms, it might be F42.2.\n\nChecking ICD-10 codes:\n- OCD: F42.8 or F42.9. Commonly F42.9 for unspecified.\n- Major Depressive Disorder: F33.x for recurrent depressive disorder. Current episode might be moderate or severe. Since there are suicide attempts and multiple symptoms, F33.2 for recurrent depressive disorder, current episode severe without psychotic symptoms, or F33.1 for moderate. But for coding, I can use F33.9 for unspecified.\n- Social Anxiety Disorder: F40.10 for social phobia, unspecified.\n- ADHD: F90.2 for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, combined type, or F90.9 for unspecified. Since diagnosed and on stimulant, likely F90.9.\n- Excoriation Disorder: F42.4 for other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, or specifically L98.1 for dermatological, but psychiatric code is F42.4 under OCD-related disorders. In ICD-10, excoriation disorder is classified under F42.8 or F42.9, but DSM-5 has it as separate. ICD-10-CM has L98.1 for excoriation, but for psychiatric diagnosis, it might be under F42.4 or F63.8. Actually, in ICD-10, skin-picking disorder is not specifically coded; it might fall under F42.8. For DSM-5, it's 698.4 (L98.1 in ICD-10-CM), but for F-codes, I need psychiatric codes. I should use F42.4 for other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, which can include skin-picking.\n\nTo align with DSM-5-TR and ICD-10 F-codes:\n- OCD: F42.2 or F42.9\n- MDD: F33.1 or F33.9\n- Social Anxiety Disorder: F40.10\n- ADHD: F90.9\n- Excoriation Disorder: F42.4\n\nBut binge eating might be considered. Since it's not current, I might not include it in top 5. The skin-picking seems current and significant.\n\nAlso, the patient has history of PTSD, but if denying symptoms, it might be in remission or not current.\n\nFor the list, I need five diagnoses.\n\nLet me prioritize:\n\n1. Primary: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder \u2013 most impairing based on hours spent and distress.\n2. Secondary: Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, current episode \u2013 due to current depressive symptoms and history.\n3. Secondary: Social Anxiety Disorder \u2013 persistent fear and impairment in social functioning.\n4. Secondary: Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder \u2013 diagnosed and on medication, chronic condition.\n5. Secondary: Excoriation (Skin-Picking) Disorder \u2013 separate from OCD, causing distress and impairment.\n\nFor binge eating, since it's not in the past 2 months and less frequent, it might be other specified feeding or eating disorder, but I'll skip it for top 5.\n\nNow, for ICD-10 codes:\n- OCD: F42.2 (Mixed obsessional thoughts and acts) or F42.9 (Obsessive-compulsive disorder, unspecified). I'll use F42.9 for simplicity.\n- Major Depressive Disorder: F33.1 (Recurrent depressive disorder, current episode moderate) or F33.2 (severe). Based on symptoms, it might be moderate to severe. I'll use F33.9 for unspecified.\n- Social Anxiety Disorder: F40.10 (Social phobia, unspecified).\n- ADHD: F90.9 (Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, unspecified).\n- Excoriation Disorder: In ICD-10, it's often coded under F42.4 (Other obsessive-compulsive disorders) or L98.1, but L98.1 is not an F-code. For psychiatric diagnosis, DSM-5 code is 698.4, which corresponds to L98.1 in ICD-10-CM, but for F-codes, I need to use psychiatric chapters. In ICD-10, skin-picking disorder is classified under F63.8 (Other habit and impulse disorders) or F42.8. Upon checking, in DSM-5, excoriation disorder is under obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, and ICD-10-CM code is L98.1, but for mental disorders, it might be F42.4. To be safe, since the instruction says \"DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses\" with \"ICD-10 F-codes\", I should use F-codes from Chapter V (Mental and behavioural disorders).\n\nFor excoriation disorder in ICD-10, it is not specifically listed; it may be included under F42.8 (Other obsessive-compulsive disorders) or F63.8 (Other habit and impulse disorders). DSM-5 classifies it under obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, so F42.4 might be appropriate for \"other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder\".\n\nI recall that in ICD-10, trichotillomania is F63.3, and excoriation might be similar. But for this response, I'll use F42.4 for other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, as per DSM-5.\n\nAlternatively, for skin-picking, it could be F42.8.\n\nTo standardize, I'll use:\n1. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder - F42.9\n2. Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent Episode - F33.9\n3. Social Anxiety Disorder - F40.10\n4. Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder - F90.9\n5. Excoriation (Skin-Picking) Disorder - F42.4\n\nBut for MDD, since it's recurrent and current, F33.1 might be better. However, the vignette doesn't specify severity, so F33.9 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, for OCD, F42.9.\n\nI should ensure that the diagnoses are based on DSM-5-TR criteria. Let me verify:\n\n- OCD: Presence of obsessions (intrusive thoughts, \"not just right\" feelings) and compulsions (reorganizing, checking), time-consuming, cause distress. Yes.\n- MDD: Current depressive episode with symptoms like anhedonia, sleep issues, worthlessness, etc. History of past episodes and suicide attempts. Yes.\n- Social Anxiety Disorder: Marked fear of social situations, avoidance or distress, impairment. Yes.\n- ADHD: Diagnosed, on medication. Symptoms not detailed but diagnosis given. Should be included.\n- Excoriation Disorder: Recurrent skin picking, attempts to stop, causes lesions, distress. Yes.\n\nBinge eating might be considered, but since not current, I'll leave it out.\n\nPTSD might be in remission, so not current.\n\nFinal list in order:\n\n1. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder - F42.9\n2. Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent - F33.9\n3. Social Anxiety Disorder - F40.10\n4. Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder - F90.9\n5. Excoriation Disorder - F42.4\n\nFor formatting, as per instructions:\n1. <Primary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n2. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n3. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n4. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n5. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n\nSo, I need to list them in this order.\n\nI think OCD is primary due to the detailed description of impairing symptoms.",

    "vignette":"The patient is an 18-year-old non-binary college freshman with a complex psychiatric presentation. They report a history of childhood anxiety, perfectionism, and ritualistic self-punishment behaviors starting in the third grade. Currently, their most debilitating symptom is anxiety about \"contaminated air\" when others cough or sneeze, prompting them to cover their face and hold their breath even when the trigger is far away or on television. They engage in checking and counting behaviors based on the number 3, including checking mirrors while driving, locking\/unlocking their car, and tapping their toothbrush. These compulsions are experienced as uncontrollable, with the patient reporting they sometimes modify behaviors (like holding an imaginary door handle in their pocket) when the original compulsion would be disruptive. At approximately age 16, the patient developed anorexia nervosa, restricting their food intake and ultimately requiring intervention from parents and a treatment team. Despite gaining weight under external pressure, the patient continues to restrict eating, has a distinct fear of gaining weight, becoming fat, fasting until dinner, drinking coffee to intentionally upset their stomach. Their BMI currently falls within the normal range. Around the same time their eating disorder developed, the patient experienced depressive symptoms including hopelessness, low motivation, and self-harm behaviors (pulling hair, cutting, punching stomach). They had suicidal ideation during high school, including thoughts of jumping in front of a train and fantasizing about wandering into hallways during a school shooting. Current suicidal thoughts are less frequent and persistent. Current depressive symptoms have been subsyndromal (though not entirely absent) for about 7 months. Specifically, the patient currently denies experiencing depressive symptoms for more than a few hours every couple of weeks but rates their chance of self-harm in the next three months at 50% (suicide attempt chance at 0%). They report minimal alcohol and marijuana use. Notably, the patient expresses resistance to treatment, stating that \"getting better means getting fat\" and feeling they need to \"stay sad for a while longer\".",

    "model_thoughts":"Hmm, this is a complex psychiatric case with multiple overlapping symptoms. The patient presents with anxiety about contamination, checking and counting compulsions, which strongly suggests obsessive-compulsive disorder. The history of anorexia nervosa with ongoing restrictive behaviors and fear of weight gain is prominent. There's also a history of depressive symptoms and self-harm, though currently subsyndromal. The mention of ritualistic self-punishment since childhood might indicate obsessive-compulsive personality traits. Given the patient's age and symptom onset, adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood should be considered due to the transition to college. \n\nThe primary diagnosis should be obsessive-compulsive disorder given the ego-dystonic nature of the compulsions and anxiety-driven obsessions.

    "vignette":"The patient is a 22-year-old female from the Southeastern United States with a history of Depression (2019), Anxiety (2019), and OCD (March 2021). She recently transitioned from working as a childcare specialist to self-employment as a freelancer. Her medical history includes anemia and IBS, for which she takes daily iron supplements. The patient previously attempted treatment with Zoloft (10mg) for OCD symptoms but discontinued due to emotional blunting effects. She reports consuming alcohol 1-2 glasses a few times monthly and using marijuana daily when available, which she finds helpful for intrusive thoughts despite occasionally triggering anxiety. The patient's most distressing symptoms involve intrusive thoughts about sexually harming children, accompanied by physiological responses that she describes as \"groinal\". These thoughts were particularly distressing during her work as a childcare specialist, where she engaged in compulsive staring at children's genital areas to \"prove\" she wasn't sexually attracted to them and sometimes avoided changing diapers due to fear of sexual arousal. After experiencing an intrusive dream about sexually harming her brother in January 2021, she experienced physical symptoms (shaking, freezing) when interacting with him and subsequently increased their time together as a form of reassurance. Additionally, the patient reports significant health anxiety focused on getting cancer, HIV, and STIs, leading to excessive symptom research. The patient experiences panic attacks (1-2 times monthly) lasting 15-30 minutes when triggered by intrusive thoughts, with symptoms including shortness of breath, crying, sweating, racing heart, chest pain, and feelings of detachment. She reports seeking reassurance from her mother when these thoughts become overwhelming. The patient also endorses distressing and functionally impairing social anxiety in small groups, leading to significant avoidance; however, she stated that this anxiety is primary due to her unwanted\/intrusive thoughts rather than a fear of being judged. She reports experiencing over 50 depressive episodes in the past year, each lasting at least two weeks with symptoms including decreased appetite, sleep disturbance, fatigue, guilt, concentration difficulties, and thoughts of death. She described these episodes as challenging to manage, but \"not completely debilitating\".",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the clinical vignette provided. The patient is a 22-year-old female with a history of Depression, Anxiety, and OCD since 2019-2021. She has intrusive thoughts about sexually harming children, which caused distress during her childcare work. She engaged in compulsive behaviors like staring at children's genital areas to prove she wasn't attracted to them and avoided changing diapers. There's also mention of an intrusive dream about harming her brother leading to physical symptoms and increased time with him as reassurance.\n\nShe has health anxiety focused on cancer, HIV, and STIs, leading to excessive research. Panic attacks occur 1-2 times monthly triggered by intrusive thoughts, with symptoms like shortness of breath, racing heart, etc. Social anxiety is present but linked to her intrusive thoughts rather than fear of judgment. She reports over 50 depressive episodes in the past year, each lasting at least two weeks with typical depressive symptoms.\n\nFirst, I need to extract key symptoms and organize them logically. The primary issue seems to be obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) given the intrusive thoughts (sexual harm towards children and brother), compulsive behaviors (staring, avoidance, reassurance-seeking), and the distress they cause. The history mentions OCD diagnosed in March 2021, and she tried Zoloft but stopped due to side effects. The \"groinal\" responses are typical in OCD related to sexual obsessions.\n\nNext, the depressive episodes. She mentions over 50 episodes in the past year, each lasting at least two weeks. That sounds like recurrent depressive episodes, possibly Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent. However, the frequency seems unusually high\u2014over 50 in a year would mean almost weekly episodes, which might suggest a different pattern like persistent depressive disorder with recurrent major episodes, but DSM-5 criteria for Major Depressive Disorder require episodes lasting at least two weeks, so if each episode meets criteria, it could still be MDD recurrent. But given the high frequency, perhaps it's more chronic with exacerbations.\n\nPanic attacks are present, triggered by intrusive thoughts. This might be Panic Disorder if the attacks are unexpected, but here they're linked to specific triggers (intrusive thoughts), so perhaps they are part of OCD or possibly a separate panic disorder. However, the vignette says they occur when triggered by intrusive thoughts, so maybe they're not unexpected, thus not meeting full panic disorder criteria. Could be panic attacks specifier under OCD or another disorder.\n\nHealth anxiety involves excessive worry about illnesses like cancer, HIV, STIs, leading to compulsive research. This sounds like Illness Anxiety Disorder, especially since she's focused on having a serious illness despite no diagnosed medical condition (aside from anemia and IBS). Alternatively, it could be somatic symptom disorder, but she's more worried about the illness rather than symptoms, so Illness Anxiety Disorder fits better.\n\nSocial anxiety is noted but she says it's primary due to her intrusive thoughts rather than fear of judgment. This might not meet full criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder if the fear is specifically about her thoughts being revealed, not general social evaluation. However, it causes significant avoidance, so it could still be a comorbid condition.\n\nSubstance use: daily marijuana when available, which she finds helpful for intrusive thoughts but sometimes triggers anxiety. This might be Cannabis Use Disorder if there's impairment, but the vignette doesn't specify dependence or abuse criteria, so perhaps not a primary diagnosis. Alcohol use is minimal.\n\nOther medical history: anemia and IBS, which are not psychiatric, so I won't include them.\n\nNow, constructing the differential diagnosis list:\n\n1. Primary: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The intrusive thoughts about harming children, compulsive behaviors (staring, avoidance, reassurance-seeking), and distress are classic. The \"groinal\" responses are common in OCD with sexual obsessions. History of OCD diagnosis in March 2021 supports this.\n\n2. Secondary: Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent. She reports over 50 episodes in the past year, each lasting at least two weeks with symptoms like decreased appetite, sleep disturbance, fatigue, guilt, concentration issues, thoughts of death. This meets criteria for recurrent MDD, though the frequency is high, so maybe it's chronic with recurrent episodes. The vignette says \"over 50 depressive episodes,\" which is unusual, but each meets duration criteria, so I'll go with recurrent MDD.\n\n3. Secondary: Illness Anxiety Disorder. Excessive health anxiety about cancer, HIV, STIs, leading to compulsive research. She doesn't have diagnosed conditions, so this fits. Could be considered under OCD spectrum, but DSM-5 separates it.\n\n4. Secondary: Panic Disorder. She has panic attacks 1-2 times monthly with symptoms like shortness of breath, racing heart, chest pain, detachment. They are triggered by intrusive thoughts, but panic attacks can be triggered in panic disorder as well. However, DSM-5 requires unexpected attacks for panic disorder. Here, they're triggered, so maybe they're not unexpected. Alternatively, it could be panic attacks as part of OCD. Given the frequency and description, I'll consider Panic Disorder, but with the trigger, it might be secondary to OCD. The vignette says \"when triggered by intrusive thoughts,\" so perhaps not unexpected, thus not panic disorder. Hmm, but she might still meet criteria if she has fear of future attacks or changes behavior. I need to check: for panic disorder, attacks can be expected or unexpected. Actually, in DSM-5, panic disorder requires recurrent unexpected panic attacks. Here, they are triggered, so expected. Therefore, it might not be panic disorder but rather panic attacks specifier under another disorder like OCD or anxiety disorder. So perhaps instead of panic disorder, I should consider Other Specified Anxiety Disorder or just note panic attacks as part of OCD. But the vignette specifies panic attacks, so maybe she has comorbid panic disorder. Let's see: she has attacks triggered by thoughts, but that could still be considered expected if the trigger is internal (thoughts). In panic disorder, attacks are often unexpected, but not always. The criteria say \"recurrent unexpected panic attacks,\" so if they are consistently triggered, they might not be considered unexpected. Therefore, I might not include panic disorder as a separate diagnosis. Instead, panic attacks could be part of OCD or generalized anxiety.\n\nAlternatively, given the social anxiety and panic attacks, it could be Generalized Anxiety Disorder, but the vignette doesn't mention excessive worry about various topics aside from health and intrusive thoughts.\n\n5. Secondary: Social Anxiety Disorder. She has distressing social anxiety in small groups, leading to significant avoidance. However, she says it's primary due to her unwanted thoughts rather than fear of being judged. Social Anxiety Disorder requires fear of negative evaluation, so if the anxiety is solely due to fear of her thoughts being revealed, it might not meet criteria. But she might still have social anxiety independent of that. The vignette says \"this anxiety is primary due to her unwanted\/intrusive thoughts rather than a fear of being judged.\" So it seems the social anxiety is a consequence of her OCD, not a separate fear of judgment. Therefore, it might not be a separate disorder. Instead, it could be part of OCD.\n\nOther considerations: Cannabis Use Disorder. She uses marijuana daily when available, which helps with intrusive thoughts but sometimes triggers anxiety. Daily use with functional impairment might indicate a use disorder, but the vignette doesn't specify negative consequences, so maybe not.\n\nAlso, history of anemia and IBS are medical, not psychiatric.\n\nSo, for the list:\n\nPrimary: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (F42.2, since with poor insight? Or standard F42.2? Actually, ICD-10 code for OCD is F42, but in DSM-5, it's coded as F42.2 for OCD). I'll use F42.2.\n\nSecondary: Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, moderate (since episodes are not completely debilitating but lasting two weeks with multiple symptoms). ICD-10 code F33.1 for recurrent depressive disorder, current episode moderate.\n\nSecondary: Illness Anxiety Disorder (F45.21). She has preoccupation with having a serious illness (cancer, HIV, STIs) and excessive research, which are compulsive behaviors similar to OCD but classified separately.\n\nSecondary: Panic Disorder? But as above, attacks might be expected, so perhaps not. Let's reconsider: she has panic attacks with physical symptoms, occurring 1-2 times monthly. They are triggered by intrusive thoughts, so they are expected. Therefore, panic disorder might not fit. Instead, it could be Anxiety Disorder Not Otherwise Specified or simply panic attacks as part of OCD. However, DSM-5 has Other Specified Anxiety Disorder for cases with panic attacks but not meeting full criteria for panic disorder. But given the vignette, she might have panic attacks as a feature of OCD. So maybe I shouldn't include a separate panic diagnosis.\n\nAlternatively, consider Generalized Anxiety Disorder. She has anxiety about health and intrusive thoughts, but not necessarily excessive worry about multiple areas. So probably not.\n\nSecondary: Social Anxiety Disorder? As above, it might be secondary to OCD, so not a separate disorder.\n\nAnother possibility: Posttraumatic Stress Disorder? No trauma mentioned.\n\nOr Adjustment Disorder? Not likely.\n\nGiven the high frequency of depressive episodes, maybe it's Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) with recurrent major depressive episodes. But she says \"over 50 depressive episodes,\" which is strange because dysthymia is more chronic low mood. Here, each episode lasts two weeks, so recurrent MDD seems appropriate.\n\nAlso, she has a history of anxiety, which could be Generalized Anxiety Disorder, but not specified.\n\nI think the top diagnoses are OCD, MDD, Illness Anxiety Disorder, and then perhaps Panic Disorder or Other Specified Anxiety Disorder. But to have five, I need to include others.\n\nPossible: Cannabis Use Disorder, if daily use causes impairment. The vignette doesn't specify negative effects, but daily use when available could indicate dependence. However, she uses it to cope with intrusive thoughts, which might be self-medication. I'll consider it as a secondary diagnosis.\n\nAlso, history of OCD, depression, anxiety, so these are already covered.\n\nLet's list:\n\n1. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder - F42.2\n2. Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent - F33.1 (assuming current episode)\n3. Illness Anxiety Disorder - F45.21\n4. Panic Disorder? But I'm unsure. Alternatively, Other Specified Anxiety Disorder for panic attacks? ICD-10 for panic disorder is F41.0. She has panic attacks triggered by thoughts, which might not be unexpected, so maybe F41.8 for other specified anxiety disorders. However, DSM-5 would code panic disorder as F41.0 if criteria met. Let's check criteria: for panic disorder, at least one attack has been followed by one month or more of persistent worry about additional attacks or maladaptive behavior change. Does she have that? The vignette doesn't say she worries about future attacks or changes behavior due to panic. She has attacks when triggered by thoughts, but no mention of inter-attack worry. So probably not panic disorder. Therefore, I might not include it.\n\nPerhaps Social Anxiety Disorder despite her statement. She has significant avoidance in small groups due to anxiety. Even if it's due to intrusive thoughts, she might still meet criteria if she fears negative evaluation related to her thoughts. But she explicitly says it's not due to fear of being judged, so probably not.\n\nAnother idea: the intrusive thoughts about harming children and brother could be part of OCD, but also related to harm OCD, which is a subtype.\n\nGiven the vignette, the primary is clearly OCD. The depressive episodes are significant. Health anxiety is separate. Panic attacks are present but might be part of OCD. Social anxiety is secondary to OCD.\n\nSo for the list, I'll go with:\n\n1. OCD\n2. MDD recurrent\n3. Illness Anxiety Disorder\n4. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder (for panic attacks) or Panic Disorder if we assume she meets criteria. But to be precise, the vignette doesn't provide enough to confirm panic disorder, so I'll use Other Specified Anxiety Disorder.\n5. Cannabis Use Disorder? She uses daily when available, which might indicate a mild use disorder. However, no negative consequences mentioned. But daily use is a red flag. I'll include it as a possible diagnosis.\n\nAlternatively, since she has a history of anxiety and depression, but those are already covered.\n\nI recall that in DSM-5, if panic attacks are part of another disorder like OCD, they don't require a separate diagnosis. So maybe not include panic disorder.\n\nSo final list:\n\n1. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder - F42.2\n2. Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent Episode - F33.1\n3. Illness Anxiety Disorder - F45.21\n4. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder (with panic attacks) - F41.8\n5. Cannabis Use Disorder, Mild - F12.10\n\nBut let's confirm ICD-10 codes: \n- OCD: F42\n- MDD recurrent: F33.1 for moderate episode? She said \"not completely debilitating,\" so moderate.\n- Illness Anxiety Disorder: F45.21\n- Other Specified Anxiety Disorder: F41.8 for other specified anxiety disorders\n- Cannabis Use Disorder: F12.10 for cannabis abuse, mild? Actually, in ICD-10, cannabis use disorder is coded under F12.1 for harmful use or F12.2 for dependence. Since she uses daily when available, it might be dependence, but not specified. I'll use F12.10 for cannabis abuse, unspecified.\n\nHowever, the vignette says \"using marijuana daily when available,\" which suggests regular use, and she finds it helpful for intrusive thoughts but sometimes triggers anxiety. This could indicate a use disorder if there are negative consequences, but not explicitly stated. So maybe I shouldn't include it. Instead, consider Social Anxiety Disorder, but as above, it's likely not separate.\n\nAnother possibility: the depressive episodes might be better classified as Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) given the high frequency. But she says each episode lasts at least two weeks, which fits MDD criteria. PDD requires depressed mood most of the day, more days than not, for at least two years. Here, she's 22, with history since 2019, so maybe. But the vignette says \"over 50 depressive episodes in the past year,\" which is inconsistent with PDD's chronic nature. So MDD recurrent seems appropriate.\n\nSo I'll stick with the above list.",

He lives with his biological parents and seven-year-old brother, with whom he has \"constant\" conflict including arguing, screaming, and hitting. Erik has a developmental history of severe temper tantrums prior to age 4, with behavioral challenges emerging in kindergarten and worsening in subsequent grades. His mother reports that her son engages in \"constant defiance\", experiences rapid mood changes, and demonstrates impulsive behavior, including occasional incidents of pulling knives (though never pointing them at anyone). Daily arguments at home frequently escalate to physical aggression, particularly with his mother and brother. Erik has expressed statements such as \"I wish I could go to sleep and never wake up\" and reports feeling depressed \"randomly\" a couple times per month since second or third grade, though he denies daily depressive symptoms or changes in sleep or appetite. Erik's behavioral difficulties have manifested in both home and school environments. In school, he has engaged in speaking out of turn, refusing to follow directions, agitating teachers, and having \"screaming matches\" with staff. Despite these challenges, Erik maintains high grades across subjects (with math being his most difficult class at a B), has several friends, and is described as a leader in social interactions. He has a Section 504 plan that allows for movement opportunities and frequent breaks when needed. In March 2019, Erik began taking 2mg of Guanfacine (extended release) for attention\/concentration deficits, which has helped reduce impulsivity and improve behavioral control, though aggressive and defiant behaviors have continued. His mother reports implementing a point system for rewards and consequences but notes limited effectiveness due to inconsistent expectations between parents. Formal assessment indicates that Erik demonstrates a pattern of emotional dysregulation, defiance, and aggressive behavior, with physical aggression occurring approximately every other day at home. Assessment also confirms prior symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, which are present across settings and contribute to emotional dysregulation and academic underperformance relative to ability.",

    "model_thoughts":"Hmm, this is a complex clinical case requiring careful analysis. The user wants a diagnosis based on DSM-5-TR criteria following specific formatting rules. Let me start by extracting key information from the vignette.\n\nErik is 10 years old with a history of severe temper tantrums before age 4, worsening behavioral issues in school, and constant defiance at home. He shows emotional dysregulation, impulsive behavior, and aggression toward family members. He also mentions occasional depressive thoughts but no daily symptoms. \n\nOkay, the primary issue seems to be disruptive behavior with emotional dysregulation. The chronic pattern of defiance, aggression, and temper outbursts across settings points toward Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD). That fits the criteria of severe recurrent temper outbursts and persistent irritable mood between outbursts. \n\nNext, the assessment notes inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity across settings, which improved with guanfacine. That strongly suggests ADHD, Combined Presentation. Oppositional Defiant Disorder is also evident given the defiant, argumentative behavior and conflict with authority figures. \n\nThe depressive statements and random low mood episodes might indicate Unspecified Depressive Disorder, though it doesn\u2019t meet full criteria for major depression. Intermittent Explosive Disorder is considered due to the verbal and physical aggression, but DMDD takes precedence here. \n\nWait, the user specified only psychiatric diagnoses with F-codes, so I\u2019ll exclude any non-psychiatric conditions. The formatting requires a primary diagnosis followed by four secondary ones. Let me double-check the ICD-10 codes for each. DMDD is F34.8, ADHD is F90.2, ODD is F91.3, depressive disorder is F32.9, and IED is F63.81. \n\nThe vignette doesn\u2019t mention psychosis, mania, or trauma-related symptoms, so disorders like bipolar or PTSD aren\u2019t supported. The aggression is better explained by DMDD and ODD. The depressive symptoms are sporadic, so unspecified depressive disorder fits better than persistent depressive disorder. \n\nI think the list is accurate based on the data. No need to overcomplicate\u2014just stick to the evident symptoms and DSM-5-TR criteria. The user didn\u2019t ask for reasoning, so I\u2019ll just output the diagnoses as specified.",

The patient reports that this behavior began at age 27 (late 2017) and involves involuntary staring at people he does not know well, with particular focus on the genitals\/breasts of all genders and ages, including children. He spends approximately six hours per day engaged in or thinking about this behavior, which he cannot control through willpower alone, though he can interrupt it by creating a physical barrier in his line of sight or wearing sunglasses. The patient initially denied but later acknowledged experiencing unwanted sexual thoughts regarding his sexual orientation. This behavior has significantly impaired his functioning, causing him to lose multiple jobs within the past year, avoid family gatherings, limit time in public, and experience relationship strain with his girlfriend of 12 years, with whom he has three children and now stays home while she works. The patient experiences moderate suicidal ideation, including thoughts that he would be better off dead, and reports feeling worthless and guilty, particularly about \"not providing for my children and for staring\". He describes his mood as \"iffy\" and notes increased irritability. While the patient endorsed panic attacks on assessment, follow-up questioning revealed these occur specifically when thinking excessively about his staring behaviors or unemployment, rather than occurring spontaneously. He also endorsed criteria for agoraphobia and social anxiety on screening, though these appear directly related to fears of being judged for his staring behavior.

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, I need to analyze this clinical vignette carefully. The patient is a 32-year-old Black American male with no prior psychiatric history, presenting with uncontrollable staring focused on breasts and genitals. This started at age 27 and involves about six hours daily. He can't control it through willpower but uses physical barriers or sunglasses to interrupt. \n\nHe's experiencing significant impairment - lost multiple jobs, avoids social situations, relationship strain with his long-term girlfriend. He has moderate suicidal ideation, feelings of worthlessness and guilt, irritability, and depressed mood. The panic attacks are situationally triggered by thoughts about his staring or unemployment, not spontaneous. There's mention of agoraphobia and social anxiety, but they seem secondary to the staring behavior. There's a history of witnessing a traumatic event but no clear PTSD symptoms. Medical history includes hypertension on Amlodipine.\n\nThe key is organizing this information. The core issue seems to be the intrusive, repetitive staring behavior that he can't control, causing distress and impairment. This sounds like an obsessive-compulsive spectrum issue. The staring isn't pleasurable - it's distressing and unwanted, which differentiates it from a paraphilic disorder. He tries to resist it and uses compensatory behaviors (barriers, sunglasses), which aligns with OCD.\n\nThe depressive symptoms are present but don't meet full criteria for major depressive disorder according to the vignette. The anxiety symptoms appear directly tied to the staring behavior. The social avoidance and agoraphobia seem like consequences rather than primary conditions. The panic attacks are situationally bound, not spontaneous, so not panic disorder.\n\nFor differential diagnosis: Primary likely Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder with primarily obsessional symptoms. Secondary could be Persistent Depressive Disorder (dysthymia) given the chronic depressive symptoms. Social Anxiety Disorder might be considered but seems secondary. Illness Anxiety Disorder or Body Dysmorphic Disorder don't fit. Adjustment Disorder could be possible but the symptoms are more chronic. The trauma history without PTSD symptoms rules out PTSD. No substance use mentioned. The sexual thoughts about orientation might suggest OCD themes rather than sexual disorder.\n\nNeed to check DSM-5-TR criteria for OCD: recurrent, persistent thoughts, urges, or images that are intrusive and unwanted (the staring impulses), attempts to ignore or suppress them (using barriers, sunglasses), causes distress, time-consuming. Yes, this fits. The content involves sexual themes but isn't paraphilic because it's ego-dystonic.\n\nFor coding: OCD would be F42.2 (primarily obsessional thoughts). Depressive symptoms could be F34.1 (persistent depressive disorder). Social anxiety might be F40.10 if significant. Agoraphobia could be F40.00 if separate. Adjustment disorder could be F43.21 with depressed mood. But need to prioritize based on clinical presentation. The panic attacks are situationally bound, so not panic disorder.\n\nFinal list: 1. OCD, 2. Persistent depressive disorder, 3. Social anxiety disorder, 4. Agoraphobia, 5. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood. But need to ensure agoraphobia isn't just part of social anxiety. The vignette says agoraphobia and social anxiety appear directly related to fears of being judged for staring, so they might be specifiers rather than separate. However, for differential, they should be considered.\n\nAlso, the trauma history without PTSD symptoms rules out PTSD but could be other specified trauma disorder. However, not enough data. Stick to what's clearly presented.",

He's brought in because his mother noticed him using a Clorox wipe on his skin. His cleaning behaviors started around the beginning of COVID in 2020, initially due to fear of catching the virus, but they've persisted and intensified over three years.\n\nHe shows excessive cleaning rituals: wiping down devices after outings, daily cleaning of doorknobs, light switches, and bathroom counters. He washes hands frequently, showers multiple times a day, and even used a disinfecting wipe on his body. He expresses an intense fear of contamination, believing the outside is \"dirty\" and his room must stay \"clean.\" Anything entering his room must be decontaminated to avoid contaminating the entire space. He experiences anxiety if he can't clean things properly. He also has repetitive behaviors, like restarting handwashing if he misses a spot or touches the sink. These rituals are time-consuming, interfering with schoolwork.\n\nNow, considering DSM-5-TR criteria, the primary issue seems to be obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The obsessions are contamination fears, and the compulsions are cleaning rituals. The behaviors cause significant distress and impairment in functioning (school struggles). The history of GAD is noted, but the current symptoms align more with OCD.\n\nFor differential diagnoses, Illness Anxiety Disorder might be considered, but here the fear is contamination leading to compulsive cleaning, not just worry about having an illness. Hoarding Disorder involves difficulty discarding items, not cleaning rituals. Social Anxiety Disorder could be a thought, but the anxiety here is contamination-based, not social scrutiny. Body Dysmorphic Disorder involves preoccupation with perceived flaws in appearance, which doesn't fit here. Panic Disorder involves sudden panic attacks, not described here. Trichotillomania or Excoriation Disorder involve hair-pulling or skin-picking, not relevant. Autism Spectrum Disorder sometimes includes rituals, but no other symptoms mentioned.

Also, the cleaning rituals could be part of OCD, but the fear of contamination and need for symmetry (restarting if not perfect) are classic OCD traits.

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the vignette. The patient is a 10-year-old female, ward of the state, with a history of being returned from foster and adoptive families due to anger and aggression. She\u2019s brought in for hitting kids at school. Teacher reported she slapped a classmate during an argument, and there have been many other reports of tantrums and fights this year.\n\nThe guardian mentions the patient is easily irritable, lacks accountability, blames others, and has aggressive outbursts multiple times a week. The patient interrupts during the assessment, calls the guardian a liar, and when told hospitalization might be necessary, she throws a tissue box at the glass divider. Afterward, she becomes tearful and apologetic, saying she didn\u2019t mean it. The guardian notes outbursts happen when she doesn\u2019t get her way but also mentions general irritability.\n\nFirst, I need to extract key symptoms and organize them. The main issues are recurrent behavioral outbursts, irritability, aggression towards peers, lack of remorse or accountability, and emotional dysregulation. The outbursts are disproportionate to the situation, happening multiple times a week, and are not premeditated. She shows rapid mood shifts during the assessment\u2014anger followed by tearfulness.\n\nConsidering DSM-5-TR criteria, the primary diagnosis seems to be Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD). DMDD requires severe recurrent temper outbursts and persistent irritable or angry mood between outbursts, present for at least 12 months. Here, she has tantrums, fights, irritability, and outbursts multiple times a week, which fits. Age of onset is before 10, and the symptoms are occurring in multiple settings (school and home\/foster care). She\u2019s 10, so within the 6-18 age range for DMDD.\n\nNext, Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) is a strong possibility. Symptoms include angry\/irritable mood, argumentative\/defiant behavior, and vindictiveness. She blames others, interrupts, calls the guardian a liar, and is easily annoyed. However, DMDD takes precedence if criteria are met because it\u2019s more severe. Since DMDD is characterized by severe temper outbursts and chronic irritability, it might be the primary here, but ODD should be considered as a differential or comorbid condition.\n\nIntermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) is another consideration. It involves recurrent behavioral outbursts representing a failure to control aggressive impulses. However, the outbursts here seem more related to irritability and temper rather than impulsive aggression. Also, IED requires outbursts that are grossly out of proportion to the provocation, which fits, but DMDD is more specific for children with persistent irritability.\n\nConduct Disorder (CD) might be relevant due to aggression towards others, but she doesn\u2019t show more severe behaviors like bullying, cruelty, or destruction of property. The aggression is mainly hitting peers and throwing objects, but without more severe conduct issues, CD might be less likely. However, given her history of being returned from families due to aggression, it\u2019s worth considering as a secondary diagnosis.\n\nAdjustment Disorder with disturbance of conduct could be possible given her unstable background, but the symptoms seem more chronic and pervasive rather than in response to a recent stressor. Her history includes multiple foster placements, so trauma-related issues like PTSD or Reactive Attachment Disorder might be relevant. She shows emotional dysregulation and aggression, which can be seen in trauma-related disorders, but the vignette doesn\u2019t specify traumatic events, so it\u2019s speculative.\n\nAlso, considering her age and presentation, ADHD might be comorbid, as impulsivity and emotional dysregulation are common. However, the vignette doesn\u2019t mention inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity outside of anger episodes, so it\u2019s less supported.\n\nNow, structuring the diagnoses: Primary should be DMDD due to chronic irritability and severe temper outbursts. Secondary could be ODD because of defiant behavior, blaming others, and irritability. Conduct Disorder, unspecified, given aggression towards others but without full criteria for more severe behaviors. Intermittent Explosive Disorder as another possibility for impulsive aggression. Lastly, Adjustment Disorder with disturbance of conduct considering her unstable care history, though the chronicity might lean more towards DMDD.\n\nWait, the rubric says to output only the structured list without reasoning. So I\u2019ll list them in order of likelihood based on the vignette. Let me double-check the F-codes: DMDD is F34.81, ODD is F91.3, Conduct Disorder unspecified is F91.9, IED is F63.81, Adjustment Disorder with disturbance of conduct is F43.24.\n\nBut I need to ensure these are the top 5 most likely. Perhaps Reactive Attachment Disorder could be considered, but without clear evidence of neglect or abuse, it\u2019s less certain. The vignette mentions parents unfit, so possible neglect, but not specified. So sticking with the above.\n\nFinal list should be: DMDD primary, then ODD, Conduct Disorder, IED, and Adjustment Disorder. Let me confirm the symptoms match each. DMDD: chronic irritability, severe temper outbursts multiple times a week. ODD: angry mood, argumentative, defiant. Conduct Disorder: aggression to others, rule violations. IED: impulsive aggression disproportionate to stressor. Adjustment Disorder: behavioral disturbance in response to stressors (family instability). Yes, that seems comprehensive.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the clinical vignette provided. The patient is a 15-year-old male brought in by his grandmother due to irritability and anger. The symptoms have been present for the past few months, which gives a timeline. He's isolating himself, lashing out when asked to join family, and spending less time with friends. His grades have dropped, and he expresses feelings of worthlessness, calling school \"stupid and pointless\" and believing he won't amount to anything. He appears tired, naps more due to boredom, and has lost interest in activities he used to enjoy, like video games. The grandmother notes this is a change from his previous behavior, describing him as formerly bright and social.\n\nFirst, I need to extract all relevant clinical data. Key symptoms include irritability, social withdrawal, anhedonia (loss of interest in games and socializing), fatigue, increased sleep, decreased academic performance, and hopelessness. The duration is several months, which suggests a persistent issue rather than a transient reaction. There's no mention of substance use, trauma, medical issues, or psychotic symptoms like hallucinations or delusions. The grandmother's report adds collateral information, confirming a significant change from baseline.\n\nNext, organizing this information logically. The core symptoms cluster around mood and behavioral changes: depressed mood (indirectly shown through irritability and hopelessness), anhedonia, fatigue, and social withdrawal. The timeline indicates a persistent state, ruling out acute stress or brief episodes. The absence of manic symptoms, psychosis, or substance use helps narrow down the differential.\n\nNow, considering DSM-5-TR criteria. The primary concern is a mood disorder. Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) fits well: depressed mood (irritability in adolescents can substitute for sad mood), anhedonia, fatigue, worthlessness, and impaired functioning for over two weeks. The duration here is months, so it meets the timeframe. However, I should consider other possibilities.\n\nPersistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) is a possibility due to the chronic nature, but the grandmother says he's never acted like this before, suggesting a more acute onset relative to his baseline, which leans toward MDD. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood could be considered if there's a stressor, but none is mentioned. The vignette doesn't specify any triggering event, so it's less likely.\n\nCould this be a disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD)? The patient is 15, and DMDD requires onset before age 10, so that rules it out. Also, the irritability here seems part of a broader depressive picture rather than severe recurrent temper outbursts.\n\nWhat about bipolar disorder? No signs of mania or hypomania, so unlikely. Schizophrenia spectrum? No psychotic symptoms, and the age is a bit young for typical onset, though not impossible. But without positive symptoms like hallucinations or delusions, it's lower on the list.\n\nSubstance-induced mood disorder isn't indicated as there's no mention of drug use. Medical conditions causing depressive symptoms aren't discussed, so while they should be ruled out clinically, the vignette doesn't provide data to support them.\n\nOther secondary diagnoses could include Other Specified Depressive Disorder if some criteria aren't fully met, but MDD seems appropriate. Also, considering the social withdrawal and irritability, Social Anxiety Disorder or another anxiety disorder might be possible, but the core symptoms align more with depression. However, anxiety can co-occur, so it's worth listing as a secondary possibility.\n\nThe patient's drop in grades and disinterest in school might suggest a specific learning disorder or ADHD, but there's no prior history or symptoms like inattention or hyperactivity mentioned. The grandmother says he was bright and social before, so academic decline seems secondary to mood issues.\n\nPersonality disorders are less likely at this age due to developmental considerations, though traits could emerge. But without persistent patterns beyond the current episode, it's not a primary concern.\n\nPutting it all together, the primary diagnosis is Major Depressive Disorder, single episode or recurrent? The vignette doesn't specify past episodes, so single episode is assumed. ICD-10 code F32.9 for depressive episode, unspecified.\n\nSecondary diagnoses: Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) is less likely but possible if the symptoms have been present longer than noted. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood if an undisclosed stressor exists. Other Specified Depressive Disorder for subthreshold symptoms, though MDD criteria seem met. Anxiety disorders like Social Anxiety Disorder given the withdrawal, but the anhedonia and irritability point more to depression. Let's prioritize based on likelihood.\n\nSo, the list: \n1. Major Depressive Disorder - F32.9\n2. Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) - F34.1\n3. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood - F43.21\n4. Other Specified Depressive Disorder - F32.89\n5. Social Anxiety Disorder - F40.10\n\nBut wait, should I include Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder? No, because the age criterion isn't met. Also, no mention of severe temper outbursts. So, that's ruled out.\n\nAnother thought: the irritability and anger could suggest Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), but the symptoms seem embedded within a depressive episode rather than a persistent pattern of anger and defiance outside of mood episodes. The grandmother describes a change from baseline, so ODD is less likely as it typically develops earlier and is more chronic.\n\nFinally, ensuring the response format is correct: only the structured list with diagnoses and F-codes, no clinical reasoning. So, I'll output that directly.",

Her friends provide her support during the difficult time and bring her food and clean her house for her. She has been feeling guilty for ignoring mom while she was going through the depression. She should have been more supportive of her and maybe could have saved her mom. This has been making her feel it was all her fault and that she should be dead too and not live anymore but does not have a plan or an intention to die. She reports having trouble sleeping at night, sleeping approximately 2-3 hours every night, going out for a walk when not sleeping. She has been engaging in increased promiscuous behaviors like having one-night stands with the people she meets on the walks. She reports her energy is okay the next day and has not slept in for about a month. She denied any past medical problems and denied any substance use.

The promiscuous behavior and sleep disturbances are notable\u2014they could indicate hypomanic features, but given the context, they're more likely trauma-driven dysregulation.\n\nPersistent complex bereavement disorder fits well due to the prolonged grief reaction with functional impairment. The history of sexual abuse adds another layer, potentially explaining some of the behavioral patterns. Adjustment disorder is a possibility but seems less specific given the severity and duration. Substance use was denied, so that's ruled out.\n\nThe key is recognizing that while depressive symptoms are prominent, they're embedded in a trauma and grief context.

The rubric emphasizes expert-level data extraction and diagnostic reasoning, but the instructions specifically state not to output any clinical reasoning\u2014just the list of diagnoses with ICD-10 codes. \n\nFirst, I need to extract all relevant symptoms from the vignette. The patient is a 19-year-old female with a 3-month history of increased anxiety since starting university. Key features include persistent anxiety about academic performance and social interactions, physical symptoms like tachycardia, sweating, and nausea, situational triggers like being called on in class or presentations, and panic attacks without fear of dying. She also reports obsessive thoughts about \"doing better\" and compulsive studying but denies intrusive thoughts. Symptoms are context-dependent, improving when she returns home. No prior psychiatric history or substance use.\n\nFor the primary diagnosis, Social Anxiety Disorder seems most fitting given the fear of negative evaluation in social\/academic situations, avoidance, and functional impairment. The panic attacks appear situational, not unexpected, so Panic Disorder is less likely. \n\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder is a strong contender due to persistent worry about multiple domains (academics, socializing), but the social component seems more prominent. Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety is possible given the onset coinciding with university transition, but the severity and specific symptom pattern lean toward a primary anxiety disorder. \n\nThe obsessive-compulsive symptoms are limited to academic perfectionism without true obsessions or compulsions, so OCD isn\u2019t met. Avoidant Personality Disorder could be considered given the social inhibition and fear of criticism, but the vignette doesn\u2019t provide enough personality traits for a confident diagnosis. \n\nICD-10 codes need to align with DSM-5-TR equivalents. Social Anxiety Disorder is F40.10, GAD is F41.1, Panic Disorder is F41.0, Adjustment Disorder is F43.23, and Avoidant Personality Disorder is F60.6.

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the clinical vignette. The patient is a 16-year-old male with a past psychiatric history of DMDD and ODD. He assaulted his mother after she told him to clean his room and tried to take away his video game. He punched her in the head and called her a derogatory name. There's a history of truancy, pending charges for assaulting another student since age 14, and collateral history from the mother about sexual abuse by his biological father. The mother describes irritability, explosive behavior since age 9, arguing with authority figures, skipping school, running away, siblings fearing him, and cruelty to the family dog. UDS is positive for marijuana, which he admits to using daily for a year.\n\nFirst, I need to extract and organize the key information. The patient has a history of disruptive behavior disorders (DMDD and ODD) but the current presentation includes severe aggression, impulsivity, callousness, cruelty to animals, disregard for rules, and legal issues. The age of onset for behavioral issues is around 9, but the more severe conduct problems like assault and cruelty to animals are prominent. The marijuana use is daily, which could complicate things, but the behavioral issues predate the substance use based on the timeline provided.\n\nNow, thinking about diagnostic reasoning. The past diagnoses were DMDD and ODD, but at 16, some features might have evolved. The cruelty to animals, aggression towards people, violation of rules (truancy, running away), and lack of remorse (calling his mother a bitch) point towards Conduct Disorder. The history of sexual abuse is a significant risk factor. Oppositional Defiant Disorder is still relevant given the arguing and defiance, but Conduct Disorder takes precedence due to the severity. Also, the irritability and explosive anger could be part of DMDD, but DMDD is typically diagnosed in children up to age 18, so it might still be applicable. However, the callous and unemotional traits (hitting the dog, lack of empathy) might indicate a specifier for Conduct Disorder.\n\nSubstance use is present with daily marijuana use, so Cannabis Use Disorder is likely. The trauma history from sexual abuse might suggest PTSD, but the vignette doesn't mention specific PTSD symptoms like flashbacks, nightmares, or avoidance related to the trauma. The irritability and aggression could be trauma-related, but without clear PTSD criteria, it might be a rule-out rather than a primary diagnosis.\n\nConsidering the differential: Conduct Disorder is top due to the pattern of violating others' rights and societal norms. ODD is still there as a precursor or comorbid condition. DMDD might be comorbid given the chronic irritability and temper outbursts. Cannabis Use Disorder is evident from daily use and positive UDS. The fifth could be PTSD given the trauma history, but the symptoms aren't explicitly described, so it might be lower on the list. Alternatively, Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder could be considered if the irritability is prominent between outbursts.\n\nWait, the patient is 16, and DMDD can be diagnosed up to age 18, but Conduct Disorder often co-occurs. The aggression towards people and animals, destruction of property (not explicitly mentioned but implied by hitting the dog and assault), deceitfulness (maybe truancy?), and serious violations of rules (truancy, running away) fit Conduct Disorder. The specifier \"with limited prosocial emotions\" might apply given the callousness.\n\nSo, the primary diagnosis should be Conduct Disorder. Secondary diagnoses could include ODD, DMDD, Cannabis Use Disorder, and possibly PTSD or another trauma-related disorder. However, the vignette doesn't provide enough for PTSD criteria, so maybe Unspecified Trauma-Related Disorder? But the instruction is to use DSM-5-TR diagnoses with F-codes, so sticking to what's supported.\n\nLet me list them in order of priority based on the presentation: Conduct Disorder as primary, then ODD, DMDD, Cannabis Use Disorder, and given the trauma history, Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder if PTSD criteria aren't fully met, or Adjustment Disorder? But the trauma was in childhood, and the behavioral issues are chronic, so perhaps PTSD is still possible. However, the mother didn't mention PTSD symptoms, so it's less likely.\n\nAlternatively, since the patient has a history of sexual abuse and exhibits aggression, PTSD with dysphoric mood or behavioral disturbances could be considered. But without clear re-experiencing or avoidance, it's speculative. Maybe list it as a rule-out, but the instruction is top 5 diagnoses.\n\nSo, finalizing: Conduct Disorder (primary), ODD, DMDD, Cannabis Use Disorder, and given the trauma, Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder (for significant trauma history with behavioral symptoms not meeting full PTSD criteria). Or should I include Intermittent Explosive Disorder? But the aggression is part of Conduct Disorder and DMDD, so not separate.\n\nThus, the list is:\n1. Conduct Disorder - F91.2\n2. Oppositional Defiant Disorder - F91.3\n3. Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder - F34.81\n4. Cannabis Use Disorder - F12.20\n5. Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder - F43.8\n\nWait, the patient is 16, and DMDD is diagnosed from 6 to 18, so it's applicable. ODD is often a precursor to Conduct Disorder. Cannabis Use Disorder is clear. The trauma-related disorder is listed last due to limited symptoms but significant history.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me break down what the user is asking. They want me to act as an expert psychiatrist and diagnose based on a clinical vignette following the DSM-5-TR criteria. The user provided a detailed rubric for clinical reasoning, but the response should only list diagnoses with ICD-10 codes without any reasoning. \n\nFirst, I need to extract key details from the vignette. The patient is a 25-year-old female with a history of anxiety and depression. She reports a current depressive episode lasting 3 weeks with symptoms like anhedonia, low energy, guilt, etc. But there's also a mention of a prior period where she felt extremely happy, energetic, and needed little sleep for about 5 days. That sounds like a hypomanic episode. \n\nConsidering the timeline: she had a hypomanic episode about a month ago, followed by a depressive episode now. The past reaction to Zoloft causing feeling \"hyper\" is a red flag for bipolar disorder. So the primary diagnosis should likely be Bipolar II Disorder, given the hypomanic episode and current major depressive episode. \n\nFor secondary diagnoses, her history includes anxiety and depression. Persistent Depressive Disorder could be considered if the depressive symptoms were chronic before, but the vignette says she felt \"normal\" prior to the 3 weeks. However, past history might indicate recurrent episodes. Anxiety disorder unspecified could fit her past anxiety history. Adjustment disorder might be less likely given the clear mood episodes. Also, rule out cyclothymia, but the episodes here seem more distinct. \n\nMake sure to list only DSM-5-TR diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes. Prioritize Bipolar II as primary, then other mood and anxiety disorders based on the history. Avoid including non-psychiatric diagnoses or adding reasoning in the final answer.",

The patient was reportedly at a gas station causing a disturbance, speaking about how everyone in there was the devil and throwing items off the shelves. When officers arrived, the patient was aggressive and had to be tased. On arrival, the patient had to receive emergency IM medications of Haldol, Ativan, and Benadryl due to agitation.

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the clinical vignette to extract all relevant details. The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of hypertension, substance use disorder (marijuana, methamphetamine), and psychosis. He was brought to the ED by police after causing a disturbance at a gas station, where he was aggressive, spoke about others being the devil, and threw items. Police had to taser him. In the ED, he received emergency IM medications (Haldol, Ativan, Benadryl) for agitation. Psychiatry noted drowsiness post-medication but also irritability, hostility, grandiose delusions (claiming to be God), and persecutory delusions (devil out to get others). He has a history of antipsychotic prescriptions but is currently non-adherent. UDS is positive for marijuana, methamphetamine, and PCP. Started on low-dose Risperidone. Next day, he's less hostile but irritable and sleepy. Denies previous delusions, doesn't recall the gas station incident, admits to using substances for two days straight, is homeless, and denies SI\/HI or hallucinations upon reassessment. Discharged after 24 hours.\n\nFirst, I need to organize the key symptoms and timeline. Acute presentation with aggression, disorganized behavior (throwing items), delusions (grandiose and persecutory), and irritability. These occurred in the context of acute substance use (UDS positive for multiple substances). Symptoms improved rapidly within 24 hours after medication and without further substance use. History of prior psychosis and substance use disorder, but current non-adherence to antipsychotics. Homelessness is a psychosocial stressor.\n\nNow, considering diagnostic reasoning. The core issue is acute psychosis with aggression. Differential diagnosis should prioritize substance-induced disorders given the positive UDS and acute onset. Substance\/medication-induced psychotic disorder is likely because symptoms emerged during intoxication (PCP, methamphetamine) and improved quickly after the substances were metabolized. Also, the patient admits to using these substances for two days straight, which aligns with the timeline.\n\nNext, primary psychotic disorders like schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder are possible given the history of psychosis and antipsychotic prescriptions. However, the rapid resolution of symptoms after substance use cessation and medication makes a substance-induced etiology more probable. The patient's homelessness and lack of medication adherence complicate the picture, but the acute presentation tied to substance use leans towards substance-induced.\n\nOther considerations include bipolar disorder with psychotic features due to grandiose delusions and irritability, but the absence of mood episode history and the direct link to substance use reduce this likelihood. Delirium is possible given drowsiness and confusion, but the focus on psychotic symptoms and rapid improvement point away from a general medical condition like delirium. The patient's hypertension is noted but not directly contributing to the psychiatric symptoms.\n\nThe top diagnosis should be substance-induced psychotic disorder because the psychotic symptoms are temporally related to substance intoxication and resolve quickly. The specific substances involved are PCP and methamphetamine, both known to cause psychosis. The history of prior psychosis might indicate a dual diagnosis, but the acute episode is best explained by substance use.\n\nSecondary diagnoses should include the underlying substance use disorders for each positive UDS finding: methamphetamine use disorder, PCP use disorder, and cannabis use disorder. Also, consider other psychotic disorders as rule-outs due to the history of psychosis, but prioritize substance-induced given the current presentation. Avoid non-psychiatric diagnoses as per instructions.\n\nSo, the structured list: primary diagnosis is substance-induced psychotic disorder, followed by substance use disorders for each substance. Since there are multiple substances, I'll list them separately. The history of psychosis might warrant a diagnosis of unspecified schizophrenia spectrum disorder or other psychotic disorder, but the vignette doesn't provide enough detail for a specific primary psychotic diagnosis. However, given the prior history, it should be included as a secondary diagnosis.\n\nWait, the patient has a past psychiatric history of psychosis, but the current episode is substance-induced. So, the primary is substance-induced psychotic disorder due to multiple substances (methamphetamine and PCP). Then, methamphetamine use disorder, PCP use disorder, cannabis use disorder, and given the history, other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder (for the past psychosis) or unspecified if details are lacking. The vignette doesn't specify if the past psychosis was independent of substances, but since he has a history of antipsychotic prescriptions, it's plausible he has a co-occurring psychotic disorder.\n\nTherefore, the list: 1. Substance-induced psychotic disorder, 2. Methamphetamine use disorder, 3. Phencyclidine use disorder, 4. Cannabis use disorder, 5. Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder (or unspecified if details are insufficient). I need to assign F-codes accordingly.\n\nCheck DSM-5-TR codes: Substance-induced psychotic disorder code depends on the substance. For methamphetamine-induced psychotic disorder, it's F15.159 (if with hallucinations) or F15.959 (without). The vignette mentions delusions but not ongoing hallucinations after stabilization. Since the patient later denies hallucinations, use without perceptual disturbances. However, the initial presentation included delusions, so F15.959 might apply. Similarly, PCP-induced psychotic disorder is F16.959. Since both substances were involved, the appropriate code might be for multiple substances, but DSM-5 allows specifying each. For simplicity, use the predominant substance or code for multiple. The vignette doesn't specify which substance is primary, so I'll use methamphetamine as it's commonly associated with psychosis. Alternatively, use \"other substance-induced psychotic disorder\" if multiple substances are involved. But to be precise, since the UDS was positive for both, and the patient used both, I'll choose one based on severity. Methamphetamine is more likely to cause aggressive behavior and psychosis, so F15.959. However, PCP is also strongly associated with psychosis. I recall that DSM-5 allows coding for specific substances. Since both are present, perhaps list the substance-induced disorder due to the most likely culprit, but the instruction says top 5 diagnoses, so I can list both substance use disorders separately.\n\nWait, the primary diagnosis should be one entity. So, I'll use substance-induced psychotic disorder due to multiple substances. The ICD-10 code for other substance-induced psychotic disorder is F19.959 if without perceptual disturbances. That might be appropriate here because multiple substances are involved. Yes, that fits better.\n\nFor substance use disorders: methamphetamine use disorder is F15.20 (unspecified severity), PCP use disorder is F16.20, cannabis use disorder is F12.20. The past psychosis history: since details are limited, other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder is F28, or unspecified psychotic disorder is F29. I'll use F29 for brevity as the exact specification isn't provided.\n\nSo, the final list: 1. Other (or multiple) substance-induced psychotic disorder, without perceptual disturbances - F19.959; 2. Methamphetamine use disorder, unspecified - F15.20; 3. Phencyclidine use disorder, unspecified - F16.20; 4. Cannabis use disorder, unspecified - F12.20; 5. Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder - F29.\n\nMake sure the primary diagnosis is the substance-induced psychotic disorder as it best explains the acute presentation. The secondary diagnoses include the substance use disorders and the historical psychotic disorder. This covers all key aspects without fabricating details.",

She still enjoys activities and denies anhedonia or suicidal ideation, which rules out major depressive disorder as the primary issue. The panic attack appears situational, linked to memories of the trauma. \n\nThe constricted affect and tearfulness when discussing the cat, contrasted with cheerfulness in other contexts, suggest a trauma-related disorder rather than a mood disorder.

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the clinical vignette. The patient is a 20-year-old African American male with no prior psychiatric history. He presented with a one-week history of abnormal behavior, depressed mood, and headaches after testing positive for COVID-19 a month earlier. His symptoms started with anxiety, insomnia, depressed mood, and headache, then rapidly progressed to auditory hallucinations, paranoia, and functional impairment.\n\nHmm, the progression here is important. Initial psychiatric symptoms followed by neurological signs like fever, arm twitching, and mutism. The fact that antipsychotics and other meds were ineffective is a key point. Also, the EEG showed encephalopathy without seizures, and autoimmune encephalitis was considered but not confirmed.\n\nThe partial response to benzodiazepines and gradual improvement leading to full recovery within a month stands out. The timeline is acute onset post-COVID, with both psychiatric and neurological symptoms, but full recovery eventually.\n\nConsidering DSM-5-TR, the primary issue seems to be a psychotic episode with mood symptoms, but the neurological signs and post-infectious context complicate it. Since autoimmune encephalitis wasn't confirmed, but the symptoms align with an organic cause, maybe a psychotic disorder due to another medical condition fits best. The medical condition here could be the COVID-19 infection leading to encephalopathy or other CNS effects.\n\nOther possibilities include brief psychotic disorder because of the acute onset and full recovery, but the neurological symptoms and lack of response to antipsychotics suggest an organic etiology. Schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder are less likely given no prior history and full recovery. Mood disorders with psychotic features might be considered, but the neurological signs point away from a primary psychiatric disorder.\n\nWait, the vignette mentions partial response to benzodiazepines, which isn't typical for primary psychotic disorders. Also, the mutism, immobility, and fever suggest catatonia, which can be due to various causes, including medical conditions. So, catatonic disorder due to another medical condition might be a secondary diagnosis.\n\nLet me list the top differentials. Primary: Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition (COVID-19 related encephalopathy). Secondary: Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition, brief psychotic disorder (though less likely due to medical signs), unspecified depressive disorder with psychotic features (since depressed mood was present initially), and other specified schizophrenia spectrum disorder as a broader category if the organic cause isn't fully established.\n\nNeed to ensure ICD-10 F-codes are accurate. For psychotic disorder due to another medical condition, it's F06.2. Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition is F06.1. Brief psychotic disorder is F23. Depressive disorder with psychotic features could be F32.3 or F33.3, but since it's unspecified, maybe F32.9 or F33.9? Wait, the vignette mentions depressed mood, so major depressive disorder with psychotic features might be F32.3. However, the primary issue seems psychotic, so maybe other specified schizophrenia spectrum disorder (F28) as a secondary.\n\nLet me structure the list. The patient had both psychotic and catatonic features with a medical trigger, so primary should be the psychotic disorder due to another medical condition. Then catatonia due to another medical condition, brief psychotic disorder (though recovery was within a month, which fits), depressive disorder with psychotic features, and other specified schizophrenia spectrum disorder as a catch-all.\n\nWait, the vignette says full recovery within a month after transfer, so brief psychotic disorder might be higher up, but the neurological signs and lack of response to antipsychotics push it down. Also, the catatonic symptoms were prominent, so that's important.\n\nAlright, finalizing: 1. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition (F06.2). 2. Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition (F06.1). 3. Brief psychotic disorder (F23). 4. Major depressive disorder with psychotic features (F32.3). 5. Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder (F28). \n\nMake sure the order reflects likelihood based on the vignette. The medical condition link is strong due to post-COVID onset and neurological signs, so that's primary. Catatonia is a key feature, so secondary. Brief psychotic disorder is possible but less likely due to medical involvement. Depressive features were present initially, so that's included. Finally, an unspecified psychotic disorder as a broader category.",

Catatonia symptoms: stupor, mannerism, and negativism. It's important to treat catatonia and hence the diagnosis of catatonia should be made along with depression.",
    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the vignette. The patient is a 16-year-old Asian male with no prior psychiatric history, brought in due to concerns from the school nurse about dizziness, low blood pressure, and significant weight loss. He's been feeling overwhelmed and depressed for 6-8 months. There's a CPS report for neglect, revealing poor nutrition. He has orthostatic hypotension likely from malnutrition. During evaluation, he appears dysphoric, downcast eyes, thought blocking, constricted affect, avoids eye contact. He admits to recurrent death thoughts and having a plan but won't disclose it. Family noticed withdrawal, tiredness, lack of appetite, weight loss. History of bullying. Then after admission, he deteriorates: stops speaking, refuses to move or eat, doesn't follow directions, staring, unusual mannerisms.\n\nFirst, I need to extract key symptoms and organize them. The timeline is important: symptoms for 6-8 months, recent deterioration. Core symptoms include depressed mood, anhedonia (withdrawal, tiredness), weight loss, suicidal ideation with plan. Then there's the deterioration into mutism, negativism (refusing to move\/eat), staring, unusual mannerisms\u2014this sounds like catatonia. Also, thought blocking noted earlier, which might be a cognitive symptom or related to depression or psychosis.\n\nNow, considering differential diagnoses. The primary issue seems to be a severe depressive episode with suicidal ideation, which fits Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, severe with catatonic features. But wait, the catatonic features emerged later, so it could be MDD with catatonia. However, the unusual mannerisms might suggest psychosis, but no clear hallucinations or delusions are mentioned. Could it be schizophrenia? But the duration is less than 6 months of psychotic symptoms? He's had depressed mood for 6-8 months, but the catatonia and mannerisms are recent. Schizophrenia requires at least 6 months of symptoms including prodromal or active phase. Here, the prodromal symptoms might be the depression and withdrawal, but the active psychosis isn't clearly stated. The mannerisms might be disorganized behavior, but without other psychotic symptoms, it's less clear.\n\nAnother possibility is Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood, but given the severity and duration, MDD is more likely. Also, the malnutrition and weight loss could indicate an eating disorder, but no body image disturbance or fear of weight gain is mentioned. The weight loss seems secondary to loss of appetite from depression.\n\nThe catatonia is prominent. Catatonia can be due to various conditions, including mood disorders, psychotic disorders, or medical conditions. Here, the malnutrition might contribute, but the psychiatric symptoms predate that. So, Catatonia associated with another mental disorder (depression) should be considered.\n\nAlso, given the abrupt deterioration and refusal to eat\/drink, there's a risk of dehydration or medical issues, but the task is psychiatric diagnoses only.\n\nWhat about PTSD? There's a history of bullying, which could be a trauma, but no clear re-experiencing, avoidance of trauma-related stimuli, or hyperarousal mentioned. So, less likely.\n\nAnxiety disorders? He's overwhelmed by school pressure, but no specific anxiety symptoms detailed.\n\nSubstance use? Not mentioned.\n\nSo, top diagnoses: \n1. Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, severe with catatonic features. \nBut catatonia might be a separate specifier or even a separate diagnosis if it's the predominant feature. According to DSM-5, catatonia can be specified as a specifier for depressive disorders, or as a separate diagnosis if it's due to another medical condition or unspecified. Here, it's likely due to the depressive disorder.\n\nAlternatively, given the unusual mannerisms and possible disorganization, could it be Schizophreniaform Disorder or Brief Psychotic Disorder? But the duration of psychotic symptoms isn't clear. The mannerisms might be part of catatonia rather than psychosis.\n\nAnother thought: the patient is Asian, and there might be cultural factors affecting presentation, but no specific details given.\n\nAlso, the refusal to speak could be selective mutism, but given the context, it's likely part of catatonia or severe depression.\n\nSo, structuring the list:\nPrimary: Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, severe with catatonic features. ICD-10: F32.2 (severe depressive episode without psychotic symptoms) or F32.3 (with psychotic symptoms)? But no clear psychosis mentioned, so F32.2. But catatonic features are included under specifiers, so F32.2 with catatonia.\n\nActually, in ICD-10, catatonic schizophrenia is F20.2, but here it's not schizophrenia. For depressive episode with catatonic features, it's still F32.2 or F32.3 depending on severity and presence of psychosis. Since no psychosis, F32.2.\n\nBut wait, the patient admitted to death thoughts and plan, which is suicidal ideation, so severe without psychosis.\n\nSecondary diagnoses:\n- Catatonia: In DSM-5, catatonia can be a separate diagnosis if it's the predominant feature and not better explained by another disorder. Here, it's likely part of MDD, but given its prominence, listing it separately might be appropriate. However, the instruction is for DSM-5-TR diagnoses, and catatonia can be coded as F06.1 (catatonic disorder due to known physiological condition) or F06.1? Actually, in ICD-10, catatonia is often part of other disorders. For unspecified catatonia, it's F06.1? Let me check: ICD-10 has F06.1 for organic catatonic disorder, and F20.2 for catatonic schizophrenia, but for mood disorders with catatonic features, it's under the mood disorder code. So probably not separate.\n\nBut the vignette says \"unusual mannerisms\" which might be disorganized behavior, so perhaps schizophrenia spectrum. However, without clear delusions or hallucinations, it's less likely.\n\nAnother possibility: Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) due to the malnutrition and weight loss without body image issues. But the loss of appetite seems related to depression, so not primary.\n\nAlso, Social Anxiety Disorder? Avoidance of eye contact, withdrawal, but likely secondary to depression.\n\nGiven the deterioration and catatonia, perhaps Schizophreniaform Disorder? But duration less than 6 months of psychotic symptoms. The depression has been 6-8 months, but the catatonia and mannerisms are recent, so within a month? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, Brief Psychotic Disorder with marked stressor (school pressure, bullying). But the duration of psychotic symptoms isn't specified, and catatonia can occur in brief psychotic disorder.\n\nPrioritizing: \n1. Major Depressive Disorder with catatonic features - F32.2\n2. Catatonia (as a separate diagnosis if needed) - but in ICD-10, for catatonia not otherwise specified, it's F06.1? Actually, DSM-5 has catatonia other specified or unspecified, which corresponds to F06.1 in ICD-10 for other catatonic disorders. But since it's associated with MDD, it might be redundant.\n\nPerhaps list: \n1. Major Depressive Disorder, severe with catatonic features - F32.2\n2. Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder (if catatonia is considered psychotic) - but no.\n\nWait, the patient has thought blocking, which could be a formal thought disorder, suggesting psychosis. But in depression, thought blocking can occur. Unusual mannerisms might be disorganized behavior.\n\nGiven the rapid deterioration and catatonia, another possibility is Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder, but no substance use mentioned.\n\nOr Medical condition causing symptoms, but not specified.\n\nSo, top 5:\n1. Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, severe with catatonic features - F32.2\n2. Schizophreniaform Disorder (if psychotic symptoms are present) - F20.81 (in ICD-10, schizophreniaform is F20.81 under other schizophrenia spectrum). But duration less than 6 months? The depression is 6-8 months, but psychotic features recent, so schizophreniaform possible.\n3. Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder - F50.8 (since weight loss due to apparent lack of interest in eating, not body image)\n4. Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood - F43.21 (given school stress and bullying)\n5. Social Anxiety Disorder - F40.10 (due to avoidance, withdrawal, bullying history)\n\nBut need to base only on info given. The eating issue seems secondary to depression, so ARFID less likely. Adjustment disorder is plausible but MDD is more severe and chronic. Social anxiety possible but not primary.\n\nAlternatively, consider PTSD - F43.10, but no clear trauma symptoms.\n\nGiven the catatonia, perhaps list catatonia as a separate diagnosis: F06.1 Catatonic disorder not otherwise specified.\n\nBut in DSM-5, catatonia can be diagnosed as Catatonia Not Otherwise Specified (F06.1) if it's the predominant clinical picture and not due to another mental disorder. However, here it's likely due to MDD, so specifier is sufficient.\n\nPerhaps for secondary diagnoses, consider:\n2. Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder - F50.8 (for significant weight loss without full criteria for anorexia)\n3. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder - F41.8 (for school-related anxiety)\n4. Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder - F43.8 (for bullying-related stress)\n5. Selective Mutism - F94.0 (since he stopped speaking, but it's part of catatonia)\n\nSelective mutism is usually in children, and here it's acute onset, so less likely.\n\nGiven the instruction for top 5 most likely, I should prioritize based on severity and relevance.\n\nSo:\n1. Major Depressive Disorder, severe with catatonic features - F32.2\n2. Catatonia (as a separate diagnosis due to its prominence) - F06.1\n3. Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder - F50.8\n4. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood - F43.21\n5. Social Anxiety Disorder - F40.10\n\nBut Catatonia might be redundant with MDD specifier. In DSM-5, if catatonia is present and is due to another mental disorder, we code the mental disorder with catatonia specifier, not a separate catatonia diagnosis. However, if catatonia is the predominant feature and the underlying disorder is unclear, we might code catatonia separately. Here, MDD is clear, so catatonia is a specifier.\n\nTherefore, for primary, it's MDD with catatonia. For secondary, consider other conditions.\n\nPerhaps:\n2. Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder - F28 (for psychotic features not meeting full criteria, if mannerisms are psychotic)\n3. Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder - F50.8\n4. Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood - F43.23\n5. Selective Mutism - F94.0\n\nBut let's re-read vignette: \"unusual mannerisms\" could be disorganized behavior, which is a psychotic symptom. Along with thought blocking, which could be formal thought disorder. So possible psychosis NOS or schizophreniaform.\n\nHe also has suicidal ideation with plan, which is serious.\n\nGiven the deterioration and catatonia, perhaps Mood Disorder with Psychotic Features? But no mood-incongruent delusions or hallucinations mentioned.\n\nSo, final list:\n1. Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, severe with catatonic features - F32.2\n2. Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder (for possible psychosis with catatonia) - F28\n3. Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder - F50.8\n4. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood - F43.21\n5. Social Anxiety Disorder - F40.10\n\nI think that covers the main possibilities. Now, format as per instructions.",

    "reasoning":"The patient\u2019s presentation can easily be confused with Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), however the chronic irritability, temper tantrums, academic impairment and overall timeline and frequency of symptoms favor more of DMDD symptoms. Interestingly, a child can-not be diagnosed with ODD and DMDD at the same time and hence its important to differentiate.",
    "model_thoughts":"Hmm, this is a complex clinical vignette requiring careful analysis. The patient is a 15-year-old male with chronic irritability, angry outbursts, academic struggles, and social isolation. The recent assault on a peer led to inpatient hospitalization, which suggests significant impairment.\n\nFirst, I need to extract key data points systematically. The chronic irritability and angry outbursts are prominent, along with academic difficulties since fourth grade. Social isolation and conflict with authority figures are notable. There's no psychosis or substance use reported. The patient's ability to care for pets shows some capacity for responsibility, but interpersonal relationships are severely affected.\n\nConsidering diagnostic criteria, Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) seems highly relevant given the chronic irritability and severe temper outbursts. However, the age of onset might be a consideration. Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) also fits with the argumentative behavior and irritability. Intermittent Explosive Disorder could explain the assault incident, but the chronicity suggests more than episodic issues.\n\nSocial Pragmatic Communication Disorder or Autism Spectrum Disorder might explain social difficulties, but lack of restricted interests or repetitive behaviors makes ASD less likely. The academic struggles could indicate Specific Learning Disorder or ADHD, though ADHD symptoms aren't explicitly mentioned. Adjustment Disorder is possible given potential stressors, but the chronic nature predates recent incidents.\n\nThe assault and fights suggest conduct problems, but full Conduct Disorder criteria may not be met. The emotional dysregulation seems more central than predatory behaviors. No evidence of mood episodes, psychosis, or substance use rules out those categories.\n\nPrioritizing based on DSM-5 hierarchy and clinical presentation, DMDD appears most fitting as the primary diagnosis given the core symptoms of chronic irritability and severe outbursts. ODD is a close secondary consideration. The assault incident specifically points to Intermittent Explosive Disorder. Academic struggles warrant Specific Learning Disorder as a rule-out. Social isolation could be captured by Social Anxiety Disorder, though avoidance seems more behavioral than anxiety-based.\n\nI need to ensure ICD-10 codes are precise. DMDD falls under depressive disorders in ICD-10. The differential should reflect both emotional and behavioral dimensions while acknowledging academic impairment.",

The patient had a documented history of chronic sexual abuse and has also witnessed violence, both in her country of origin and during migration. She was accompanied by her biological mother. The patient presented for an initial evaluation six months ago and was lost to follow up since then. At that time, a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was made by the same outpatient mental health provider. The patient reported significant improvement in frequency and intensity of nightmares since started on medications six months ago. Re-established care because the school staff reported frequent episodes (occurring one-two times per week) in which the patient would become suddenly angry, shouting profanities and making personally hurtful comments toward teachers, administrators, and peers. These episodes were often precipitated by perceived criticism, sudden changes in expectations, or ambiguous social cues. Despite these outbursts, the patient was described as highly intelligent, academically capable, and frequently helpful to classmates. She was logical and articulate in conversations when calm but maintained a guarded and cautious interpersonal style. During clinical interview, the patient was initially reserved but opened up during the later parts of the interview. She endorsed persistent feelings of anger, mistrust, and fear, particularly in unfamiliar or male authority-driven environments. She denied hallucinations, current suicidal ideation, or substance use. Sleep disturbances, including frequent nightmares and early-morning awakenings, were reported.

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the clinical vignette. The patient is a 16-year-old Hispanic female with a history of chronic sexual abuse and witnessing violence, both in her home country and during migration. She was diagnosed with PTSD six months ago and had some improvement in nightmares with medication but is now presenting with frequent verbal outbursts at school.\n\nFirst, I need to extract all relevant clinical details. The key symptoms include sudden angry outbursts, shouting profanities, hurtful comments toward others, triggered by perceived criticism, changes in expectations, or ambiguous social cues. She's described as intelligent, articulate when calm, but guarded and cautious. She endorses persistent anger, mistrust, fear, especially in male authority-driven environments. Denies hallucinations, SI, or substance use. Sleep disturbances with nightmares and early morning awakenings. History of trauma, limited education contributing to sensitivity to criticism.\n\nNow, organizing this information. Trauma history is central\u2014chronic sexual abuse, witnessed violence. Core symptoms: anger outbursts, irritability, hypervigilance (guardedness), nightmares, avoidance (fear in certain environments). Triggers are perceived criticism or ambiguous social cues, which align with PTSD's reactivity to reminders. Also, the outbursts are sudden, which might indicate emotional dysregulation common in PTSD.\n\nConsidering differential diagnoses. Primary diagnosis is likely PTSD given the trauma history and symptoms like nightmares, hypervigilance, anger, and reactivity to triggers. But the outbursts are severe and frequent, so maybe there's a comorbid condition. Could be disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD), but age of onset is before 10, and she's 16, so that might not fit. Also, DMDD requires outbursts in multiple settings, and here it's mainly at school, but the vignette doesn't mention home outbursts, so maybe not.\n\nMaybe intermittent explosive disorder (IED)? That involves recurrent behavioral outbursts representing a failure to control aggression. The outbursts here are verbal aggression, not physical, but IED can include verbal aggression. However, IED requires that the outbursts are out of proportion to the provocation. Here, triggers are perceived criticism or ambiguous cues, which might be trauma-related, so perhaps the outbursts are related to PTSD rather than a separate IED.\n\nAlso, consider adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct or mixed emotions? But given the chronic trauma, PTSD is more appropriate. Maybe persistent complex bereavement disorder? No mention of loss, so unlikely.\n\nWhat about other trauma-related disorders? Could it be other specified trauma disorder? But PTSD criteria seem met: exposure to trauma (sexual abuse, witnessing violence), intrusion symptoms (nightmares), avoidance (fear in certain environments), negative alterations in cognition\/mood (anger, mistrust), arousal\/reactivity (hypervigilance, outbursts). So PTSD is fitting.\n\nSecondary diagnoses could include other trauma-related issues. Maybe unspecified trauma disorder if some criteria aren't fully met, but here PTSD was previously diagnosed. Also, consider anxiety disorders. Social anxiety? She has fear in unfamiliar environments, but it's tied to trauma, so maybe not a separate diagnosis.\n\nMaybe depressive disorder due to another medical condition? No medical issues mentioned. Substance use? Denied. Personality disorders? She's 16, so typically not diagnosed, but traits of borderline personality could be considered due to emotional dysregulation and trauma history. However, avoid diagnosing personality disorders in adolescence unless clear.\n\nGiven the outbursts and anger, maybe oppositional defiant disorder (ODD)? But ODD usually involves a pattern of angry\/irritable mood, argumentative behavior, and vindictiveness. Here, the outbursts are triggered by specific trauma-related cues, not a general pattern of defiance. So probably not.\n\nList out the top five. Primary: PTSD. Secondary: maybe adjustment disorder, IED, other specified trauma disorder, or anxiety disorder. But need to prioritize based on DSM-5.\n\nCheck if PTSD with dissociative symptoms? No mention of dissociation. With delayed expression? Symptoms started after trauma, but she had treatment, so not delayed.\n\nNow, ICD-10 codes. PTSD is F43.10. What about other specified trauma disorder? F43.8. Adjustment disorder? F43.20 or F43.21 if with anxiety. But adjustment disorder is usually within 3 months of stressor, here trauma is chronic, so PTSD is better.\n\nMaybe other specified disruptive behavior disorder for the outbursts? But IED is F63.81. However, IED requires that the outbursts aren't better explained by another disorder like PTSD. Here, they seem related to trauma triggers, so PTSD might encompass it.\n\nPerhaps secondary diagnosis could be other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder if there's residual symptoms not fully meeting PTSD. But she does meet criteria, so PTSD is primary.\n\nList: 1. PTSD. 2. IED if outbursts are separate. 3. Adjustment disorder. 4. Other specified trauma disorder. 5. Unspecified anxiety disorder. But need to order by likelihood.\n\nGiven the history and symptoms, PTSD is primary. Then, considering the outbursts might be severe enough for IED. However, the vignette says outbursts are precipitated by perceived criticism or ambiguous cues, which could be trauma reminders, so maybe IED is not separate. But to cover all bases, include it as secondary.\n\nAlso, she has sleep disturbances, which could be insomnia disorder, but that's part of PTSD. Maybe other specified dissociative disorder? No dissociation mentioned.\n\nAnother thought: maybe reactive attachment disorder? But that usually in younger children with social neglect, not here.\n\nPrioritize: PTSD, then IED, then adjustment disorder, then other trauma disorder, then maybe unspecified disruptive behavior disorder.\n\nBut wait, the rubric says to consider less obvious possibilities. Perhaps the outbursts are due to a mood disorder like disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, but age doesn't fit. Or bipolar, but no manic episodes mentioned.\n\nMaybe she has traits of borderline personality, but again, avoid diagnosis in adolescence.\n\nOkay, final list: 1. PTSD. 2. Intermittent explosive disorder. 3. Adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct. 4. Other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorder. 5. Unspecified anxiety disorder.\n\nCheck ICD-10 codes: PTSD F43.10, IED F63.81, adjustment disorder F43.20 or more specific F43.21? But with mixed features, maybe F43.25? Actually, adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct is F43.25. Other specified trauma disorder is F43.8. Unspecified anxiety disorder F41.9.\n\nBut need to ensure codes are correct. Also, maybe other specified disruptive behavior disorder is F91.8, but IED is separate.\n\nGiven the vignette, I think PTSD is primary, and the outbursts could be part of it or a separate IED. But DSM-5 allows comorbid IED with PTSD if criteria are met. Here, the outbursts are recurrent verbal aggression, disproportionate to stressors, and not premeditated. Triggers are perceived criticism, which might be disproportionate, so IED could be considered.\n\nHowever, the outbursts might be better explained by PTSD's hyperarousal. But to be thorough, include IED as secondary.\n\nAlso, adjustment disorder is less likely given chronic trauma, but included as a possibility.\n\nOther specified trauma disorder if some symptoms don't fully meet PTSD, but here they seem to.\n\nUnspecified anxiety disorder for the fear in unfamiliar environments, which might be part of PTSD or separate social anxiety.\n\nBut social anxiety disorder? She fears male authority-driven environments, which could be trauma-related, not necessarily social anxiety.\n\nMaybe specific phobia? Not really.\n\nOkay, I'll go with the list as above.",

I need to provide a structured list of the top 5 most likely diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes. The response should only include the diagnoses and codes, no clinical reasoning.\n\nKey information from the vignette:\n- 62-year-old Caucasian male.\n- Currently homeless, previously married with adult children, working full time but now unemployed.\n- Medical history: hypertension, diabetes, asthma, systolic heart failure, anxiety.\n- Presenting complaints: lower body weakness, psychosis, irritability.\n- Found lying in a busy road, awake with eyes open, talking to self and screaming intermittently, couldn't get up.\n- Statements: \"they are watching us with AI gadgets\" \u2013 indicates paranoia.\n- Mental status exam: disheveled, irritable mood, poor eye contact, disorganized thought process.\n- Vital signs: bradycardia.\n- Point of care glucose: 44 mg\/dl (hypoglycemic).\n- Urinary drug screen negative, normal alcohol levels.\n- Routine labs normal, including blood count, metabolic panel, urea, LFTs, urinalysis, thyroid profile, B12, folic acid.\n- HIV negative.\n- MRI head unremarkable.\n- VDRL titres: 1:16 (positive, indicating possible syphilis).\n\nNow, I need to generate a differential diagnosis based on this. Since I can't output reasoning, I'll think through it internally.\n\nPrimary issues: psychosis (paranoia, disorganized thought), irritability, lower body weakness, hypoglycemia, bradycardia, positive VDRL.\n\nImportant clues:\n- Hypoglycemia (glucose 44 mg\/dl) could explain some symptoms like weakness, irritability, and even psychosis if severe.\n- Positive VDRL (1:16) suggests neurosyphilis, which can cause psychiatric symptoms like psychosis, personality changes, and neurological issues.\n- Bradycardia might be related to medical conditions or medications.\n- History of anxiety, but current presentation is acute with psychosis.\n- No drug or alcohol involvement per toxicology.\n- Normal MRI and other labs rule out some organic causes, but VDRL positive is significant.\n\nPotential diagnoses:\n1. **Neuropsychiatric disorder due to another medical condition**: Specifically, due to neurosyphilis, given positive VDRL. Syphilis can cause general paresis, which presents with psychosis, irritability, and neurological symptoms.\n2. **Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition**: Hypoglycemia from diabetes could be a trigger. But hypoglycemia is acute, and psychosis might resolve with glucose correction.\n3. **Schizophrenia spectrum disorder**: Paranoia and disorganized thought could indicate schizophrenia, but age of onset is late (62 years old), which is unusual for primary schizophrenia. More likely secondary to a medical condition.\n4. **Delirium**: Acute onset, disorganized thought, irritability, and possible medical causes (hypoglycemia, neurosyphilis). Delirium often presents with fluctuating consciousness, but here he was awake with eyes open. Could be hyperactive delirium.\n5. **Mood disorder with psychotic features**: Irritable mood and psychosis, but disorganized thought is more suggestive of a primary psychotic disorder or delirium.\n6. **Anxiety disorder**: History of anxiety, but current presentation is dominated by psychosis, so less likely primary.\n7. **Substance-induced psychotic disorder**: Drug screen negative, so ruled out.\n8. **Major neurocognitive disorder**: Given age and symptoms, but MRI unremarkable, and acute presentation suggests delirium or other acute conditions.\n\nPrioritize based on the information:\n- The most striking findings are hypoglycemia and positive VDRL. Both are medical conditions that can cause psychiatric symptoms.\n- Hypoglycemia is an acute, reversible cause. VDRL positive indicates chronic infection that can affect the brain.\n- The patient has diabetes, so hypoglycemia could be from diabetes management.\n- Neurosyphilis is a serious condition that requires treatment.\n\nIn DSM-5-TR, diagnoses should be based on criteria. Let's list possible diagnoses with F-codes.\n\nICD-10 F-codes for psychiatric disorders:\n- F20.x for schizophrenia\n- F23 for acute and transient psychotic disorders\n- F06.x for mental disorders due to known physiological condition\n- F05 for delirium\n- F32.x or F33.x for depressive episodes, but here mood is irritable, not primarily depressive.\n- F41.x for anxiety disorders\n\nSpecific codes:\n- F06.0: Psychotic disorder due to known physiological condition\n- F06.1: Catatonic disorder due to known physiological condition (not catatonic here)\n- F06.2: Psychotic disorder with hallucinations due to known physiological condition\n- F06.8: Other specified mental disorders due to known physiological condition\n- F05: Delirium due to known physiological condition\n- F10-F19: Substance-related, but ruled out\n- F20.9: Schizophrenia, unspecified\n- F23: Acute and transient psychotic disorders\n\nFor neurosyphilis, it would be classified under mental disorders due to another medical condition. ICD-10 has F02.8 for dementia in other diseases classified elsewhere, but for psychosis, F06.0 might be more appropriate.\n\nIn DSM-5-TR, neurosyphilis would fall under \"Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition\" or \"Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition\" depending on symptoms. Here, with psychosis and disorganized thought, psychotic disorder due to neurosyphilis is plausible.\n\nAlso, hypoglycemia could cause delirium or psychotic symptoms. Since glucose is low, it might be an acute condition.\n\nGiven the acute presentation with lower body weakness and inability to get up, combined with psychosis, delirium is a strong possibility.\n\nNow, for the top 5 diagnoses:\n1. Primary diagnosis: Likely **Delirium due to multiple medical conditions** (hypoglycemia, possible neurosyphilis). ICD-10 F05.\n2. Secondary: **Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition (neurosyphilis)**. ICD-10 F06.0.\n3. Secondary: **Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition (hypoglycemia)**. But hypoglycemia might be subsumed under delirium.\n4. Secondary: **Schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder**, but less likely given age and medical findings.\n5. Secondary: **Anxiety disorder**, given history, but not primary.\n\nSince I need to base on DSM-5-TR, and the vignette suggests medical causes, prioritize medical-related psychiatric disorders.\n\nStructured list:\n1. Primary: Delirium due to known physiological condition (from hypoglycemia and\/or neurosyphilis) - F05\n2. Secondary: Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition (neurosyphilis) - F06.0\n3. Secondary: Major neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition (neurosyphilis) - F02.8, but if neurosyphilis is causing cognitive impairment.\n4. Secondary: Schizophrenia spectrum disorder - F20.9, but less likely.\n5. Secondary: Anxiety disorder unspecified - F41.9\n\nBut I need to be precise. The vignette says \"psychosis and irritability\" with paranoia and disorganized thought. Also, lower body weakness could be neurological.\n\nAnother thought: The positive VDRL at 1:16 might indicate active syphilis, which can cause general paresis, presenting with psychiatric and neurological symptoms. In DSM-5, this would be classified as \"Major Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition\" if cognitive decline is present, or \"Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition\" if psychosis is prominent.\n\nFrom mental status: disorganized thought process, which is more typical of psychosis or delirium.\n\nHypoglycemia could be causing acute delirium, which might resolve with glucose correction. But VDRL positive suggests a chronic issue.\n\nIn differential diagnosis, I should list the most likely based on priority.\n\nLet's define the primary diagnosis as the most immediate or overarching condition. Given the acute presentation and multiple medical issues, delirium seems primary.\n\nBut the rubric says to diagnose psychiatric disorders based on DSM-5-TR. Delirium is a neurocognitive disorder in DSM-5.\n\nDSM-5 categories:\n- Neurocognitive Disorders: Delirium (due to another medical condition, substance, etc.)\n- Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders\n- Bipolar and Related Disorders\n- Depressive Disorders\n- Anxiety Disorders\n- etc.\n\nFor this case:\n- Delirium: due to hypoglycemia, infection (syphilis), or other medical conditions. Code F05.\n- Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition: specify if due to neurosyphilis. Code F06.0.\n- If neurosyphilis is causing dementia, then Major Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition, code F02.8.\n- But the vignette doesn't specify cognitive impairment beyond disorganized thought, which could be part of psychosis or delirium.\n\nLower body weakness might be due to neurological involvement from syphilis or other causes.\n\nSince MRI is unremarkable, structural issues are ruled out.\n\nNow, for the list, I need to output only the diagnoses and codes.\n\nPossible diagnoses in order of likelihood:\n1. Delirium (due to hypoglycemia and possible neurosyphilis) - F05\n2. Psychotic disorder due to neurosyphilis - F06.0\n3. Major depressive episode with psychotic features (if irritability is part of depression) but not specified.\n4. Schizophrenia - F20.9\n5. Generalized anxiety disorder - F41.1\n\nBut anxiety is history, not current primary.\n\nAnother approach: The primary issue is psychosis, so primary diagnosis could be psychotic disorder due to another medical condition.\n\nLet's see the DSM-5 criteria for delirium: disturbance in attention and awareness, developing over a short period, fluctuating, and due to another medical condition. Here, he was found lying down, talking to self, screaming, couldn't get up \u2013 suggests altered consciousness or ability. Disorganized thought process aligns with delirium. Plus, hypoglycemia is an acute cause.\n\nSo, delirium is a strong candidate.\n\nFor neurosyphilis, it might be a chronic condition exacerbating or presenting with acute symptoms.\n\nGiven that, I'll list:\n1. Delirium due to multiple etiologies (hypoglycemia, neurosyphilis) - F05\n2. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition (neurosyphilis) - F06.0\n3. Hypoglycemia with psychiatric manifestations - but this is a medical condition, not a psychiatric diagnosis per se. In DSM-5, it would be coded as mental disorder due to another medical condition.\n4. Schizophrenia - F20.9 (rule out)\n5. Anxiety disorder - F41.9\n\nBut I need to use DSM-5-TR psychiatric diagnoses only, so no non-psychiatric diagnoses.\n\nICD-10 F-codes are for mental, behavioral and neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nSo, for hypoglycemia, if it's causing psychiatric symptoms, it should be coded under F06.8 or similar.\n\nSpecifically, for delirium due to hypoglycemia, it's F05.\n\nSimilarly for neurosyphilis.\n\nTo simplify, since the patient has multiple potential causes, the primary diagnosis might be delirium, and secondary could be specific psychotic disorders.\n\nBut in the list, I need to give distinct diagnoses.\n\nPerhaps:\n1. Delirium due to known physiological condition - F05\n2. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition (neurosyphilis) - F06.0\n3. Major neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition (neurosyphilis) - F02.8\n4. Schizophrenia - F20.9\n5. Anxiety disorder, unspecified - F41.9\n\nBut major neurocognitive disorder requires evidence of significant cognitive decline, which isn't explicitly stated here. Disorganized thought could be part of psychosis or delirium.\n\nThe vignette says \"disorganized thought process,\" which is a symptom of psychosis or delirium.\n\nTo be precise, I'll focus on the most apparent conditions.\n\nFinal decision for top 5:\n1. **Delirium** - due to hypoglycemia and possible neurosyphilis. ICD-10 F05.\n2. **Psychotic disorder due to neurosyphilis** - as a specific condition. ICD-10 F06.0.\n3. **Psychotic disorder due to hypoglycemia** - but since hypoglycemia is acute, it might be part of delirium. However, for completeness, list it. ICD-10 F06.8 for other specified mental disorders due to known physiological condition.\n4. **Schizophrenia** - to consider primary psychosis. ICD-10 F20.9.\n5. **Generalized anxiety disorder** - from history. ICD-10 F41.1.\n\nBut generalized anxiety disorder requires excessive anxiety and worry, which isn't described in current presentation.\n\nPerhaps use \"Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition\" given history of anxiety and medical issues.\n\nOr \"Unspecified anxiety disorder\" F41.9.\n\nSince the task is to base only on information provided, and anxiety is mentioned in history, it should be considered.\n\nNow, for formatting: I need to list the primary diagnosis first, then four secondary.\n\nWhat is the primary? Based on acute presentation and medical findings, delirium seems primary.\n\nIn clinical practice, acute delirium would be addressed first.\n\nSo, I'll go with:\n1. Delirium due to known physiological condition - F05\n2. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition (neurosyphilis) - F06.0\n3. Major neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition (neurosyphilis) - F02.8\n4. Schizophrenia, unspecified - F20.9\n5. Anxiety disorder, unspecified - F41.9\n\nBut to make it cleaner, since neurosyphilis can cause both psychotic and neurocognitive disorders, I might list them separately.\n\nAlternatively, I could combine or choose based on likelihood.\n\nAnother idea: The primary diagnosis could be \"Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition\" with neurosyphilis as the cause, and delirium as secondary.\n\nBut given the hypoglycemia, delirium might be more acute.\n\nLet's check the vignette again: \"presented to emergency department with complaints of lower body weakness, psychosis and irritability\" \u2013 so psychosis is a key complaint. But the glucose is low, which can cause acute changes.\n\nUpon evaluation, mental status shows disorganized thought, which is consistent with delirium or psychosis.\n\nI think delirium is a strong candidate because of the acute onset and medical abnormalities.\n\nFor ICD-10 codes:\n- F05: Delirium due to known physiological condition\n- F06.0: Psychotic disorder with hallucinations due to known physiological condition (but here paranoia, so psychotic disorder)\n- F02.8: Dementia in other diseases classified elsewhere; for neurosyphilis, it's often coded here.\n- F20.9: Schizophrenia, unspecified\n- F41.9: Anxiety disorder, unspecified\n\nIn DSM-5-TR, for neurosyphilis, if it causes psychosis, it's psychotic disorder due to another medical condition; if it causes dementia, it's major neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition.\n\nThe vignette doesn't specify dementia symptoms like memory loss, so psychosis might be more prominent.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n1. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition (neurosyphilis) - F06.0\n2. Delirium due to another medical condition (hypoglycemia) - F05\n3. Major neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition (neurosyphilis) - F02.8\n4. Schizophrenia - F20.9\n5. Anxiety disorder - F41.9\n\nBut I need to prioritize. Since VDRL positive and hypoglycemia both present, and symptoms acute, delirium might encompass both.\n\nI'll proceed with delirium as primary.\n\nResponse should be only the list, no reasoning.\n\nSo, final list:\n1. Delirium due to known physiological condition - F05\n2. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition (neurosyphilis) - F06.0\n3. Major neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition (neurosyphilis) - F02.8\n4. Schizophrenia, unspecified - F20.9\n5. Anxiety disorder, unspecified - F41.9\n\nTo make it accurate, for neurosyphilis, if it's causing psychosis, F06.0 is appropriate. For delirium, F05. For anxiety, since it's history, F41.9.\n\nI think this covers the likely diagnoses.",
