    "vignette":"Leroy is a 34 year old male, whose chief complaint is, \u201cI am having intrusive thoughts.\u201d Leroy reports that \u201csince childhood, I have been experiencing intrusive thoughts.\u201d He reports he has met with a number of psychiatrists in the past, and has tried a range of different psychiatric medications. Leroy reports he was recently recommended by his present physician to see a psychiatrist again, given how distressing his intrusive thoughts have become. His previous psychiatrist started him on Zoloft, and gave him recommendation for community based mental health psychotherapist.  Leroy has been taking the Zoloft (200 mg daily) for about 5 years, for what he states his provider thought was \u201canxiety or depression.\u201d Leroy acknowledges history of periods of \u201csadness\u201d, stating \u201cyeah sad, sometimes, but not depressed; when things get out of control; its been a while though; when something feels out of reach.\u201d Denied present or past suicidal ideation, and denied problems with active thoughts, plans or intents of harm to self or others. Leroy insists no problems with perceptual distortion or paranoia, and denied thought insertion or thought broadcasting.  Leroy stated that the intrusive thoughts, \u201cfirst started happening when I was a kid, I was able to cope with them; getting better understanding what they were; ways to get them to go away; calm myself down and regain control and go on with my life; now that is not working.\u201d Leroy states the most recent intrusive thought has been a fear that the chart bus he drives from his local airport to downtown stop will \u201cslide off the road because of ice or snow.\u201d He thinks about this, on average, about 30 to 45 minutes a day.  Leroy endorsed episodes of \u201cpanic\u201d and \u201cmy body almost feels like its paralyzed; I experience pain from my spine up\u201d, which lasts for a couple of days at a time. With regards to \u201cgeneralized anxiety\u201d, patient reports \u201cI would have these thoughts about my ailing mother; she has schizophrenia; my body would react to whatever I was thinking about her; my body tenses up when that happens.\u201d Leroy denied any preoccupations about his physical health, nor inability to leave the home because of anxiety. He reports to work regularly, and rarely misses any work unless he is very sick. He says he is never late to work or planned appointments. Leroy has a girlfriend, and says that relationship is going \u201cgreat.\u201d In his spare time, he continues to join his friends for basketball pickup games and video game nights, which he still enjoys. Leroy does remember a feeling of having to tap the door handle a few times before he opens it, but said this never lasted more than a few second and was not associated with any fear of catastrophic consequences if he did not complete the task.  Leroy acknowledges observed violence\/abuse of his parents when growing up, and with harsh parenting to his 3 siblings, patient denied problems with flashbacks, nightmares or hypervigilance associated with the trauma. Patient works second shift, gets home around 1:30 a.m., reports falling asleep at 2:30 a.m. and wakes up at 10\/11 a.m., and can typically sleep through the night without interruption. He reports his energy level is \u201cnormal through the week.\u201d Denied recent or past mania. Reports contributing stressors are \u201cwork --- not the most peaceful environment.\u201d Also reports mother suffers from \u201ctype of schizophrenia and for a while she was taking medication and just recently now decided to stop; that\u2019s been going on for quite some time.\u201d Leroy\u2019s urine toxicology returned with marijuana, and TSH level was within normal limits.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the clinical vignette about Leroy. He's a 34-year-old male with a chief complaint of intrusive thoughts since childhood. The key points here are the long history, the specific intrusive thought about the charter bus sliding off the road, and the fact that he's been on Zoloft for five years for what was thought to be anxiety or depression. He mentions periods of sadness but denies current depression or suicidal ideation.\n\nFirst, I need to extract and organize the relevant data. Leroy has intrusive thoughts that are time-consuming (30-45 minutes daily) and cause distress. He also mentions episodes of \"panic\" and bodily sensations like pain from his spine up, lasting a couple of days. There's a history of trauma with observed violence\/abuse but no PTSD symptoms like flashbacks or nightmares. He has some compulsive behavior like tapping the door handle briefly but no associated fear. He works regularly, has a good relationship, and enjoys social activities. His mother has schizophrenia, and his urine tox is positive for marijuana.\n\nNow, thinking about differential diagnoses. The primary issue seems to be obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) given the intrusive thoughts that are time-consuming and cause significant distress, even though compulsions aren't prominently mentioned except for the brief door-tapping. However, the thoughts are ego-dystonic and he tries to suppress them, which aligns with OCD. The Zoloft might be partially helping but not fully.\n\nNext, considering the panic episodes. He describes episodes of panic with physical symptoms lasting days, which might indicate panic disorder or possibly another anxiety disorder. But he doesn't mention specific panic attacks with acute onset, so maybe it's more generalized anxiety. However, he denies preoccupation with health or agoraphobia.\n\nThe trauma history without PTSD symptoms rules out PTSD. The absence of manic episodes rules out bipolar. The marijuana use could be a substance use issue, but it's not clear if it's causing the symptoms. His sleep schedule is irregular due to work but not necessarily indicative of a sleep disorder.\n\nOther possibilities include adjustment disorder given work stressors, but the symptoms are long-standing. Given the chronic nature since childhood, OCD seems the most fitting. The secondary diagnoses could include other anxiety disorders, trauma-related disorders, and substance use.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the clinical case vignette about Emil. I need to extract all relevant information and organize it logically to support my diagnostic reasoning.\n\nFirst, Emil is a 22-year-old male. He mentions his mom insisted on meeting because she's concerned. Key issues he reports include multiple sclerosis (MS), losing his fianc\u00e9 Lizzy, losing his dog, and losing his career as a farmer. He had a previous girlfriend who was from a wealthy background (\"blue blood from the Cape\"), and they used to fish together. \n\nThere's a significant event four years ago where he was attacked at a bar, had beer bottles smashed on his head, and was hospitalized. Brain scans were done, but he doesn't recall the results. After the attack, he stopped fishing and started heavy drinking\u2014at least 8 drinks daily. This led to missing work, ending his relationship, and two DUIs. He tried cutting down but couldn't until recently; he's been sober for 76 days.\n\nTwo years ago, during an MS flare, he experienced two weeks of insomnia and constant anger. During that time, he took impulsive trips to Baltimore, attempted starting a business, had many sexual indiscretions, and exhibited grandiose behavior (claiming to be a celebrity who would cure autism). He felt endless energy and like he could take on the world. No similar episodes since, and he denies recent mood symptoms, hallucinations, paranoia, or trauma aside from the losses mentioned. He also denies recent anxiety, panic, or OCD symptoms.\n\nNow, organizing this data: The attack four years ago might have caused a traumatic brain injury (TBI), given the head injury and hospitalization. The heavy drinking starting after that suggests possible alcohol use disorder, especially since it led to DUIs and functional impairment. His recent sobriety is a positive factor.\n\nThe episode two years ago is critical: during an MS flare, he had insomnia, anger, impulsivity, grandiosity, increased energy, and goal-directed activity. This sounds like a manic episode, especially since it lasted two weeks. He denies recent symptoms, but that past episode is significant. MS can sometimes trigger mood disorders due to neurological changes.\n\nHe also mentions multiple sclerosis, which is a medical condition that can affect mental health. The losses (fianc\u00e9, dog, career) are psychosocial stressors that could contribute to mood issues, but he denies current depression.\n\nDifferential diagnosis: \n1. Bipolar I Disorder, single manic episode, in partial remission (since he's been sober and without recent symptoms). The past manic episode meets criteria if it caused significant impairment (business ventures, sexual indiscretions). ICD-10: F31.0 for manic episode, but since it's past, perhaps F31.9 for unspecified bipolar. Wait, DSM-5-TR would specify if it's a single manic episode, which is coded as F30.8 for other manic episode or F30.9 unspecified. Actually, bipolar I requires at least one manic episode, so F31.9 might be appropriate.\n\n2. Alcohol Use Disorder, severe, in early remission: He had heavy drinking, inability to cut down, DUIs, and social\/occupational problems. Now sober 76 days, so in early remission. ICD-10: F10.21 for alcohol dependence, in early remission.\n\n3. Neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury: The head injury four years ago with possible brain scans showing findings. He doesn't recall results, but the attack could have caused residual cognitive issues. Alcohol use could exacerbate this. ICD-10: F06.8 for other specified mental disorders due to known physiological condition, or F07.0 for personality change due to TBI. But given the behavioral changes post-injury, it's plausible.\n\n4. Adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct: He experienced multiple losses (fianc\u00e9, dog, career) which are stressors. However, he denies recent depressed mood, so maybe not current. But the initial reaction to losses might have triggered the drinking and behavioral issues. ICD-10: F43.25 for adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, or F43.24 with disturbance of conduct. Given his behaviors, disturbance of conduct might fit.\n\n5. Multiple sclerosis affecting mood: MS is a known cause of mood disorders due to demyelination. The manic episode occurred during an MS flare, suggesting a possible direct physiological effect. ICD-10: F06.34 for bipolar disorder due to MS, or F06.8 for other specified. Since the manic episode might be secondary to MS, that should be considered.\n\nPrioritizing: The manic episode is prominent, so bipolar I is primary. Alcohol use disorder is clear from history. TBI is likely given the head injury. Adjustment disorder might explain some reactions to stressors, but given the manic episode, bipolar takes precedence. MS as an etiological factor for the mood disorder.\n\nSo, structured list:\n1. Bipolar I Disorder, single manic episode, in partial remission - F31.0 (manic episode without psychotic features) or F31.9 if unspecified. Actually, DSM-5-TR codes: F31.0 for manic episode, but since it's past and he's in remission, maybe F31.79 for other specified bipolar with current episode in partial remission. Let me check: Bipolar I, most recent episode manic, in partial remission is F31.71. Yes, that fits.\n\n2. Alcohol Use Disorder, severe, in early remission - F10.21\n\n3. Neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury, mild - F06.8 (if attributed to TBI) or F07.0 for personality change. Since cognitive issues aren't explicitly stated, but behavioral changes are, maybe F07.0. However, the vignette doesn't detail cognitive deficits, so perhaps other specified mental disorder due to known physiological condition (TBI). Code F06.8.\n\n4. Adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct - F43.24, given the impulsive behaviors following losses.\n\n5. Bipolar and related disorder due to multiple sclerosis, with manic features - F06.34. This is important because the manic episode occurred during an MS flare, suggesting a direct link.\n\nBut note: DSM-5-TR allows for both primary and secondary diagnoses. Since the manic episode might be due to MS, it could be coded as F06.34 instead of F31.71. However, the patient has a history of heavy drinking which could also induce manic symptoms. But the timing with MS flare is key. Given the information, I'll list both possibilities, but primary should be the most impactful.\n\nFinal list based on likelihood:\nPrimary: Bipolar I Disorder, most recent episode manic, in partial remission - F31.71\nSecondary: Alcohol Use Disorder, severe, in early remission - F10.21\nSecondary: Neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury, mild - F06.8\nSecondary: Adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct - F43.24\nSecondary: Bipolar and related disorder due to multiple sclerosis, with manic features - F06.34\n\nWait, but bipolar due to MS and primary bipolar might be mutually exclusive. In DSM-5-TR, if the mood disorder is due to another medical condition, it's coded separately. The vignette says the manic episode occurred during an MS flare, so it's plausible that MS caused it. However, he also had prior alcohol use which could complicate. Given the data, I think F06.34 should be included as a secondary diagnosis because MS is a known factor.\n\nBut in the differential, I need to choose the top 5. Perhaps instead of having two bipolar diagnoses, I should list one as primary and consider the other as secondary if applicable. However, DSM-5-TR would typically code either as primary bipolar or due to medical condition, not both. So I need to decide which is more likely.\n\nConsidering the history: The attack four years ago with head injury, then heavy drinking, then two years ago during MS flare a manic episode. The manic episode might be secondary to MS, but also could be primary bipolar triggered by stress or TBI. Given the complexity, I'll list the primary as bipolar due to MS because of the temporal association with the flare.\n\nSo revised:\n1. Bipolar and related disorder due to multiple sclerosis, with manic features - F06.34\n2. Alcohol Use Disorder, severe, in early remission - F10.21\n3. Neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury, mild - F06.8\n4. Adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct - F43.24\n5. Unspecified bipolar and related disorder - F31.9 (if the primary is due to MS, this might be redundant, so maybe another diagnosis)\n\nWait, I need five distinct diagnoses. Perhaps include PTSD? He was attacked, but he denies trauma except for losses. He doesn't report flashbacks or avoidance, so probably not. What about other conditions? He had impulsive behaviors, so maybe borderline personality traits? But not enough data. \n\nAnother possibility: Substance\/medication-induced bipolar disorder due to alcohol? But he was sober during the manic episode, as it was two years ago and he was drinking before but not necessarily during? The vignette says he started drinking after the attack four years ago, and the manic episode was two years ago, so he might have been drinking then. But the episode occurred during an MS flare, so more likely due to MS.\n\nSo, my final list:\n1. Bipolar and related disorder due to multiple sclerosis, with manic features - F06.34\n2. Alcohol Use Disorder, severe, in early remission - F10.21\n3. Mild Neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury - F06.8\n4. Adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct - F43.24\n5. Unspecified depressive disorder - F32.9 (considering his losses, but he denies current depression, so maybe not). Alternatively, other specified trauma-related disorder? But he denies trauma symptoms. \n\nPerhaps other specified bipolar and related disorder, but that's covered. I think four are sufficient, but the instruction says top five. Maybe include other specified mental disorder due to known physiological condition (MS) for mood symptoms, but that's already in F06.34.\n\nLet me check ICD-10 codes: \n- F06.34 is for bipolar disorder due to known physiological condition (MS).\n- F10.21 for alcohol dependence in early remission.\n- F06.8 for other specified mental disorders due to brain disease, damage, dysfunction.\n- F43.24 for adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct.\n- For the fifth, perhaps F07.0 for personality change due to TBI, but that's similar to F06.8. Or F09 for unspecified mental disorder due to known physiological condition.\n\nGiven the data, I'll include personality change due to TBI as a possibility because of the behavioral changes post-injury.\n\nSo:\n1. Bipolar and related disorder due to multiple sclerosis, with manic features - F06.34\n2. Alcohol Use Disorder, severe, in early remission - F10.21\n3. Personality change due to traumatic brain injury - F07.0\n4. Adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct - F43.24\n5. Mild Neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury - F06.8\n\nBut having two TBI-related diagnoses might be redundant. Perhaps choose one. Since the vignette doesn't specify cognitive deficits, personality change might be more fitting given the behavioral shift after the attack.\n\nFinal decision: \nPrimary: Bipolar disorder due to MS because the manic episode is temporally related to MS flare.\nSecondary: Alcohol use disorder is clear.\nSecondary: TBI-related personality change as he stopped fishing and started drinking impulsively post-injury.\nSecondary: Adjustment disorder for reactions to losses.\nSecondary: Other specified mental disorder due to TBI for any residual cognitive or mood issues.\n\nI think that's reasonable. Now, outputting only the list without reasoning.",

The patient frequently punches her mother in the legs, and in the stomach, and the patient even threw her ipad at the pediatrician when she asked the patient what was upsetting her. Most of the patients psychiatric history is gathered from her mother, given how irritable the patient is during the exam.

When patient was about 11 years of age, her biological father left the home to join the military, and has deployed ever since. Around 12 years of age, around summertime, the patient appeared much more talkative, energetic, and would go several days only needing about 3 hours of sleep at night. She was more impulsive during these times, and believed she had super powers to \u201cmake her friends get in trouble at school\u201d, even when she was not at school herself. She was never tired the following day. During that same period, she had many temper tantrums throughout the day, almost every day of the week, that seemed disproportionate to circumstances, like having to have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich instead of a peanut butter and fluff sandwich. The tantrums would last several hours in a day. This pattern of behavior would last for several weeks at a time, with periods of months returning to normal mood and behavior. The patient never appeared to be hallucination or responding to internal stimuli, and never appeared sad or depressed. Neveah had to be hospitalized during an episode like this when she was 13 years old. Neveah refuses to take medications for her symptoms. The start of this year academic year, that patient appeared more calm and in good behavioral control, but began to have similar symptoms of irritability, violence at home, not needing to sleep, talking fast, and property destruction at home.",

    "model_thoughts":"Hmm, this is a complex clinical vignette requiring careful analysis. The patient is a 14-year-old girl presenting with severe behavioral dysregulation, including physical aggression, irritability, and property destruction. Key features include a history of episodic symptoms starting around age 12, with periods of heightened energy, decreased need for sleep (only 3 hours per night), talkativeness, impulsivity, and grandiose beliefs about having superpowers. These episodes last several weeks with intervening periods of normal mood and behavior. There's no reported history of hallucinations, delusions, or depressive symptoms.\n\nThe developmental history includes premature birth and NICU stay, but normal milestone achievement. Psychosocial stressors include father's departure at age 11. Current presentation shows severe irritability and aggression toward her pregnant mother.\n\nConsidering DSM-5-TR criteria, the episodic nature with clear manic-like symptoms (decreased need for sleep, grandiosity, increased energy) points toward a bipolar spectrum disorder. The absence of depressive episodes and the presence of irritability rather than euphoria suggests a manic or hypomanic episode. The severity requiring hospitalization at age 13 supports this.\n\nDifferential diagnosis must consider disorders with similar presentations: disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (but episodic nature rules this out), oppositional defiant disorder (but episodic with manic features), ADHD (but symptoms are episodic, not chronic), and intermittent explosive disorder (but episodes include manic features). The aggression toward mother's pregnancy adds contextual stress but doesn't change core symptoms.\n\nBased on symptom duration and severity, bipolar I disorder seems most fitting given the hospitalization history.

The timeline is crucial - symptoms began 2.5 months ago after a psychosocial stressor (job loss), with progressive worsening.\n\nGiven the duration (more than 1 month but less than 6 months) and absence of mood symptoms, Brief Psychotic Disorder fits best as primary diagnosis. Need to consider Schizophreniform Disorder too, but the shorter duration and acute onset favor Brief Psychotic Disorder. Substance-induced and medical causes are ruled out by negative tox screen and denial of head injury.\n\nFor differential, Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features warrants consideration due to low energy\/motivation symptoms, though psychotic symptoms appear primary. Schizotypal Personality Disorder could explain longstanding odd beliefs but acute onset argues against it. Delusional Disorder might be possible but hallucinations aren't typical. PTSD seems less likely without clear trauma history.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the clinical vignette about Stacy. She's a 54-year-old Navy Veteran presenting to the ER with sensations of bugs crawling on her, severe thirst, and tremors starting 36 hours after a tummy tuck surgery. She's been on bed rest, which might be relevant.\n\nShe mentions drinking 4-5 beers daily and has been using Klonopin for 15 years, bought online since her PCP stopped prescribing it a year ago. Sometimes she combines beer and Klonopin in the morning to manage shakes. That sounds like dependence and possible withdrawal issues.\n\nThe chart shows previous ER visits with positive tox for alcohol, benzodiazepines, opiates, and amphetamines, but she wasn't prescribed the latter two. She admits to trying to cut back on alcohol but drinks more now for the same effect. Labs show severely low sodium and potassium. Denies mood issues or hallucinations.\n\nHmm, the bugs crawling sensation could be formication, often seen in substance withdrawal or intoxication. Severe thirst and electrolyte imbalances might point to medical issues exacerbated by alcohol use. The timeline after surgery and bed rest could indicate reduced intake or changes in habits triggering withdrawal.\n\nShe has a history of polysubstance use based on tox screens, though she only admits to alcohol and benzodiazepines. The combination of substances and withdrawal symptoms suggests Substance-Induced Disorders. Low electrolytes could be due to poor nutrition or alcohol effects.\n\nPrimary diagnosis might be Alcohol Withdrawal, given the tremors, attempts to manage shakes with alcohol\/benzodiazepines, and increased drinking. Formication can occur in withdrawal. Secondary diagnoses could include Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Withdrawal from benzodiazepines, especially since she's using them without prescription and mixing with alcohol.\n\nPolysubstance Use Disorder seems likely due to multiple substances in tox screens. Severe electrolyte imbalances might indicate a medical condition, but psychiatric-wise, Substance\/Medication-Induced Delirium could be considered given acute onset post-surgery and symptoms like formication, though she's alert enough to provide history.\n\nOther possibilities like Psychotic Disorder due to formication, but she denies other hallucinations and mood issues, so Substance-Induced might fit better. PTSD or other disorders aren't mentioned, so sticking to substance-related diagnoses based on the vignette.",

I must follow the rubric but not output my reasoning, only the structured list of diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes. The rubric is for my internal use to ensure I'm thinking at an expert level, but my response should be just the diagnoses.\n\nI need to extract and organize data effectively (Data Extraction and Organization at Level 5) and generate a sophisticated differential diagnosis (Diagnostic Reasoning and Differential Diagnosis at Level 5). However, the instruction says: \"Do not output any of your clinical reasoning; your response should consist only of the structured list of diagnoses and corresponding F-codes.\"\n\nSo, I'll process the vignette internally and then list the top 5 most likely diagnoses with F-codes.\n\nKey information from the vignette:\n\n- Evan is 62, white, Harvard Professor in Economics.\n\n- History of heavy alcohol use, but sober for 7 months after outpatient rehab.\n\n- Presented to ER after taking ten 1 mg Klonopin at once, stating he wanted to sleep, not to kill himself, and regrets it.\n\n- Recent discord with wife, fear she might leave him.\n\n- Relapsed with alcohol use 2 days prior, drinking about 6 standard drinks each day, intoxicated at time of overdose.\n\n- Reports feeling loss of purpose: \"I used to be so active... Now, I feel like I don\u2019t have purpose,\" due to reduced teaching obligations.\n\n- Denies active thoughts, plans, or intents of harm to self or others.\n\n- Denies recent or past mania or psychosis.\n\n- Symptoms: increased need for sleep (up to 14 hours a day), still tired when awake.\n\n- Unintentional weight loss (10 pounds over past month).\n\n- Increased difficulty concentrating.\n\n- Feels like \"walking through mud,\" wants to enjoy life again.\n\n- Sometimes cries without knowing why.\n\n- Denies hopelessness or despair.\n\n- Denies trauma history, OCD, or panic symptoms.\n\n- Sustained a fall at home, leading to ER visit, with left peri-orbital ecchymosis and abrasions.\n\n- Head CT shows subdural hematoma (2-3 mm initially, then 5-7 mm on repeat), but denies headache, vision changes, confusion, or weakness.\n\n- Taking Cymbalta for history of depression for over 5 years.\n\nI need to base diagnoses only on the information provided and my clinical expertise. The diagnoses should be psychiatric, using DSM-5-TR criteria, and list ICD-10 F-codes.\n\nTop 5 most likely diagnoses: primary diagnosis first, then four secondary diagnoses.\n\nLet's identify possible psychiatric conditions:\n\n1. **Depressive Disorder**: He has symptoms like increased sleep, weight loss, difficulty concentrating, anhedonia (wanting to enjoy life again), crying spells, loss of purpose. He's on Cymbalta for depression history. This could be a Major Depressive Episode or Persistent Depressive Disorder. Given the duration and symptoms, likely a Major Depressive Episode, possibly recurrent. He denies hopelessness or despair, but other symptoms are present.\n\n2. **Substance Use Disorders**: History of heavy alcohol use, recent relapse. This could be Alcohol Use Disorder. Also, the Klonopin overdose might indicate issues with sedatives, but he took it intentionally for sleep, not necessarily abuse. But given the context, Alcohol Use Disorder is prominent.\n\n3. **Adjustment Disorder**: He has stressors: discord with wife, reduced work obligations. But symptoms seem more severe than typical adjustment disorder, leaning towards depression.\n\n4. **Sleep-Wake Disorders**: Increased need for sleep, still tired. Could be Hypersomnolence Disorder, but it might be secondary to depression.\n\n5. **Neurocognitive Disorders**: He's 62, had a fall and subdural hematoma. Could this indicate delirium or other neurocognitive issues? But he denies confusion, headache, etc. However, subdural hematoma might affect cognition, but in psychiatry, we consider possible neurocognitive disorders due to medical conditions.\n\n6. **Suicidal Behavior**: He took an overdose of Klonopin, but states it wasn't suicidal. This could be considered under Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention, like Non-suicidal Self-Injury or Substance Intoxication. But he was intoxicated at the time, so it might be accidental or impulsive due to intoxication.\n\n7. **Anxiety Disorders**: He mentions fear of wife leaving him, which could be related to relationship anxiety, but no specific anxiety disorder symptoms are highlighted.\n\n8. **Personality Disorders**: Not enough information, but chronic issues might be considered.\n\nBased on DSM-5-TR, I need to list specific diagnoses with F-codes.\n\nPrimary diagnosis: Likely Major Depressive Disorder, given the symptoms and history. He's on Cymbalta, indicating treatment for depression.\n\nSecondary diagnoses: Alcohol Use Disorder, Sedative\/Hypnotic Intoxication or Overdose, Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, and possibly Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Traumatic Brain Injury or Other Medical Condition.\n\nBut let's prioritize based on the vignette.\n\nHe presented after an overdose, which is a key event. But the instruction is to diagnose based on the overall case.\n\nList top 5:\n\n1. Primary diagnosis: Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent episode, moderate to severe? He has significant symptoms.\n\n2. Alcohol Use Disorder, in early remission? He was sober for 7 months but relapsed. DSM-5-TR specifies codes based on severity and remission.\n\n3. Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder? He took Klonopin, which is a benzodiazepine, but no history of misuse mentioned except this overdose. Might be better as Other Substance-Related Disorder.\n\n4. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood? But depression seems more chronic.\n\n5. Sleep-Wake Disorder, Hypersomnolence Disorder? Or secondary to depression.\n\nAlso, the subdural hematoma: this is a medical condition, but in psychiatry, we might consider it as a factor for neurocognitive disorders. However, he denies cognitive symptoms, so perhaps not primary.\n\nICD-10 F-codes:\n\n- Major Depressive Disorder: F33.1 for recurrent depressive disorder, current episode moderate? Or F32.9 for unspecified depressive episode. Need to specify.\n\n  - Based on symptoms: depressed mood (implied by crying, loss of purpose), anhedonia, weight loss, hypersomnia, fatigue, concentration problems. That's at least 5 symptoms, so Major Depressive Episode. Since he has a history, likely recurrent.\n\n  - ICD-10: F33.1 Recurrent depressive disorder, current episode moderate.\n\n- Alcohol Use Disorder: F10.20 for Alcohol Use Disorder, moderate or severe? History of heavy use, recent relapse. In early remission? He was sober for 7 months, so F10.21 Alcohol Use Disorder, in early remission.\n\n- Sedative overdose: He took Klonopin, which is clonazepam, a benzodiazepine. This could be F13.20 Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, unspecified. But he might not have a use disorder; it was a single event. Could be F13.929 Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use, unspecified with unspecified sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic-induced disorder. Or simpler, since it's an overdose, perhaps F13.20 for use disorder, but no evidence of ongoing misuse.\n\n  - Better to consider it as part of the clinical picture, but for diagnosis, we might list Sedative Intoxication or Overdose. DSM-5-TR has codes for substance intoxication or other substance-induced disorders.\n\n  - He was intoxicated at the time, so Sedative Intoxication: F13.929 for unspecified sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication.\n\n- Adjustment Disorder: F43.21 Adjustment disorder with depressed mood.\n\n- Sleep Disorder: F51.11 Hypersomnolence disorder, idiopathic type? Or due to another mental disorder.\n\nBut I need to choose the top 5 most likely.\n\nAnother consideration: the subdural hematoma might lead to Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Traumatic Brain Injury, but he denies symptoms, so it might be mild or not yet manifesting. But in psychiatry, we might still consider it, especially given the fall.\n\nHowever, the vignette is focused on his psychiatric presentation, and he's being admitted to inpatient psychiatry.\n\nPrioritize:\n\n1. Major Depressive Disorder (primary, as it explains most symptoms).\n\n2. Alcohol Use Disorder (significant history and recent relapse).\n\n3. Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Intoxication (from the Klonopin overdose, and he was intoxicated).\n\n4. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood (stressors with wife and work).\n\n5. Other Specified Depressive Disorder or Persistent Depressive Disorder? But Major Depressive Disorder seems fitting.\n\nPerhaps include Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (subdural hematoma) as a secondary diagnosis.\n\nList in order:\n\n- Primary: Major Depressive Disorder\n\n- Secondary: Alcohol Use Disorder\n\n- Secondary: Sedative Intoxication\n\n- Secondary: Adjustment Disorder\n\n- Secondary: Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Traumatic Brain Injury or Other Medical Condition.\n\nBut he denies cognitive symptoms, so might not be appropriate. Sleep disorder could be an option.\n\nHe has increased sleep and fatigue, which could be part of depression, but if prominent, Hypersomnolence Disorder.\n\nDSM-5-TR allows for multiple diagnoses.\n\nICD-10 codes:\n\n1. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent episode, moderate: F33.1\n\n2. Alcohol Use Disorder, in early remission: F10.21\n\n3. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication: F13.929 (but need to specify if with perceptual disturbances; he doesn't have that, so F13.929 is appropriate for unspecified intoxication).\n\n4. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood: F43.21\n\n5. Hypersomnolence disorder: F51.11\n\nBut hypersomnolence might be due to depression, so it could be coded as part of it. In DSM-5, if hypersomnia is a symptom of depression, we don't separately diagnose Hypersomnolence Disorder unless it's independent.\n\nSimilarly, for neurocognitive, since he denies symptoms, it might not be diagnosed yet.\n\nAnother option: Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder for the relationship stress, but Adjustment Disorder covers it.\n\nHe took an overdose, which could be considered Suicidal Behavior, but he denies intent. DSM-5-TR has codes for Suicidal Behavior and Non-suicidal Self-Injury. Here, it's ambiguous; he says he wasn't trying to kill himself, so might be Non-suicidal Self-Injury or Accidental Overdose.\n\nIn psychiatry, we might code it as Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention, like Problem Related to Lifestyle (Z72.9) but that's not an F-code. F-codes are for mental disorders.\n\nSo, stick to mental disorders with F-codes.\n\nRefine:\n\n1. F33.1 Recurrent depressive disorder, current episode moderate\n\n2. F10.21 Alcohol dependence, in early remission (or Alcohol Use Disorder; in ICD-10, dependence is often used, but DSM-5 uses Alcohol Use Disorder. ICD-10 has F10.20 for harmful use or dependence).\n\n  - In ICD-10, F10.2 is Alcohol dependence syndrome. For early remission, F10.21.\n\n3. F13.929 Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use, unspecified with unspecified sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic-induced disorder (for intoxication).\n\n4. F43.21 Adjustment disorder with depressed mood\n\n5. F06.31 Mood disorder due to known physiological condition (subdural hematoma)? But he's on Cymbalta for depression history, so it might be primary depression. The subdural hematoma could be a contributing factor.\n\nAlternatively, F09 Unspecified neurocognitive disorder, but not specified.\n\nPerhaps F41.9 Anxiety disorder, unspecified, for the fear of wife leaving, but no other anxiety symptoms.\n\nI think the top are depression, alcohol use, sedative intoxication, adjustment, and either sleep disorder or neurocognitive.\n\nBased on clinical expertise, in such cases, depression and substance use are primary, and the overdose is a consequence.\n\nFinal list:\n\n1. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, moderate - F33.1\n\n2. Alcohol Use Disorder, in early remission - F10.21\n\n3. Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Intoxication - F13.929\n\n4. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood - F43.21\n\n5. Other Specified Depressive Disorder? But I already have Major Depressive Disorder. Perhaps Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) if chronic, but he has a history of depression on meds, so Major Depressive Disorder is fine.\n\nAnother idea: Bereavement or something, but no.\n\nHe has loss of purpose, which might be akin to anhedonia in depression.\n\nI'll go with that list.\n\nEnsure formatting:\n\n1. <Primary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n\n2. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n\n3. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n\n4. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n\n5. <Secondary diagnosis> - ICD-10 F-code\n\nSo:\n\n1. Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent episode, moderate - F33.1\n\n2. Alcohol Use Disorder, in early remission - F10.21\n\n3. Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Intoxication - F13.929\n\n4. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood - F43.21\n\n5. Hypersomnolence Disorder - F51.11\n\nBut hypersomnolence might be part of depression, so maybe replace with something else. How about Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder for the marital discord? But Adjustment Disorder covers it.\n\nPerhaps Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Traumatic Brain Injury, mild - F06.7? In ICD-10, F06.8 is other specified mental disorders due to brain damage and dysfunction and to physical disease. For neurocognitive due to TBI, it might be under F06.\n\nICD-10 for Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Traumatic Brain Injury: F06.7 Mild neurocognitive disorder due to known physiological condition.\n\nBut he has no cognitive complaints, so it might be premature.\n\nIn the vignette, he has difficulty concentrating, but that's attributed to depression.\n\nI think Hypersomnolence Disorder is a reasonable secondary diagnosis, as it's a prominent symptom.\n\nTo be precise, in DSM-5, if hypersomnia is due to another mental disorder (depression), it's not separately diagnosed unless it's independent. So, perhaps not.\n\nAnother option: Substance\/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder, but he has a history of depression on meds, and the overdose is recent.\n\nI'll stick with the list above.",

    "model_thoughts":"Hmm, this is a complex pediatric psychiatry case requiring careful differential diagnosis. The patient presents with multiple layers of symptoms spanning developmental history, social communication deficits, restricted interests, and both motor and vocal tics.\n\nFirst, I need to extract and organize all key clinical data. The developmental timeline shows language delay (first word at 48 months), impaired social interaction (noticing peers only at 6 years), lack of response to name, repetitive movements like rocking\/spinning, and intense focus on puzzles. These strongly suggest autism spectrum disorder. The puzzle-related meltdowns indicate rigidity and need for sameness.\n\nThen there are the movement abnormalities: eye blinking at age 8, neck contortions, and current self-slapping requiring protective gloves. These appear to be complex motor tics. The racial slurs shouted in public settings seem to be complex vocal tics given their involuntary nature and stress association.\n\nThe mother explicitly denies OCD rituals, mood symptoms, psychosis, and suicidality, which helps rule out several conditions. The tics have persisted for years with changing topography, meeting chronicity criteria.\n\nFor diagnostic reasoning: The combination of social communication deficits and restricted\/repetitive behaviors clearly points to autism spectrum disorder as primary. The tic disorder is also prominent but appears secondary given the developmental history. Since both motor and vocal tics have been present for over a year, Tourette's disorder fits best rather than provisional or chronic motor-only tic disorder.\n\nThe racial slurs specifically qualify as coprolalia, which supports Tourette's. The self-slapping could be either severe tics or self-injurious behavior sometimes seen in autism, but in context of other tics, it's likely complex motor tics.\n\nOther considerations include possible OCD given repetitive behaviors, but the mother denied rituals. Anxiety disorders could explain some behaviors but wouldn't account for the full picture. The racial slurs alone might suggest disruptive behavior disorders, but their involuntary nature and association with premonitory urges make tics more likely.\n\nThe format requires listing one primary and four secondary diagnoses with F-codes. ASD should be primary given its early onset and pervasive impact. Tourette's is the most fitting secondary diagnosis for the tics. The other secondaries should include rule-outs or common comorbidities: OCD (even though denied, worth considering), anxiety disorder NOS for the stress-related tic exacerbation, and maybe a mood disorder for completeness though not strongly supported.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this. The user has given me a clinical case vignette about a 12-month-old infant named Ben and wants me to provide a structured list of DSM-5-TR diagnoses. But wait, the vignette describes physical features like wide-set eyes, low-set ears, a cat-like cry, heart issues, and hypotonia. That sounds more like a genetic or congenital syndrome rather than a primary psychiatric disorder.\n\nHmm, the user mentioned following a rubric for data extraction and diagnostic reasoning, but the instructions say not to output any clinical reasoning. Just list the top 5 diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes. But most of the symptoms here are physical. The only behavioral mention is crying when left alone, which could be separation anxiety, but that's normal for a 12-month-old.\n\nWait, the father mentioned genetic testing results are pending. The combination of cat-like cry, heart defects, feeding issues, and hypotonia strongly points to Cri-du-chat syndrome. But that's a genetic condition, not a psychiatric diagnosis. Same for the physical findings\u2014they don't map directly to DSM-5 codes.\n\nMaybe the pediatrician is referring the child for developmental delays or intellectual disability? The hypotonia and feeding issues could indicate global developmental delays. But the vignette doesn't mention specific psychiatric symptoms like mood disturbances, psychosis, or behavioral issues.\n\nLet me think about DSM-5 diagnoses that might apply. Intellectual disability could be a possibility given the multiple congenital anomalies and developmental concerns. But at 12 months, it's often diagnosed as global developmental delay first. The crying when alone might be separation anxiety disorder, but again, that's developmentally typical at this age.\n\nThe user specified to only include psychiatric diagnoses with F-codes. So I should avoid listing genetic syndromes. Instead, focus on possible psychiatric comorbidities. But the vignette doesn't provide enough behavioral or emotional symptoms to support most DSM-5 diagnoses. \n\nPerhaps the safest approach is to list diagnoses that commonly co-occur with genetic disorders, like intellectual disability and feeding disorders. But I need to base it only on the information given. The hypotonia and feeding issues might relate to a neurodevelopmental disorder. Excessive drooling could be due to hypotonia or a neurological issue.\n\nWait, the instructions say to give the top 5 most likely diagnoses. But with so little psychiatric information, it's challenging. Maybe the primary diagnosis is a neurodevelopmental disorder, and secondary diagnoses could include feeding disorder and separation anxiety. But separation anxiety at 12 months is often normal unless it's excessive.\n\nI recall that Cri-du-chat syndrome is associated with intellectual disability and developmental delays. So maybe the primary diagnosis should be intellectual disability, even though it's not explicitly stated. The small head size (microcephaly) and hypotonia support that.\n\nAlso, the heart defect and feeding issues could indicate failure to thrive or other medical conditions, but those aren't psychiatric. The user said not to include non-psychiatric diagnoses. So I need to stick to DSM-5 categories.\n\nLet me list out possible F-codes:\n- Intellectual disability (F70-F79)\n- Global developmental delay (F88)\n- Feeding or eating disorder of infancy or early childhood (F98.2)\n- Separation anxiety disorder (F93.0)\n- Other specified neurodevelopmental disorder (F88)\n\nBut are these supported? The vignette doesn't detail cognitive deficits, just physical features. Developmental delay might be inferred. Feeding problems are mentioned, so F98.2 could apply. The crying when alone might be separation anxiety, but it's not described as pathological.\n\nMaybe I should prioritize based on common comorbidities in genetic syndromes. Intellectual disability is very common in Cri-du-chat. Feeding disorders are also frequent. Hypotonia might relate to a motor disorder, but that's not specifically psychiatric.\n\nThe user emphasized using only the information provided. So I shouldn't assume intellectual disability without direct evidence. But the combination of microcephaly, hypotonia, and congenital anomalies strongly suggests it.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to list diagnoses that are most plausible given the physical symptoms and the father's concerns. But I need to ensure each diagnosis has a corresponding ICD-10 F-code and is within DSM-5-TR.\n\nAfter reconsidering, I think the primary diagnosis should be a neurodevelopmental disorder related to the genetic condition. But since the genetic results are pending, it might be unspecified. Alternatively, global developmental delay is often used for young children with delays across domains.\n\nLet me check DSM-5: Global developmental delay (F88) is for under 5s when clinical severity cannot be reliably assessed. That might fit here. Intellectual disability (F79) requires both intellectual and adaptive deficits, which aren't detailed here.\n\nFeeding disorder is mentioned, so that's valid. Separation anxiety might be a stretch. Other possible secondary diagnoses could include anxiety disorder due to another medical condition, but the vignette doesn't describe anxiety symptoms.\n\nMaybe I should include unspecified neurodevelopmental disorder as a placeholder. But the user wants the top 5 most likely. With limited psychiatric data, it's tough to fill five slots.\n\nWait, the rubric mentioned sophisticated reasoning, but the instructions say not to output reasoning. So I need to just list the diagnoses without explanation. But internally, I'm trying to justify each choice.\n\nUltimately, I'll go with what seems most supported: global developmental delay as primary, then feeding disorder, separation anxiety (though cautious), and maybe other neurodevelopmental issues. But I need five diagnoses. Perhaps adjustment disorder if the child is stressed by medical procedures, but that's not mentioned.\n\nAlternatively, the cat-like cry and heart defect are key features of Cri-du-chat, which is genetic. So the psychiatric diagnoses would be comorbidities. I think I have to go with the developmental and feeding issues as the main psychiatric concerns here.",

Collin is 13, with onset of symptoms about a week ago. He shows sadness, anhedonia (not playing video games, avoiding friends), low energy, poor concentration, appetite loss, and passive suicidal ideation. There's also irritability, anger, property destruction, and bullying. Notably, there's a psychosocial stressor (father's job loss and impending move). No mania, psychosis, trauma, substance use, or anxiety reported.\n\nFor diagnostic reasoning, the primary symptoms align with a depressive episode. Given the duration (one week) and presence of suicidal ideation, Major Depressive Disorder seems most likely. The irritability and behavioral issues could suggest Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, but the onset at age 13 is too late for DMDD, which requires onset before age 10. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood is also plausible due to the stressor, but the severity of symptoms (suicidal ideation, functional impairment) leans toward MDD.\n\nOther differentials include Persistent Depressive Disorder, but the episode is too recent.

    "vignette":"The patient is a 25-year-old male who presented with delayed responses and was vaping during intake. He currently works full-time managing his hot tub repair company and lives with his girlfriend. His medical history includes multiple substance addictions, particularly opioids (requiring Suboxone and later Methadone treatment), and previous diagnoses of OCD, ADHD, anxiety disorder, and depressive disorder. He reports a significant history of head trauma (8 concussions), one seizure episode while incarcerated, and multiple incarcerations for offenses including gun possession, burglary, and vehicle theft. His psychiatric medication history includes Adderall, Concerta, Zoloft, an unspecified antidepressant, and Trazodone. The chief complaint involves symptoms that began at approximately age 18 during his first incarceration and have intensified in the past year, coinciding with work stress. Problematic behaviors include arranging items in specific places with extreme rigidity (unable to buy new items that don't have a \"place\"), performing rituals in sets of three, and a specific handwashing ritual. He experiences intrusive thoughts about harming others (particularly fears of stabbing, shooting, or raping strangers) and engages in compulsive behaviors (brushing his hand from hairline to ear three times) to alleviate associated anxiety. He also reports persistent checking behaviors due to memory doubts, a need for things to feel \"just right\", and specific ordering rituals. Additionally, he endorses current anhedonia, decreased appetite, fatigue, and concentration difficulties that wax and wane every few months. He shared that these symptoms are distressing, though mildly impairing in his social, work, and leisurely activities. He denies current suicidality, self-harm, or hallucinations\/delusions. He reports a childhood history of conduct problems (skipping school, lying, stealing, fighting) and adult behaviors including illegal activities, irresponsibility, deceitfulness (e.g., using fake identifications) and reported guiltlessness after harming others or damaging property. His childhood conduct problems (e.g., fighting) have resulting in the concussions reported in the medical history, and his illegal activities have resulted in two incarcerations. When asked about one such activity (stealing a car), he reported no remorse, instead blaming the victim for calling the police.

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let's break this down. The patient is a 25-year-old male with a complex history. First, I need to extract and organize the key clinical details systematically. He has multiple substance addictions, especially opioids, treated with Suboxone and Methadone, which points toward Opioid Use Disorder. His medical history includes head trauma and a seizure, but those aren't psychiatric diagnoses, so I'll focus on the behavioral and emotional symptoms.\n\nLooking at the chief complaint: symptoms started around age 18 during his first incarceration and worsened in the past year with work stress. There are clear obsessive-compulsive symptoms: arranging items rigidly, rituals in sets of three, handwashing, intrusive thoughts about harming others (stabbing, shooting, raping), and compulsive behaviors to reduce anxiety. That strongly suggests Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The distress and impairment, though mild, support this.\n\nHe also reports depressive symptoms: anhedonia, decreased appetite, fatigue, concentration issues that wax and wane every few months. These episodic symptoms could indicate a depressive disorder, possibly Persistent Depressive Disorder or Major Depressive Disorder, but given the waxing and waning, maybe it's secondary to OCD or another condition.\n\nHis childhood history includes conduct problems (skipping school, lying, stealing, fighting), and as an adult, illegal activities, deceitfulness, lack of remorse, blaming others. These are classic signs of Antisocial Personality Disorder, especially since the behaviors started in childhood and persisted into adulthood, affecting multiple areas of life. He mentions not wanting to go back to jail, which shows some behavioral control but doesn't negate the personality traits.\n\nPrevious diagnoses include OCD, ADHD, anxiety, and depressive disorders. ADHD is likely given his history and medication use (Adderall, Concerta), but the vignette doesn't detail current ADHD symptoms beyond concentration issues, which could be due to depression or OCD. However, since it's a past diagnosis and he's on stimulants, it should be considered.\n\nAnxiety disorder is mentioned, but OCD might be the primary anxiety-related condition here. The substance use history is significant, especially opioid addiction requiring medication-assisted treatment, so Opioid Use Disorder is a key diagnosis.\n\nNow, organizing the data: The OCD symptoms are prominent and distressing, making it the primary diagnosis. Antisocial Personality Disorder is evident from childhood conduct issues and adult behaviors. Depressive symptoms are present but episodic, so Persistent Depressive Disorder or Other Specified Depressive Disorder might fit. ADHD is historical but supported by medication use. Opioid Use Disorder is clear from the substance history.\n\nFor the differential, I'll prioritize OCD as primary due to the severity and description of symptoms. Then Antisocial Personality Disorder, given the pervasive pattern. Depressive symptoms could be a separate disorder or specifier, but since they wax and wane, maybe Other Specified Depressive Disorder. ADHD and Opioid Use Disorder round out the top five.\n\nICD-10 codes: OCD is F42, Antisocial Personality Disorder is F60.2, Other Specified Depressive Disorder is F32.8, ADHD is F90.9, Opioid Use Disorder is F11.20. Need to ensure the codes are accurate based on DSM-5-TR equivalents.",

He presents with severe symptoms characterized primarily by intrusive thoughts related to morality, contamination, and harm. Unwanted thoughts include fears of transmitting sexual fluids to others (which he believes would make him \"a rapist\"), concerns about accidentally killing insects, moral distress about consuming animal products, and beliefs that viewing violent media constitutes \"condoning\" violence. To manage these thoughts, he engages in extensive reassurance seeking, repeatedly checking lab results at work, avoiding video games and television, dietary restrictions, and some handwashing. He reports these symptoms significantly interfere with daily functioning, preventing him from living independently. They cause intense distress that frequently culminates in panic attacks. Patient has a complex history related to his gender identity, reporting he has identified as male throughout his life despite being assigned female at birth. He is currently taking low-dose testosterone but conceals this from his family, who he believes are interfering with his plans for gender-affirming surgeries. He reported childhood \"delusions\" about being \"from a fantasy world and chosen by gods\" that resolved by age 18. Patient previously took fluvoxamine for panic symptoms until approximately age 24, reporting significant symptom exacerbation upon discontinuation. He describes himself as introverted with limited social connections, identifying as asexual, though questioning if this might be avoidance related to triggering thoughts. His social anxiety dates back to middle and high school, when he was \"pretty much mute\" with few friends. Patient describes his mood as \"always a little depressed\" with recent intensification. He endorses feeling sad, empty, and hopeless most days, anhedonia, sleep disturbances, psychomotor retardation, fatigue, worthlessness, guilt, concentration difficulties, and suicidal ideation. He frequently believes he \"needs to be dead\" and that suicide would be \"the moral thing to do\" following morally repugnant intrusive thoughts, though he denies current plan or intent (estimating a 5% chance of suicide within three months). He struggles with activities of daily living without parental support and expresses frustration that his thoughts and behaviors interfere with his gender expression. Despite these significant symptoms, he demonstrates good insight, noting that his thoughts are not consistent with who he is and what he values.",

Their psychiatric history includes diagnoses of MDD and GAD at age 15-16, PTSD in 2016 following emotional abuse by high school friends, and ADHD in 2018 (without neuropsychological evaluation). Current medications include Lisdexamfetamine 50mg (since 2018), various supplements, and a contraceptive injection. They previously tried multiple antidepressants (2011-2015) but discontinued each after approximately two weeks due to suicidal ideation and, in one case, motor disturbances. The patient consumes alcohol socially (3-5 drinks monthly) and has been vaping marijuana 1-3 times weekly for three months primarily to aid sleep and manage anxiety. The patient's primary symptoms onset around age 5 with intrusive visualizations of falling down stairs along with perfectionism through rewriting notes until they felt \"just right\". Currently, they experience significant distress when surroundings are not in the \"right spot\", spending up to 12 hours reorganizing belongings without breaks, which would cause severe distress if interrupted. This \"not just right\" feeling impairs their ability to meet deadlines, complete job applications, and fulfill social obligations. They also engage in checking behaviors when packing (counting socks repeatedly, checking for essential items) and experience distressing sexual intrusive thoughts.

    "vignette":"The patient is an 18-year-old non-binary college freshman with a complex psychiatric presentation. They report a history of childhood anxiety, perfectionism, and ritualistic self-punishment behaviors starting in the third grade. Currently, their most debilitating symptom is anxiety about \"contaminated air\" when others cough or sneeze, prompting them to cover their face and hold their breath even when the trigger is far away or on television. They engage in checking and counting behaviors based on the number 3, including checking mirrors while driving, locking\/unlocking their car, and tapping their toothbrush. These compulsions are experienced as uncontrollable, with the patient reporting they sometimes modify behaviors (like holding an imaginary door handle in their pocket) when the original compulsion would be disruptive. At approximately age 16, the patient developed anorexia nervosa, restricting their food intake and ultimately requiring intervention from parents and a treatment team. Despite gaining weight under external pressure, the patient continues to restrict eating, has a distinct fear of gaining weight, becoming fat, fasting until dinner, drinking coffee to intentionally upset their stomach. Their BMI currently falls within the normal range. Around the same time their eating disorder developed, the patient experienced depressive symptoms including hopelessness, low motivation, and self-harm behaviors (pulling hair, cutting, punching stomach). They had suicidal ideation during high school, including thoughts of jumping in front of a train and fantasizing about wandering into hallways during a school shooting. Current suicidal thoughts are less frequent and persistent. Current depressive symptoms have been subsyndromal (though not entirely absent) for about 7 months.

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let's start by carefully reading the vignette and extracting all the key clinical details. The patient is 18, non-binary, a college freshman. They have a history of childhood anxiety, perfectionism, and ritualistic self-punishment since third grade. Current symptoms include anxiety about contaminated air from coughs or sneezes, leading to covering face and holding breath even with distant triggers like TV. There are checking and counting behaviors based on the number 3\u2014checking mirrors while driving, locking\/unlocking car, tapping toothbrush. These feel uncontrollable, and they adapt behaviors to avoid disruption.\n\nAt age 16, anorexia nervosa developed with food restriction, fear of weight gain, and ongoing behaviors like fasting until dinner and using coffee to upset stomach. BMI is normal now due to external pressure. Around the same time, depressive symptoms emerged: hopelessness, low motivation, self-harm (hair pulling, cutting, punching stomach), and past suicidal ideation with specific plans. Current suicidal thoughts are less frequent, depressive symptoms are subsyndromal for about 7 months, with brief episodes every few weeks. They rate self-harm risk as 50% but suicide attempt chance at 0%. Minimal substance use. Resistance to treatment due to fear of weight gain and need to \"stay sad.\"\n\nNow, organizing this data logically. The main clusters are obsessive-compulsive symptoms, eating disorder, depressive symptoms, and self-harm\/suicidality. There's also a history of anxiety and perfectionism. The timeline shows OCD-like behaviors starting in childhood, anorexia and depression around 16, with current OCD symptoms still prominent, eating disorder behaviors ongoing, and depressive symptoms in partial remission but with ongoing self-harm risk.\n\nFor differential diagnosis, the primary issue seems to be obsessive-compulsive disorder given the intrusive thoughts about contamination and compulsions involving checking, counting, and tapping. The eating disorder meets criteria for anorexia nervosa, restricting type, as there's persistent restriction, fear of weight gain, and behaviors to prevent weight gain despite normal BMI. Depressive symptoms were present but are now subsyndromal, so major depressive disorder might be in partial remission or as a past diagnosis. However, current self-harm risk is high, so it's still relevant. The self-harm behaviors like hair pulling could indicate excoriation or trichotillomania, but they're part of a broader pattern of self-injury possibly related to depression or OCD. The patient's resistance to treatment and fear of weight gain complicate the eating disorder diagnosis, but it's still active. Considering the hierarchy, OCD and anorexia are both prominent, but OCD seems more pervasive and longstanding. The vignette mentions the compulsions are debilitating, so OCD might be primary. However, anorexia often co-occurs, and the patient's resistance to treatment is tied to it. Depressive disorder could be secondary due to the eating disorder or OCD. I should also consider other anxiety disorders, but the specific obsessions and compulsions point to OCD. Substance use is minimal, so no substance use disorder. The self-harm behaviors might indicate non-suicidal self-injury as a separate condition, but it's often part of other disorders. Trichotillomania is a possibility given hair pulling, but it might be part of OCD or depression. Excoriation disorder is another if skin picking is present, but the vignette mentions cutting and punching, not specifically picking. So, the top diagnoses are OCD, anorexia nervosa, major depressive disorder in partial remission, and possible non-suicidal self-injury or other specified disruptive, impulse-control, or conduct disorder for the self-harm. Alternatively, other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder could include trichotillomania if hair pulling is significant. But the primary is likely OCD given the detailed compulsions and obsessions. Anorexia is also severe and ongoing. Depressive disorder is historical but with residual symptoms. The self-harm risk is current, so it needs to be coded. I'll go with OCD as primary due to the debilitating nature and early onset, then anorexia, then major depressive disorder, then non-suicidal self-injury as other specified disorder, and finally trichotillomania or other related disorder. However, the vignette says pulling hair as self-harm, which could be trichotillomania if it's hair pulling disorder, but it's listed as self-harm, so maybe it's part of the depressive or OCD symptoms. I'll check DSM-5-TR codes. OCD is F42, anorexia is F50.00 or F50.01, major depressive disorder is F33.x depending on episode, but since it's in partial remission, maybe F33.41 if recurrent. For self-harm, non-suicidal self-injury is under F45.8 as other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, or as other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder F91.8. But trichotillomania is F63.3. The patient also has checking behaviors, which are classic OCD. So primary OCD, secondary anorexia, secondary major depressive disorder in partial remission, secondary non-suicidal self-injury, and secondary trichotillomania if hair pulling is separate. However, the hair pulling might be part of OCD or depression. Given the complexity, I'll prioritize based on the vignette's emphasis. The contaminant fear and compulsions are highlighted as most debilitating, so OCD primary. Anorexia is explicitly mentioned and ongoing. Depression is subsyndromal but with history. Self-harm is current risk. So list: 1. OCD, 2. Anorexia nervosa, restricting type, 3. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, in partial remission, 4. Non-suicidal self-injury, 5. Trichotillomania. But non-suicidal self-injury isn't a separate DSM-5 diagnosis; it's under other conditions. In DSM-5-TR, non-suicidal self-injury is listed as a condition for further study, not a formal diagnosis. So maybe use other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder for self-harm behaviors. Alternatively, other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder for trichotillomania-like symptoms. But trichotillomania is a separate diagnosis if hair pulling is recurrent despite attempts to stop. The vignette says pulling hair as self-harm, so it might not meet trichotillomania criteria if it's for self-harm rather than tension relief. I need to be precise. Let's stick to formal diagnoses. So: OCD, anorexia nervosa, major depressive disorder, and then for self-harm, perhaps other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder. And the fifth could be other specified anxiety disorder for the childhood anxiety, but that's historical. The vignette mentions childhood anxiety, but current is OCD. So maybe no. Alternatively, other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder for the ritualistic self-punishment? But that's part of OCD. Hmm. I think the top three are clear. Fourth could be other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder for self-harm. Fifth might be other specified feeding or eating disorder if anorexia is atypical, but it seems classic. Or other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder for the counting rituals, but that's OCD. I think I'll go with the list as above. Let's finalize.",

She recently transitioned from working as a childcare specialist to self-employment as a freelancer. Her medical history includes anemia and IBS, for which she takes daily iron supplements. The patient previously attempted treatment with Zoloft (10mg) for OCD symptoms but discontinued due to emotional blunting effects. She reports consuming alcohol 1-2 glasses a few times monthly and using marijuana daily when available, which she finds helpful for intrusive thoughts despite occasionally triggering anxiety. The patient's most distressing symptoms involve intrusive thoughts about sexually harming children, accompanied by physiological responses that she describes as \"groinal\". These thoughts were particularly distressing during her work as a childcare specialist, where she engaged in compulsive staring at children's genital areas to \"prove\" she wasn't sexually attracted to them and sometimes avoided changing diapers due to fear of sexual arousal. After experiencing an intrusive dream about sexually harming her brother in January 2021, she experienced physical symptoms (shaking, freezing) when interacting with him and subsequently increased their time together as a form of reassurance. Additionally, the patient reports significant health anxiety focused on getting cancer, HIV, and STIs, leading to excessive symptom research. The patient experiences panic attacks (1-2 times monthly) lasting 15-30 minutes when triggered by intrusive thoughts, with symptoms including shortness of breath, crying, sweating, racing heart, chest pain, and feelings of detachment. She reports seeking reassurance from her mother when these thoughts become overwhelming. The patient also endorses distressing and functionally impairing social anxiety in small groups, leading to significant avoidance; however, she stated that this anxiety is primary due to her unwanted\/intrusive thoughts rather than a fear of being judged. She reports experiencing over 50 depressive episodes in the past year, each lasting at least two weeks with symptoms including decreased appetite, sleep disturbance, fatigue, guilt, concentration difficulties, and thoughts of death. She described these episodes as challenging to manage, but \"not completely debilitating\".",

    "model_thoughts":"Hmm, this is a complex clinical vignette with multiple overlapping symptoms. Let me start by extracting and organizing the key information systematically. The patient is a 22-year-old female with pre-existing depression, anxiety, and OCD diagnoses. The most prominent symptoms involve intrusive thoughts about harming children with accompanying compulsive behaviors like staring and avoidance. She also has health anxiety, panic attacks, social anxiety, and recurrent depressive episodes.\n\nOkay, looking at the diagnostic reasoning, the intrusive thoughts with compulsive behaviors clearly point toward OCD as the primary issue. The thoughts are ego-dystonic, cause distress, and lead to compulsions\u2014classic OCD presentation. The health anxiety could be part of OCD or a separate illness anxiety disorder, but given the existing OCD diagnosis, it's likely a manifestation of the same condition.\n\nThe panic attacks seem triggered by intrusive thoughts rather than spontaneous, so panic disorder might not be the best fit. The social anxiety is explicitly linked to intrusive thoughts too, so it's likely secondary. The depressive episodes are recurrent but not fully debilitating, so persistent depressive disorder might be more appropriate than major depression.\n\nSubstance use is present but doesn't appear to be causing the primary symptoms. The marijuana use might even be a form of self-medication for the intrusive thoughts. Rule-outs would include other anxiety and trauma-related disorders, but the core features align most strongly with OCD.",

He lives with his biological parents and seven-year-old brother, with whom he has \"constant\" conflict including arguing, screaming, and hitting. Erik has a developmental history of severe temper tantrums prior to age 4, with behavioral challenges emerging in kindergarten and worsening in subsequent grades. His mother reports that her son engages in \"constant defiance\", experiences rapid mood changes, and demonstrates impulsive behavior, including occasional incidents of pulling knives (though never pointing them at anyone). Daily arguments at home frequently escalate to physical aggression, particularly with his mother and brother. Erik has expressed statements such as \"I wish I could go to sleep and never wake up\" and reports feeling depressed \"randomly\" a couple times per month since second or third grade, though he denies daily depressive symptoms or changes in sleep or appetite. Erik's behavioral difficulties have manifested in both home and school environments. In school, he has engaged in speaking out of turn, refusing to follow directions, agitating teachers, and having \"screaming matches\" with staff. Despite these challenges, Erik maintains high grades across subjects (with math being his most difficult class at a B), has several friends, and is described as a leader in social interactions. He has a Section 504 plan that allows for movement opportunities and frequent breaks when needed. In March 2019, Erik began taking 2mg of Guanfacine (extended release) for attention\/concentration deficits, which has helped reduce impulsivity and improve behavioral control, though aggressive and defiant behaviors have continued. His mother reports implementing a point system for rewards and consequences but notes limited effectiveness due to inconsistent expectations between parents. Formal assessment indicates that Erik demonstrates a pattern of emotional dysregulation, defiance, and aggressive behavior, with physical aggression occurring approximately every other day at home. Assessment also confirms prior symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, which are present across settings and contribute to emotional dysregulation and academic underperformance relative to ability.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the vignette about Erik. He's a 10-year-old male with a history of severe temper tantrums before age 4, and behavioral issues that started in kindergarten and got worse. The key points are constant defiance, rapid mood changes, impulsivity, and physical aggression at home, especially towards his mother and brother. He's pulled knives but never pointed them at anyone.\n\nHe also expresses occasional depressive thoughts, like wishing he could sleep and never wake up, and feels depressed randomly a couple times a month since second or third grade. However, he denies daily depressive symptoms or changes in sleep or appetite. So the depressive symptoms seem episodic, not persistent.\n\nAt school, he has behavioral issues like speaking out of turn, refusing directions, agitating teachers, and screaming matches. But he maintains high grades, has friends, and is a social leader. There's a Section 504 plan for movement breaks. He's on Guanfacine for attention\/concentration deficits, which helps with impulsivity but not the aggression or defiance.\n\nThe assessment mentions emotional dysregulation, defiance, aggression, and prior symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity across settings. So there's a clear pattern of behavioral issues both at home and school, but with some academic and social strengths.\n\nNow, considering DSM-5-TR diagnoses, the primary issues seem to be disruptive behaviors, emotional dysregulation, and attention problems. The most prominent is the aggression, defiance, and temper outbursts. That points towards Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) or maybe Conduct Disorder (CD). Since there's physical aggression but no severe violations of others' rights like stealing or cruelty to animals, ODD seems more fitting. CD would require more severe behaviors.\n\nHe also has symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity across settings, which improved with Guanfacine. That strongly suggests ADHD, Combined Presentation, as it's present both at home and school.\n\nThe depressive symptoms are occasional, not daily, so it might be a depressive disorder, but not Major Depressive Disorder due to the episodic nature. Could be Other Specified Depressive Disorder or Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD). Given the age of onset before 10, severe temper outbursts, and persistent irritability between outbursts, DMDD fits better than intermittent depressive episodes.\n\nThe emotional dysregulation and mood changes are significant, so DMDD might be a consideration, but it requires persistent irritability or anger between outbursts, which is mentioned here. Also, the tantrums started before age 6, which is a criterion for DMDD.\n\nHe has friends and good grades, so Autism Spectrum Disorder is less likely since social communication isn't impaired. Anxiety disorders aren't mentioned, so probably not that.\n\nPutting it together, the primary diagnosis should be Oppositional Defiant Disorder because the defiance and aggression are central. Then ADHD due to the attention and impulsivity symptoms. DMDD due to the mood dysregulation and temper outbursts. The depressive symptoms might be part of DMDD or a separate unspecified depressive disorder. Since the aggression is frequent, Intermittent Explosive Disorder could be considered, but ODD already covers the aggression and defiance.\n\nPrioritizing, ODD is most prominent, then ADHD, then DMDD. The depressive episodes are secondary, so Other Specified Depressive Disorder. Maybe Adjustment Disorder, but the issues are chronic, not in response to a recent stressor. So the top five would be ODD, ADHD, DMDD, Other Specified Depressive Disorder, and maybe a rule-out for Conduct Disorder, but since there's no evidence of more severe behaviors, it's lower on the list.",

The patient reports that this behavior began at age 27 (late 2017) and involves involuntary staring at people he does not know well, with particular focus on the genitals\/breasts of all genders and ages, including children. He spends approximately six hours per day engaged in or thinking about this behavior, which he cannot control through willpower alone, though he can interrupt it by creating a physical barrier in his line of sight or wearing sunglasses. The patient initially denied but later acknowledged experiencing unwanted sexual thoughts regarding his sexual orientation. This behavior has significantly impaired his functioning, causing him to lose multiple jobs within the past year, avoid family gatherings, limit time in public, and experience relationship strain with his girlfriend of 12 years, with whom he has three children and now stays home while she works. The patient experiences moderate suicidal ideation, including thoughts that he would be better off dead, and reports feeling worthless and guilty, particularly about \"not providing for my children and for staring\".

The self-harm incident and access to guns raise safety concerns.

Brief psychotic disorder is possible but the duration isn't specified. Schizophrenia would require longer duration.

She reports that she feels her husband does not understand nor respect her because he was requesting to return home to be closer to his workplace. She states that she was surprised at the argument because he is usually a \u201cgood man.\u201d When asked what made her feel disrespected this time, she replied it was because he was refusing her request to continue staying at the hotel and that he usually never says no to her. When asked her reason for staying, she stated that she just \u201cdid not feel ready\u201d to return home yet because being around her mother-in-law stressed her out. She did not understand why her husband was not accommodating her discomfort. However, when pointing out husband\u2019s discomfort with the long commute time to work, she minimized his concern and did not acknowledge his struggle, instead redirecting the conversation to her own feelings. When asked about the reason for her disagreement with her mother-in-law, she states it is because her mother-in-law does not recognize her efforts for contributing to the household. She states that, \u201cMy mother-in-law always complains that I don\u2019t do chores and don\u2019t work. But she doesn\u2019t get it that I\u2019m the one supporting my husband at his job and that he should be the main breadwinner anyways as the husband. Besides, I did the dishes today, it\u2019s not even true that I don\u2019t do chores.\u201d When addressing the physicians, she addresses them casually (e.g. \u201cdude,\u201d \u201cman,\u201d etc.) and states to them, \u201cYou\u2019re a doctor, you should be smart enough to understand me.\u201d She denies that she has any mental issues that requires her to remain in the hospital, stating that, \u201cSmart people like us, we get misunderstood, you get it right? That\u2019s why they sent me here.\u201d She also alludes to believing that her mother-in-law called the police to have her brought here to get her away from her husband because she\u2019s \u201cjealous I get to spend more time with her son than she does.\u201d When informing her that the reason for her hospitalization was the threat of suicide, she casually waves it off, stating, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t actually want to kill myself, I just said that to get my husband to listen to me.\u201d",

The patient is a pre-adolescent male with persistent oppositional behaviors at school and home, including argumentativeness, defiance, profanity, and intentional provocation (making messes).

No clear symptoms of conduct disorder (e.g., aggression, property destruction) are noted, so ODD takes precedence.\n\nDifferential should consider other disruptive\/impulse-control disorders. Intermittent Explosive Disorder is less likely as the irritability isn't episodic. ADHD could be comorbid but isn't emphasized here.

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, the user wants me to act as an expert psychiatrist diagnosing a 15-year-old male based on a vignette. First, I need to follow the rubric for Data Extraction and Organization at Level 5. That means picking up subtle cues and patterns.\n\nLooking at the vignette: The key symptoms are irritability, anger, social withdrawal, anhedonia (loss of interest in games), fatigue, hopelessness (\"not going to amount to anything\"), and academic decline. Duration is a few months, which is significant for a depressive episode. The grandmother mentions he was different before, so it's a change from baseline.\n\nFor Diagnostic Reasoning, I need a nuanced differential. Primary consideration is Major Depressive Disorder due to depressed mood (irritability in teens), anhedonia, fatigue, and hopelessness. But since it's a teenager, I should consider other possibilities. \n\nAdjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood could fit because the symptoms started within months, but the severity and anhedonia point more towards MDD. Persistent Depressive Disorder might be considered, but the grandmother says it's a recent change, so not chronic. \n\nCould be a disruptive mood dysregulation disorder? But the irritability here seems more related to depression rather than severe temper outbursts. Substance use isn't mentioned, so rule that out. \n\nMaybe schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders? No psychotic symptoms noted, just social withdrawal and irritability. Anxiety disorders? Not highlighted here. The fatigue and boredom might point towards depression more than anything else.\n\nSo the top diagnosis is Major Depressive Disorder. Secondary ones could include Adjustment Disorder, Persistent Depressive Disorder if it turns out to be longer, maybe Oppositional Defiant Disorder given the irritability, but it's likely secondary to depression. Also, consider Other Specified Depressive Disorder if criteria aren't fully met, but here they seem to align with MDD.\n\nNeed to list F-codes. MDD would be F32.x, probably F32.9 for unspecified episode. Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood is F43.21. Persistent Depressive Disorder is F34.1. For ODD, F91.3. Maybe Unspecified Depressive Disorder as a fifth, F32.9 again? Wait, that's repetitive. Maybe Dysthymia instead? But the vignette says past few months, not years. Hmm.\n\nActually, re-read: Symptoms are past few months, so MDD single episode fits. Adjustment disorder is plausible but less likely due to anhedonia and hopelessness. ODD is possible but the irritability is tied to depressive symptoms. Maybe rule out substance-induced, but no evidence. So the list: MDD, Adjustment Disorder, Persistent Depressive Disorder, ODD, and maybe Depressive Disorder NOS or Other Specified. \n\nFormatting must be exact: primary first, then four secondaries with F-codes. Let me double-check the ICD-10 codes: MDD single episode unspecified is F32.9. Adjustment with depressed mood F43.21. Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) F34.1. Oppositional defiant disorder F91.3. For the fifth, maybe F32.8 other specified depressive episodes, but since MDD is already listed, perhaps Unspecified Mood Disorder F39? But that's vague. Alternatively, consider Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, which is F34.81. But the irritability here isn't as severe or frequent as DMDD requires. \n\nGiven the anhedonia and duration, Dysthymia is less likely because it requires two years in adults, but in children it can be one year of irritable mood. Here it's only months, so maybe not. But as a differential, it's worth listing. \n\nFinal list: 1. Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, moderate (since it's affecting school and social functioning) - F32.1. Actually, severity isn't specified, so F32.9 is safer. 2. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood - F43.21. 3. Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) - F34.1. 4. Oppositional Defiant Disorder - F91.3. 5. Other Specified Depressive Disorder - F32.8. \n\nWait, the user said top 5 most likely, so I should prioritize based on likelihood. MDD is primary, then Adjustment, then ODD, then Dysthymia, then maybe Unspecified. But ODD might be higher than Adjustment? Given the irritability and defiance, but the core seems depressive. Let's stick with MDD, Adjustment, Dysthymia, ODD, and Other Specified. That covers the bases without overcomplicating.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the vignette again to make sure I don't miss any key details. The patient is a 15-year-old boy brought in for anxiety that started seven months ago after his friend's mom passed away. The main issues seem to be excessive worry about his mom's safety when she's at work or when he's at school. He's constantly thinking about bad scenarios happening to her, which sounds like persistent, intrusive thoughts. \n\nHis anxiety is affecting his school performance\u2014grades are dropping, he's not submitting assignments on time, and he's losing friends because he's becoming more isolated. Sleep is disturbed with nightmares about his mom leaving him. He denies hallucinations, substance use, or medical issues. There's no mention of panic attacks, compulsions, or trauma-related flashbacks, which helps rule out some other disorders.\n\nThe primary concern here seems to be separation anxiety. He's excessively worried about harm coming to his mom when they're apart, which started after a triggering event (friend's mom's death). The nightmares, school avoidance, and distress when separated fit the criteria for Separation Anxiety Disorder. The duration is seven months, which is more than the required four weeks for children.\n\nNext, I need to consider differentials. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is a possibility because he has racing thoughts and can't shut his mind off, but the focus is specifically on his mom's safety, not generalized worries. Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety could apply since it started after a stressor, but the symptoms are more severe and persistent. Social Anxiety might be considered because he's feeling lonely at school, but the core fear isn't social scrutiny\u2014it's separation from his mom. Panic Disorder doesn't fit because there's no mention of panic attacks. Maybe Persistent Depressive Disorder or Major Depression since he's losing interest in school and friends, but the primary driver seems anxiety, not depressed mood or anhedonia.\n\nI should list the top five diagnoses in order of likelihood.

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the clinical vignette. The patient is a 60-year-old male with multiple medical issues, including newly diagnosed prostate cancer, and he's been admitted for cancer treatment. Psychiatry is consulted for depression. He's been hospitalized for seven days, complicated by a DVT.\n\nFirst, I need to extract all relevant information. The patient presents with dysphoric mood, constricted affect, and reports symptoms like anhedonia, hopelessness, helplessness, low energy, and low appetite since his cancer diagnosis a month ago. He attributes some symptoms like low appetite to chemotherapy-induced nausea. He's also worried about his cancer, family, finances, and estate planning. He has a past psychiatric history of anxiety during law school, managed with therapy, no psychiatric medications or prior psychiatrist visits. No prior depression before the cancer diagnosis.\n\nNow, organizing this data: the onset of depressive symptoms is clearly linked to the stress of the cancer diagnosis. The symptoms have been present for about a month, which aligns with the timeline of the diagnosis. He meets several criteria for a depressive episode: depressed mood, anhedonia, fatigue, appetite changes. However, the appetite issue might be partly due to chemotherapy, so I need to consider that. The worry about cancer and future planning points to significant anxiety, which could be part of an adjustment disorder or a separate anxiety condition.\n\nConsidering differential diagnoses: the primary issue seems to be a depressive episode in the context of a medical condition. Since the symptoms started after the cancer diagnosis, Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood is a strong candidate. However, the severity and number of symptoms might also meet criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. Given the medical context, Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (prostate cancer) is another possibility. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, so Generalized Anxiety Disorder or Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety could be considered. Past history of anxiety, though distant, might indicate a predisposition. Also, the medical conditions themselves (cancer, DVT) and treatments (chemotherapy) could contribute to mood symptoms, so that needs to be factored in.\n\nNow, prioritizing the top five diagnoses. The primary diagnosis should be the most fitting based on DSM-5-TR criteria. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood seems appropriate because the symptoms are a reaction to the stressor (cancer diagnosis) and have occurred within three months. However, the symptoms are significant, so Major Depressive Disorder is also plausible. But since the patient didn't have depression before and it's directly linked to the stressor, Adjustment Disorder might be more accurate. Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition is possible, but the temporal relationship to the stressor rather than the medical condition itself might make Adjustment Disorder more likely.\n\nSecondary diagnoses: Anxiety related to the medical condition, Generalized Anxiety Disorder given the excessive worry, and possibly Other Specified Depressive Disorder if it doesn't fully meet MDD criteria. Also, considering the past history of anxiety, it might be relevant to include that as a historical diagnosis, but since it's past and controlled, maybe not a current secondary diagnosis. Instead, focusing on current conditions: Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood could be an option since both depression and anxiety are present.\n\nWait, the patient has dysphoria, anhedonia, hopelessness, low energy, appetite change. That's at least five symptoms of depression, which could meet MDD criteria. But the vignette says it started after the diagnosis, so it might be better categorized as Adjustment Disorder if the symptoms are disproportionate or cause significant impairment. However, MDD can also be triggered by stressors. I need to check if the symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment. The patient is concerned about multiple aspects of his life, which suggests impairment.\n\nAlso, the appetite change is attributed to chemotherapy nausea, so that might not count as a neurovegetative symptom for MDD if it's due to another cause. That could affect the diagnosis. So perhaps Adjustment Disorder is more appropriate.\n\nFor ICD-10 codes: Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood is F43.21. If considering mixed anxiety and depression, F43.23. Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, would be F32.9. Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition would be F06.31. Generalized Anxiety Disorder is F41.1. Other Specified Depressive Disorder could be F32.89.\n\nNow, listing top five: Primary: Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood. Secondary: Major Depressive Disorder (if symptoms are severe enough), Depressive Disorder Due to Prostate Cancer, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Other Specified Anxiety Disorder if GAD isn't fully met. But since the anxiety is focused on the cancer, it might be part of the adjustment disorder.\n\nPerhaps the primary is Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood given both symptoms are present. The patient has depression and anxiety about cancer, family, finances. So F43.23. Then secondary: Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, moderate (if considering the severity), Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and maybe Unspecified Anxiety Disorder if not meeting full GAD criteria.\n\nBut I need to base it only on the vignette. The anxiety is related to the cancer, so it might not be generalized across multiple areas. GAD requires excessive anxiety about various events, not just one. Here, the worry is focused on cancer and its consequences, so perhaps Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood covers both.\n\nAlso, the past history of anxiety might indicate a predisposition, but since it's past and controlled, it's not a current diagnosis. So I shouldn't include it as a current secondary diagnosis.\n\nFinalizing: Primary: Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood. Secondary: Major Depressive Disorder, Depressive Disorder Due to Prostate Cancer, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (if the worry extends beyond the cancer), and Other Specified Depressive Disorder if MDD criteria aren't fully met. But I think MDD is plausible, so I'll include it.\n\nNow, for codes: \n1. Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood - F43.23\n2. Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, unspecified - F32.9\n3. Depressive Disorder Due to Prostate Cancer - F06.31\n4. Generalized Anxiety Disorder - F41.1\n5. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder - F41.8\n\nBut is GAD appropriate? The worry is about cancer, which is a real threat, so it might not be excessive or unrealistic. Therefore, Adjustment Disorder already covers it. Maybe replace GAD with Unspecified Depressive Disorder or something else.\n\nPerhaps the secondary should include Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition. Since the anxiety is related to cancer, that could be F06.4. Yes, that makes sense. So:\n2. Major Depressive Disorder - F32.9\n3. Depressive Disorder Due to Prostate Cancer - F06.31\n4. Anxiety Disorder Due to Prostate Cancer - F06.4\n5. Other Specified Depressive Disorder - F32.89\n\nBut I need to prioritize the most likely. Given the vignette, Adjustment Disorder is most likely because the symptoms are a reaction to the stressor. MDD is possible but might be less accurate if the symptoms are directly tied to the stressor and medical condition. However, DSM-5 allows MDD even with a stressor, so it's still a consideration.\n\nI think the primary should be Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood. Then, since the patient has medical conditions contributing, Depressive and Anxiety Disorders Due to Another Medical Condition are important to consider. Major Depressive Disorder is also a key differential. For the fifth, maybe Unspecified Depressive Disorder, but Other Specified might be better.\n\nWait, the patient has low appetite due to chemotherapy nausea, which might not be a symptom of depression if it's solely due to nausea. So that could affect MDD diagnosis. Therefore, Adjustment Disorder might be more fitting. So I'll go with that.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the clinical vignette to extract all relevant information. The patient is a 25-year-old male with a history of hypertension and past psychiatric history of psychosis. He's presenting with auditory hallucinations that started a year ago, evolving from whispers to louder, comprehensible voices making negative remarks. He's socially isolating, lost his job due to unexcused absences, and had to move back with his parents. \n\nHe denies current depression but mentions a past episode of elevated mood lasting a couple of weeks where he needed less sleep, had increased energy, productivity, sociability, and rapid speech. Others noticed a change in him. During that period, he was still hearing voices. His current mental status shows tangential speech, internal preoccupation, and poor hygiene.\n\nFirst, I need to organize the key symptoms. The auditory hallucinations are prominent, lasting a year, with negative content. There's social withdrawal and functional decline (job loss). The past episode of elevated mood with decreased need for sleep, increased energy, and pressured speech suggests a manic episode. The presence of psychosis during that episode is notable.\n\nNow, considering differential diagnoses. The primary diagnosis should account for both psychotic symptoms and the manic episode. Schizoaffective Disorder fits because there's a major mood episode (mania) concurrent with ongoing psychotic symptoms outside the mood episode. The psychosis (voices) persisted even during the manic phase, which aligns with Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type.\n\nNext, Schizophrenia is a possibility given the psychotic symptoms for a year, but the clear manic episode rules out pure schizophrenia. Bipolar I Disorder with Psychotic Features is another consideration because the manic episode lasted a couple of weeks, meeting duration criteria, and psychosis was present during mania. However, the psychosis continues outside the mood episode, which leans more towards Schizoaffective Disorder.\n\nSchizophreniform Disorder is less likely since symptoms have lasted a year, exceeding the 6-month threshold for schizophrenia. Other specified schizophrenia spectrum disorder could be considered if the symptoms don't fully meet criteria for the above, but the vignette provides enough for a more specific diagnosis.\n\nSubstance-induced psychotic disorder should be ruled out, but there's no mention of substance use. Similarly, medical causes like hypertension affecting psychosis aren't indicated here. The past medical history of hypertension might be a red herring unless it's causing issues, but no evidence is provided.\n\nPrioritizing the diagnoses: Schizoaffective Disorder is primary due to concurrent mood and psychotic symptoms. Bipolar I Disorder with Psychotic Features is secondary because the manic episode is clear, but the ongoing psychosis outside mood episodes makes it less fitting. Schizophrenia is third as psychosis is prominent but the manic episode suggests a mood component. Then, other specified schizophrenia spectrum disorder and substance-induced psychosis as rule-outs, though substance use isn't mentioned.\n\nNeed to ensure each diagnosis has an ICD-10 F-code. Schizoaffective Disorder is F25.0 for bipolar type. Bipolar I Disorder with psychotic features is F31.2 if manic, F31.5 if depressed, but here it's manic, so F31.2. Schizophrenia is F20.9. Other specified schizophrenia spectrum disorder is F28. Substance-induced psychotic disorder would be F1x.5, but since no substance is indicated, maybe F29 for unspecified psychosis as a placeholder, but better to use F28 for other specified.\n\nWait, the rubric says top 5 most likely diagnoses. So primary and four secondaries. Make sure they're psychiatric only with F-codes. Don't include non-psychiatric. Also, no reasoning in the response, just the list. So the list should be:\n\n1. Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type - F25.0\n2. Bipolar I Disorder, Current or Most Recent Episode Manic with Psychotic Features - F31.2\n3. Schizophrenia - F20.9\n4. Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder - F28\n5. Substance\/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder (though no substance mentioned, but as a rule-out) - F19.959 (if unspecified substance) but better to use F29 for Unspecified Psychosis? However, the vignette doesn't mention substances, so maybe avoid substance-induced unless implied. Alternatively, consider Delusional Disorder, but not fitting. Maybe Brief Psychotic Disorder, but duration is too long. So F29 for Unspecified Psychosis as a last resort.\n\nBut the instruction says \"based only on information provided,\" so since no substance use is mentioned, maybe exclude that. However, in clinical practice, it's a common differential. But strictly following the vignette, perhaps Schizoaffective, Bipolar, Schizophrenia, Other Specified, and then Delusional Disorder? But delusions aren't highlighted here. Hmm.\n\nLooking back, the patient has hallucinations, not prominent delusions. So Delusional Disorder isn't fitting. Maybe Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition, but hypertension isn't likely causing this. So maybe F06.2 for psychotic disorder due to hypertension? But the vignette doesn't suggest a direct link, and past medical history includes hypertension, but no indication it's causing psychosis. So probably not.\n\nStick with Schizoaffective as primary, Bipolar with psychosis, Schizophrenia, Other Specified, and then Unspecified Psychosis as the fifth. Or maybe Substance-Induced is still a consideration even if not mentioned, but better to include only based on given info. The vignette says \"base your answer only on the information provided,\" so avoid assuming substance use.\n\nThus, final list:\n1. Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type - F25.0\n2. Bipolar I Disorder, Current Episode Manic with Psychotic Features - F31.2\n3. Schizophrenia - F20.9\n4. Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder - F28\n5. Unspecified Psychosis - F29\n\nBut is Unspecified Psychosis appropriate when more specific diagnoses are available? Maybe as a last resort. Alternatively, consider Schizophreniform Disorder, but duration is 1 year, so exceeds 6 months. So not applicable.\n\nPerhaps Brief Psychotic Disorder, but duration too long. So F29 is okay. Or Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition, but no evidence. So F29.\n\nNeed to ensure ICD-10 codes are correct. F25.0 for schizoaffective bipolar type. F31.2 for bipolar I manic with psychotic features. F20.9 for schizophrenia. F28 for other specified. F29 for unspecified.\n\nYes, that seems reasonable. Now, structure the response as requested.",

    "reasoning":"Catatonia Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition: here, encephalitis post COVID infection",
    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the vignette. The patient is a 20-year-old African American male with no prior psychiatric history. He presented with a one-week history of abnormal behavior, depressed mood, and headaches. He was functioning well until symptoms started. Important point: he tested positive for COVID-19 one month prior. Initial symptoms were anxiety, insomnia, depressed mood, headache, which quickly progressed to auditory hallucinations, paranoia, and functional impairment. That sounds like an acute onset of psychotic and mood symptoms.\n\nThen on the third day of psychiatric hospitalization, he became selectively mute, immobile, refused oral intake. That's catatonic features. He also developed a low-grade fever and right arm twitching, which might indicate neurological involvement. Medications like haloperidol, olanzapine didn't work, which is notable because typical antipsychotics often aren't effective in certain conditions like catatonia or autoimmune encephalitis. \n\nHe was transferred to neurology. Workup showed normal labs, brain imaging, EEG showed moderate encephalopathy without seizures. Autoimmune encephalitis was considered but not confirmed. He partially responded to benzodiazepines, which is a key point because benzodiazepines are often effective for catatonia. Gradual improvement led to full recovery within a month.\n\nSo, the main features are: acute onset after COVID-19, psychotic symptoms (auditory hallucinations, paranoia), mood symptoms (depressed mood, anxiety), catatonia (mutism, immobility, refusal to eat), neurological symptoms (headache, fever, twitching), no response to antipsychotics but response to benzodiazepines, and full recovery within a month. \n\nConsidering the timeline after COVID-19, the neurological symptoms, and the psychiatric presentation, this might be a neuropsychiatric condition post-infection. Given the catatonic features, response to benzodiazepines, and acute onset, Catatonic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition seems primary. The medical condition here would be the post-COVID-19 state or possible unspecified encephalitis.\n\nDifferential diagnoses should include other conditions that present with acute psychosis and catatonia. Brief Psychotic Disorder is possible due to the rapid onset and recovery, but the medical symptoms and fever suggest a medical etiology. Schizophreniform Disorder is less likely because of the medical symptoms and rapid recovery. Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features could explain the depressed mood and hallucinations, but again, the medical symptoms and catatonia point elsewhere. Delirium might be considered due to encephalopathy on EEG, but the presentation and progression don't fully match.\n\nWait, the EEG showed moderate encephalopathy, which indicates a medical cause. So, the primary diagnosis should be one that accounts for both psychiatric and neurological symptoms. Catatonic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition fits because of the catatonia and medical context. Then, since the medical condition isn't fully specified, it might be due to the post-COVID-19 state. \n\nOther possibilities: Unspecified Mental Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (like encephalitis), but catatonia is a prominent feature, so specifying catatonic disorder is better. Also, considering the psychotic symptoms, Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition could be secondary. Mood symptoms could be part of the same condition.\n\nGiven the full recovery, conditions like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder are less likely. The response to benzodiazepines and lack of response to antipsychotics further supports catatonia due to a medical cause. The fever and twitching suggest possible autoimmune encephalitis, even if not confirmed, so that could be the underlying medical condition.\n\nSo, structuring the diagnoses: Primary is Catatonic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (post-COVID-19 or possible encephalitis). Secondary could include Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition, Brief Psychotic Disorder (if considering the psychotic episode separately), Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features (though less likely due to medical symptoms), and maybe Unspecified Mental Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition for the mood and anxiety symptoms. \n\nBut I need to stick to DSM-5-TR and ICD-10 codes. Catatonic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition is F06.1. Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition is F06.2. Brief Psychotic Disorder is F23. Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features is F32.3. Maybe Delirium Due to Another Medical Condition is F05, but the vignette doesn't strongly support delirium aside from encephalopathy on EEG, but the patient's presentation seems more catatonic than delirious.\n\nWait, the EEG showed moderate encephalopathy, which could indicate delirium, but the symptoms described (mutism, immobility) are more catatonic. Delirium often has fluctuating consciousness, which isn't mentioned here. So, probably not delirium.\n\nAnother thought: the patient had headaches, fever, twitching, which might point to an organic brain syndrome. So, Unspecified Mental Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (F09) could cover the overall presentation without specifying catatonia or psychosis separately. But since catatonia is prominent, it's better to list it as primary.\n\nI should prioritize based on the presentation. The catatonic features were a major part, so that's primary. Then psychotic symptoms, which could be part of the same condition or separate. Given the medical context, it's likely all due to the same underlying cause. So, secondary diagnoses might include the medical condition itself, but since we're listing psychiatric diagnoses with F-codes, we stick to the mental disorders.\n\nSo, top five:\n1. Catatonic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (post-COVID-19 state or possible encephalitis) - F06.1\n2. Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition - F06.2\n3. Brief Psychotic Disorder - F23\n4. Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features - F32.3\n5. Unspecified Mental Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition - F09\n\nBut I need to ensure these are the most likely based on the vignette. Brief Psychotic Disorder might be less likely because of the medical symptoms and catatonia. Maybe Delirium should be considered instead. Let's check: the patient had encephalopathy on EEG, fever, twitching, which could indicate delirium. However, the presentation with mutism, immobility is more catatonic. Delirium often involves attention deficits, disorientation, which aren't mentioned. So, probably not.\n\nAnother possibility: Schizophreniform Disorder, but the duration is less than a month, and there's full recovery, so Brief Psychotic Disorder is more appropriate if considering a primary psychotic disorder. But given the medical context, the due to another medical condition diagnoses are more fitting.\n\nI think the primary is clearly Catatonic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition. The others are secondary considerations. Let me list them in order of likelihood based on the presentation.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me break down this clinical case vignette step by step. The patient is a 16-year-old Asian male with no prior psychiatric history, presenting with dizziness, low blood pressure, and significant weight loss. School nurse raised concerns, leading to a CPS report for possible neglect. The patient reports feeling overwhelmed with school and depressed mood for 6-8 months. Key points here: academic pressure, depressive symptoms, and malnutrition signs like low BMI and orthostatic hypotension.\n\nHe shows dysphoria, downcast eyes, thought blocking, constricted affect, and avoids eye contact. He admits to recurrent death thoughts and having a plan but doesn\u2019t disclose it. Family notices withdrawal, tiredness, lack of appetite, and weight loss. There\u2019s a history of school bullying. After admission, his condition worsens: he becomes mute, refuses food and movement, doesn\u2019t follow directions, and has staring spells with unusual mannerisms.\n\nFirst, the primary issue seems to be a severe depressive episode with suicidal ideation and plan, which aligns with Major Depressive Disorder. The duration is 6-8 months, and symptoms include depressed mood, anhedonia (withdrawal, lack of appetite), weight loss, fatigue, and recurrent death thoughts. The deterioration into mutism and catatonic features (staring, refusal to move) suggests catatonia, possibly as part of the depressive episode.\n\nNext, the significant weight loss, refusal to eat, and malnutrition point to an eating disorder. Given the age and gender, Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) or Anorexia Nervosa are possibilities, but without body image distortion mentioned, ARFID might fit better. However, the weight loss and food refusal could also be secondary to depression.\n\nThe abrupt onset of mutism, staring, and unusual mannerisms after admission raises the possibility of a psychotic disorder. Given the depressive symptoms, it could be Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features or a first episode of schizophrenia. However, the timeline is short, and the psychotic symptoms appear after admission, so maybe it\u2019s a catatonic syndrome rather than primary psychosis.\n\nConsidering the history of bullying and academic pressure, adjustment disorder with depressed mood is possible, but the severity and duration (6-8 months) exceed typical adjustment disorder. Also, the catatonic features suggest a more severe condition.\n\nThe patient\u2019s deterioration into mutism and catatonia could indicate Catatonic Disorder Due to Another Mental Disorder, likely linked to the depressive episode. Alternatively, it could be a manifestation of a neurodevelopmental disorder like autism, but there\u2019s no prior developmental history mentioned, so less likely.\n\nPutting it all together, the primary diagnosis should be Major Depressive Disorder, severe with psychotic features and catatonia, given the suicidal ideation, plan, and catatonic symptoms. Secondary diagnoses include ARFID due to malnutrition and food refusal, followed by possible schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder, adjustment disorder, and catatonia as a separate entity if not already included in the primary diagnosis.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, the user wants me to act as an expert psychiatrist diagnosing a clinical case vignette based on DSM-5-TR criteria. I need to follow the provided rubric for clinical reasoning but not include that reasoning in the final output. Let me start by carefully extracting and organizing the key information from the vignette.\n\nFirst, the patient is a 16-year-old Hispanic female with a history of chronic sexual abuse and witnessing violence during migration. She has PTSD diagnosed six months ago. The main issue now is severe verbal outbursts at school, triggered by perceived criticism or sudden changes. She's intelligent, articulate when calm, but guarded. She denies hallucinations, SI, or substance use. Sleep disturbances like nightmares and early awakening are present. \n\nI need to generate the top five diagnoses with ICD-10 F-codes. The primary should be the most likely given the history and symptoms. PTSD seems primary due to the trauma history, nightmares, and hypervigilance. But the outbursts suggest something else too. \n\nReactive Attachment Disorder? She's 16, and RAD usually starts in early childhood. Maybe Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder, but she's guarded, not overly familiar. Adjustment Disorder with Disturbance of Conduct? Possible, but the trauma history points more to PTSD. \n\nWhat about Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder? The outbursts might not fully fit PTSD criteria. But the vignette says PTSD was previously diagnosed. Maybe it's still the primary. \n\nSecondary diagnoses: Persistent Depressive Disorder? She has anger, mistrust, but not clearly depressed mood. Anxiety disorders? She has fear in unfamiliar environments. Could be Generalized Anxiety Disorder. \n\nDisruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder? She's 16, but onset before age 10 is required. Not suitable. Oppositional Defiant Disorder? Frequent anger outbursts, but PTSD might explain them. Still, ODD could be comorbid. \n\nBorderline Personality Disorder? She's 16, so personality disorders are tricky, but BPD can be diagnosed in adolescents. The fear of abandonment, anger outbursts, and trauma history fit. However, the vignette doesn't mention other BPD criteria like self-harm or identity disturbance. \n\nAdjustment Disorder with Mixed Disturbance of Emotions and Conduct? Since the outbursts are recent and related to school stressors. But the trauma history is more chronic. \n\nI think PTSD is primary. Then ODD due to the pattern of angry outbursts. Maybe Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Also, Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder if PTSD doesn't cover all symptoms. Lastly, Adjustment Disorder as a possibility. \n\nWait, the rubric says to consider less obvious possibilities. Could it be PTSD with prominent irritability and anger? That fits. But DMDD is ruled out due to age. BPD is a possibility given trauma and interpersonal issues. \n\nLet me list the top five:\n1. PTSD - F43.10\n2. ODD - F91.3\n3. Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder - F43.8\n4. Generalized Anxiety Disorder - F41.1\n5. Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Disturbance of Emotions and Conduct - F43.25\n\nI should ensure the codes are correct. PTSD is F43.10, ODD F91.3, Other Specified Trauma F43.8, GAD F41.1, Adjustment Disorder F43.25. \n\nBut is ODD appropriate? She's 16, and the outbursts might be better explained by PTSD. However, comorbid ODD is common in trauma-exposed youth. The vignette mentions outbursts triggered by perceived criticism, which aligns with ODD's defiant behavior. \n\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder: She has persistent fear and mistrust, but is it excessive worry about multiple things? The vignette mentions fear in specific situations. Maybe it's more specific to trauma. \n\nOther Specified Trauma Disorder could capture the outbursts if they're not fully accounted for by PTSD. Adjustment Disorder is plausible given the school stressors. \n\nI think this list covers the likely diagnoses based on the information provided.",

    "vignette":"An 18-year-old African American female was referred by her primary care provider (PCP) for evaluation of passive thoughts of death. The patient has been under her PCP\u2019s care for persistent dizziness, failure to gain weight, persistent nausea and reported dysphagia. She presents with a complex psychosocial history. She lives with her single mother, following the death of her maternal grandmother, two years ago. Her maternal grandmother raised her since the age of 8 years old, shortly after her father died in a motor vehicle accident when she was eight years old, an event she witnessed, although she denies current post-traumatic stress symptoms. Despite significant personal hardship, she graduated early from high school and is currently working two jobs, though she expresses dissatisfaction with college and reports feeling disconnected from peers. Recently separated from her boyfriend of 1 year. Upon initial exam, the patient endorsed symptoms of low mood, irritability, and insomnia. She was tearful throughout the interview. Stated that she likes gardening and going out for walks. However, reported chronic poor appetite with nausea, fear of choking while eating, and has lost significant weight. Physical exam showed pale mucosa.  CBC shows iron-deficiency anemia, bradycardia, and irregular menses. Gastrointestinal and ENT evaluations, including imaging, esophagoscopy, and laryngoscopy, were unremarkable. Despite reported dysphagia, there are no structural findings. She attempted to use marijuana to increase her appetite, but found it ineffective. Socially, she has few supports and describes conflict with peers due to ongoing irritability.",

    "model_thoughts":"Okay, let me start by carefully reading the clinical vignette provided. The patient is an 18-year-old African American female with passive thoughts of death. She's been under her PCP's care for persistent dizziness, failure to gain weight, nausea, and dysphagia. There's a complex psychosocial history: she lives with her single mother after her maternal grandmother died two years ago. Her grandmother raised her since she was eight, right after her father died in a motor vehicle accident, which she witnessed. She denies current PTSD symptoms.\n\nShe graduated early from high school, works two jobs, but is dissatisfied with college and feels disconnected from peers. Recently separated from her boyfriend. Symptoms include low mood, irritability, insomnia, tearfulness, poor appetite with nausea, fear of choking while eating, and significant weight loss. Physical exam shows pale mucosa, iron-deficiency anemia, bradycardia, irregular menses. GI and ENT evaluations were unremarkable, no structural issues despite dysphagia. She tried marijuana for appetite but it didn't help. Socially, she has few supports and conflicts due to irritability.\n\nFirst, I need to extract key clinical details. Passive thoughts of death, low mood, irritability, insomnia, tearfulness\u2014these point toward a depressive disorder. The fear of choking while eating and significant weight loss despite unremarkable medical evaluations suggest an eating disorder, possibly Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) or anorexia nervosa. However, she doesn't mention body image issues, which is common in anorexia, so maybe ARFID given the fear without weight or shape concerns.\n\nShe has a history of trauma (witnessing father's death) but denies current PTSD symptoms, so that might be ruled out. The psychosocial stressors are significant: multiple losses, recent breakup, social isolation. The physical symptoms like dizziness, nausea, weight loss, anemia, bradycardia, and irregular menses could be due to malnutrition from restricted eating, which aligns with an eating disorder.\n\nNow, organizing the data: mood symptoms (depression), eating-related fears and behaviors, physical complications from malnutrition, psychosocial stressors, and no structural cause for dysphagia. The differential diagnosis should consider conditions that explain both the mood and eating issues.\n\nPrimary diagnosis: Major Depressive Disorder given the low mood, irritability, insomnia, passive thoughts of death, and tearfulness. That fits F32.9. \n\nSecondary diagnoses: \n1. Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) because of the fear of choking leading to restricted intake, weight loss, and nutritional deficiencies without body image issues. That's F50.8.\n2. Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood might be considered given multiple stressors (losses, breakup), but the symptoms seem more pervasive, so maybe not primary.\n3. Generalized Anxiety Disorder could be possible given fears around eating, but the vignette doesn't emphasize other anxiety symptoms.\n4. Somatic Symptom Disorder since she has physical symptoms (dizziness, nausea) without medical explanation, but the focus is more on eating.\n5. Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder if ARFID doesn't fully capture it, but ARFID seems appropriate.\n\nAlso, the bradycardia and irregular menses suggest medical complications from an eating disorder, so that supports ARFID or another eating disorder. She doesn't have body image distortion, so anorexia nervosa is less likely. \n\nConsidering the differential: \n- Major Depressive Disorder (primary)\n- Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder\n- Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (if ARFID isn't a perfect fit)\n- Adjustment Disorder\n- Anxiety Disorders (like specific phobia of choking)\n\nBut I need to stick to DSM-5-TR and ICD-10 codes. The top five most likely: \n1. Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Unspecified (F32.9)\n2. Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (F50.8)\n3. Other Specified Depressive Disorder (if MDD isn't fully met, but it seems it is)\n4. Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (F50.8 as well, but maybe F50.89)\nWait, ARFID is under F50.8, so that's covered.\n\nPerhaps add Unspecified Anxiety Disorder (F41.9) given the fear of choking, but it might be part of ARFID. \n\nAlternatively, consider Persistent Complex Bereavement Disorder given the losses, but she denies PTSD symptoms, so maybe not.\n\nLet me list them: \n1. Major Depressive Disorder - F32.9\n2. Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder - F50.8\n3. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder (for choking phobia) - F41.8\n4. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood - F43.21\n5. Unspecified Feeding or Eating Disorder - F50.9\n\nBut I think the eating issue is central, so ARFID is key. The depression is also prominent. The anxiety around eating might be part of ARFID, so maybe not a separate anxiety disorder. Adjustment disorder could be considered due to multiple stressors, but the symptoms are more severe and chronic, so MDD takes precedence.\n\nFinal list: \n1. Major Depressive Disorder - F32.9\n2. Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder - F50.8\n3. Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder - F50.89 (if ARFID isn't fully applicable)\n4. Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood - F43.23\n5. Unspecified Anxiety Disorder - F41.9\n\nBut I need to ensure each is distinct. Maybe replace some with relevant codes. Let me check ICD-10: \n- F32.9 for MDD\n- F50.8 for ARFID\n- F43.21 for Adjustment with depressed mood\n- F41.1 for Generalized anxiety, but not enough symptoms\n- F45.1 for Somatic symptom disorder, given physical symptoms without cause\n\nHowever, the physical symptoms are tied to eating, so maybe not somatic symptom disorder. \n\nGiven the vignette, the top five are likely:\n1. Major Depressive Disorder\n2. Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder\n3. Adjustment Disorder\n4. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder (choking phobia)\n5. Unspecified Feeding or Eating Disorder as a fallback.\n\nBut I should prioritize based on likelihood. MDD and ARFID are top. Then maybe adjustment disorder due to stressors. Then anxiety related to eating. Finally, a residual eating disorder category.\n\nThus, the structured list:\n1. Major Depressive Disorder - F32.9\n2. Avoidant\/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder - F50.8\n3. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood - F43.21\n4. Other Specified Anxiety Disorder - F41.8\n5. Unspecified Feeding or Eating Disorder - F50.9\n\nThat seems comprehensive and based on the data.",

    "vignette":"A 62 years old Caucasian male (previously married with two adult children, and was working full time but, currently homeless) with history of hypertension, diabetes, asthma, systolic heart failure, and anxiety presented to emergency department (ED) with complaints of lower body weakness, psychosis and irritability with law enforcement officer after the patient was found lying down in the middle of a moderately busy road. The officer mentioned he was awake with eyes open, talking to self and screaming intermittently, but couldn\u2019t get up when asked to move. Upon evaluation by the provider, the patient was making statements such as \u201cthey are watching us with AI gadgets\u201d and brought themes of paranoia in the conversations.

Otherwise, routine lab values of blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, urea, liver function tests, urinalysis, thyroid profile and vitamin b12 and folic acid were within normal limits.

    "model_thoughts":"Hmm, this is a complex clinical case requiring careful analysis. The patient is a 62-year-old male with multiple medical comorbidities presenting with acute psychosis, irritability, and lower body weakness. The key findings include paranoid delusions about AI surveillance, disorganized thought process, hypoglycemia (glucose 44 mg\/dL), bradycardia, and notably a positive VDRL at 1:16 titer.\n\nThe hypoglycemia likely explains the acute weakness and altered mental status, but the chronic psychotic symptoms suggest an underlying psychiatric or neuropsychiatric condition. The positive VDRL is particularly significant - a titer of 1:16 indicates possible neurosyphilis, which can present with psychiatric symptoms like psychosis and mood changes. The patient's homelessness and multiple medical issues also point to potential substance-related or medical etiologies.\n\nFor differential diagnosis, neurosyphilis must be high on the list given the VDRL result and psychiatric presentation. The acute psychosis could be due to multiple factors - either a primary psychotic disorder exacerbated by medical issues, or a direct result of medical conditions like neurosyphilis or hypoglycemia. The irritability and disorganization might indicate a mood component too.\n\nThe formatting request specifies listing only diagnoses with F-codes without clinical reasoning. I'll prioritize based on likelihood: neurosyphilis-related psychosis seems most probable given the VDRL result, followed by other psychotic disorders that might explain the chronic symptoms, then mood disorders that could account for irritability, and finally substance-related issues given the homelessness context (though drug screen was negative).",
